businessman right now after his retirement\n\n<$A> \n\n\nBut but Portland is your favorite team\n\n<$B> \n\n\nYeah Portland then I guess after Portland that would be, uhm, that would be Sacramento\n\n<$A> \n\n\nSacramento Kings\n\n\n\nWhy why the Sacramento\n\n<$B> \n\n\nUh Weber is there Chris Weber\n\n<$A> \n\n\nChris Weber\n\n\n\nYou know there 's one guy there that I really love   Jason Williams  \n\n<$B> \n\n\n Jason Williams    oo  the point guard position\n\n<$A> \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\n\nWith all those assists those passes incredible positions after Earvin Johnson\n\n<$A>

Year\n\n<$A> \n\n\nVince Carter\n\n<$B> \n\n\nOf the Toronto Raptors\n\n<$A> \n\n\nBut I guess Vince Carter was not selected for the dream team you know that\n\n<$B> \n\n\nYeah he wasn't selected I

card\n\n<$B> \n\n\nUh I 'll give you a rookie card of Vitaly Pota Penko\n\n<$A> \n\n\nOws I don't know him\n\n<$B> \n\n\nYou don't know Vitaly Pota Penko\n\n<$A> \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\n\nHe 's the he 's the Romanian trainee for the I don't know he he 's a\n\n<$A> \n\n\nDo you have a card to have a card of Jason Williams do you have\n\n<$B> \n\n\nWell  ,  when this rookie season came in that 's when I started to uh lose interest in card-collecting so\n\n<$A> \n\n\n His card   \n\n How many cards do you have\n\n<$B> \n\n\nI can't count them\n\n<$A> \n\n\nCan you give   can you  give me five cards\n\n<$B> \n\n\n A lot   \n\n\n\nYou know like Vitaly Pota Penko\n\n<$A> \n\n\nNo   not the discards  \n\n<$B> \n\n\n There 's Sabonis   and there is\n\n<$A> \n\n\nNot the weak and not the weak ones\n\n<$B> \n\n\nAlright uhm well there 's Jason Kidd the Mailman Malone\n\n<$A> \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\n\nStockton\n\n<$A> \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\n\nUh Haleem Olajuwon\n\n<$A> \n\n\nUh-huh who else\n\n<$B> \n\n\nUh well David Robinson\n\n<$A> \n\n\nHow about uhm Tim Duncan can you give me a card\n\n<$B> \n\n\nTim Duncan I think I couldn't find one\n\n<$A> \n\n\nOh you 're not yet sure\n\n<$B> \n\n\nYeah I guess it was <unclear> word </unclear>, \n\n<$A> \n\n\nWell\n\n<$B> \n\n\nUh you know in in card collecting you you know it 's gone down with the popularity\n\n\n\nIt 's gone down I don't think because of Magic or because I think it 's because of you know the resignation of Jordan\n\n<$A> \n\n\nThat 's the reason why\n\n<$B> \n\n\nI think that 's primarily the reason\n\n<$A> \n\n\nProbably probably it 's because of Pokemon, \n\n<$B> \n\n\n  Uh  urhhh\n\n<$A> \n\n\n Uh   \n\n\n\nWhat do you think of Pokemon\n\n<$B> \n\n\nPokemon, yeah I think it was the best you know animation for this year because it does not you know show, it 's it 's  you know it 's, well all of them live no one dies\n\n<$A> \n\n\nIn Pokemon\n\n<$B> \n\n\nIn Pokemon no one dies I mean no no one you know cuts off his arm no bloodshed\n\n<$A> \n\n\nUh yeah yeah\n\n<$B> \n\n\nIt 's it 's like uh a very very mild portrayal of violence\n\n<$A> \n\n\nYeah some something good about Pokemon is that it doesn't portray portray too much of violence and, gore \n\n<$B> \n\n\nIf you ask me it 's for for girls you know\n\n<$A> \n\n\nOh no it 's not for girls\n\n<$B> \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\n\nI 'm fond I 'm fond of watching Pokemon\n\n\n\nI even collect Pokemons\n\n<$B> \n\n\n oh sorry no offense  \n\n<$A> \n\n\nIt 's alright that 's it that will be fine\n\n<$B> \n\n\nPikachu even got two you know those red thingamajigs you know on his cheeks you know \n\n\n\nWhat are those  what are those\n\n<$A> \n\n\nUhm that that is his weapon actually\n\n<$B> \n\n\n  Really  \n\n<$A> \n\n\n Yeah   uhm it shoots electricity\n\n<$B> \n\n\nAnd who is this Raichu,  \n\n\n\nWho is this Raichu\n\n<$A> \n\n\nRaichu\n\n<$B> \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\n\nOh he he Raichu is the uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n\nHe looks like   Pikachu but  \n\n<$A> \n\n\n Yeah   he looks like Pikachu\n\n\n\nHe is the evolved yeah Raichu is the evolved version of the of Pikachu\n\n<$B> \n\n\nBut, being evolved there are two distinct uh, Pokemons right\n\n<$A> \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\n\nLike I saw Pikachu and Raichu fighting\n\n<$A> \n\n\nYeah but then like because there are many Pikachus actually\n\n<$B> \n\n\nUh\n\n\n\n Ha  \n\n<$A> \n\n\nYeah there are many Pikachus\n\n\n\nIf you have if you saw the cartoon last night uhm there were many Pikachus okay\n\n\n\nSo one tends to evolve to a Raichu or one can just choose to remain as a Pikachu\n\n\n\nThat 's it\n\n\n\nHow about\n\n<$B> \n\n\nUh primetime man I speak of Voltes Five and Daimos\n\n<$A> \n\n\nVoltes Five\n\n\n\nNow who 's the better robot, Voltes Five or Daimos\n\n<$B> \n\n\nWait uh, I can't you know tell\n\n<$A> \n\n\nSomething like\n\n<$B> \n\n\nI like I like Daimos because of his, what 's that\n\n<$A> \n\n\nBlizzard\n\n<$B> \n\n\nUh or his death blow, and his blizzard yeah he had this snow blizzard\n\n<$A> \n\n\nSnow blizzard\n\n<$B> \n\n\nYeah at the end he had all these sorts of you know weapons snow blizzard and then the what 's this uh fire blizzard\n\n<$A> \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\n\nYeah, \n\n<$A> \n\n\nWhat do you think\n\n\n\nOkay something like, what if Daimos and Voltes Five are going to fight\n\n<$B> \n\n\nUh they can't fight because they 're both good robots\n\n<$A> \n\n\nNo something like, uhm they used the ones you usually read in Marvel Comics you see the Incredible Hulk fighting the Spiderman, \n\n<$B> \n\n\nThat 's no problem because that 's Marvel\n\n<$A> \n\n\nSo about\n\n<$B> \n\n\nThough I think what you were trying to say is D C against Marvel\n\n\n\nThey 're two separate companies\n\n<$A> \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\n\nWith two different heroes fighting each other\n\n<$A> \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\n\nYeah so with Daimos and Voltes Five\n\n<$A> \n\n\nWho do you think is going to win, \n\n<$B> \n\n\nOh boy well Voltes Five is a five-man team  five-man  robot and Daimos is only one but I think it 's evenly matched\n\n<$A> \n\n\nEvenly matched, with the weapons who do you think has\n\n<$B> \n\n\nHas more weapons\n\n<$A> \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\n\nI think it 's Daimos\n\n<$A> \n\n\nDaimos\n\n<$B> \n\n\nHas a lot more weapons\n\n<$A> \n\n\nThan Voltes Five\n\n<$B> \n\n\nYeah the problem with Voltes Five is you know there is five heads working altogether\n\n<$A> \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\n\nDaimos has only one head\n\n<$A> \n\n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\n\nSo I guess he 's more focused\n\n<$A> \n\n\nWhat made it a problem for Voltes Five having these five going around\n\n<$B> \n\n\nUh one head  chews the other   \n\n<$A> \n\n\nNow let 's go back to basketball\n\n<$B> \n\n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\n\nAbout the P B A\n\n<$B> \n\n\nP B A\n\n<$A> \n\n\nWhat 's your favorite team, \n\n<$B> \n\n\nA long time ago it used to be San Miguel Beer\n\n\n\nThat 's the time when I really liked watching P B A\n\n<$A> \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\n\nWith Brown uhm, who was that Samboy Lim with Teng with Caidic\n\n<$A> \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\n\nYeah they were the dream team for the Philippines\n\n<$A> \n\n\nHow about the present San Miguel team\n\n\n\nHow do you assess them\n\n<$B> \n\n\nI think they won the the last conference\n\n<$A> \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\n\n  Or no  \n\n<$A> \n\n\n Actually   the last two conferences they won it\n\n<$B> \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\n\nTwo\n\n<$A> \n\n\nYeah uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n\nUh by the way do you know who the players are already in San Miguel\n\n<$A> \n\n\nLine-up\n\n<$B> \n\n\nYeah line-up\n\n<$A> \n\n\nWell uhm, I guess uh\n\n\n\nHey somebody is writing something on the board\n\n<$B> \n\n\nYeah I don't know what he 's writing\n\n<$A> \n\n\nAnyway, oh the guy already left anyway  \n\n\n\nOh let 's uhm how about, Chicago Bulls\n\n\n\nWhat do you think\n\n\n\nDo you feel sorry about the Chicago Bulls for   <unclear> word </unclear>  \n\n<$B> \n\n\n Yeah   I mean it started out with a dream you know when when Chicago their dream was to get three-peat the three-peat\n\n<$A> \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\n\nYeah so once that dream was you know was came came to when they achieved that dream and then the uh I think the manager decided on having a new team uh no uh a team with new players to have a new target or  ,  goal\n\n<$A> \n\n\n I guess   \n\n\n\nI guess the team had already reached the point when uh something like we 're already at the top   of the world  \n\n<$B> \n\n\n Yeah   there is nothing more to   to gain  <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n After   \n\n\n\nSomething like we are we are the best in the world\n\n\n\nThere 's no other way but to go down\n\n\n\nWe 've already reached the top\n\n\n\nProbably they came to that point already and now they 're languishing at the bottom\n\n<$B> \n\n\nYeah well they 're already going down\n\n\n\nThey 're already at the bottom really  \n\n\n\nIn terms of  statistical you know outcome in the they 're really at the bottom   Chicago Bulls  \n\n<$A> \n\n\n Chicago Bulls   \n\n<$B> \n\n\nAnd they just have two wins four wins out of how many games\n\n<$A> \n\n\nI guess I guess they already have five wins just imagine five wins\n\n<$B> \n\n\nOut of thirty forty forty games something like that \n\n You know I think some of the core some of the line-up of last year was were still retained like Kukoch\n\n<$A> \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\n\nLike Brown\n\n<$A> \n\n\nRay Brown\n\n<$B> \n\n\nRandy  \n\n<$A> \n\n\nI guess it 's Randy

will advise this in the Philippine Normal College and she said  well I accepted because uhm she is a good student  and you know Fe seldom accepts to advise because\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUnless this student is very good\n\n\n But I thought you were resigning  \n\n\n Oh no I will be like you even if I 'm I 'm not there anymore I 'd like to advise  \n\n<$A> \n\nHow nice\n\n<$B>

those you know who have promise and so on like that, \n\n\nThat was the defect of  William  \n\n<$A> \n\nReally\n\n<$B> \n\nHe had a certain selfishness\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nInstead of helping people\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause Brother Andrew and you are the primary examples of people who help  ,  people  ,  who seek out excellence  ,  who are not threatened by excellence \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n Because   \n\n\n Uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n\nBut  William  is  William  somehow\n\n<$A> \n\nHow did that happen why\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nYet he 's very bright\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm very

 the request for my services after I came from abroad uh both came from the U P and from the P N C\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm, \n\n<$B> \n\nThe  request from uhm the late Fred Morales\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo naku  \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then P N C from  kwan  so I went to P N C and uh because nobody said that the reason that they were not uh their people were uh not getting their degrees is that nobody were advised\n\n\nAnd so I had the brilliant idea, which I thought was brilliant, of seeing to it, that I would be assigned, uhm and that all these people who were uh wanted to get their M A, after assigning their topics\n\n\nWe assigned we assigned somebody as the chairman and then some more some juniors some some relatively junior members of the faculty\n\n\nSo there we assigned five five advisers to every student three to five\n\n<$A> \n\nWow\n\n<$B> \n\nMembers of the faculty   all members  of the faculty\n\n<$A> \n\n My goodness   \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nAll members\n\n<$A> \n\nUh

thousand since uh January\nFebruary\n\n<$B> \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah because I gave her lots of bags to help me you know\ndispose of\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo she took it I mean took the responsibility to sell it\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\n Ano na ngayon  November  na  \n\n\nEvery month she tells me she promises me on  ganito\n\n I will on November like this on Wednesday I 'm gonna pay on like\nthis I 'm gonna pay you\n\n\nAnd then she was supposed to have paid me yesterday\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo she texted me on that day to tell me I 'm sorry that I\ncannot deliver today\n\n\nCan be my friend  ganoon pa siya  December five\n\n na lang  \n\n\nDecember five promise real  na  \n\n\nI got for December five  daw  \n\n\nMe I was calling her  na kasi  I didn't wanna go\ntexting galore\n\n\nShe didn't wanna answer my call kept on ringing her cell phone so\nso\n\n<$B> \n\nBeware I guess\n\n<$A> \n\nAnyway\n\n<$B> \n\nThere 're a lot of those people around\n\n<$A> \n\nI know I know\n\n\nSo I didn't  naman  force my bags on her  e\n\n \n\n\nShe was the one who who uh what do you call this uh volunteered\nshe was the one who who uh what do you call this uh volunteered  sige\n\n I 'll I 'll help you sell\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\n Kasi  in the process she 's gonna earn\n\n rin naman di ba  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo anyway so  tagal na yan  every month\n\n\nI needed it I mean my point is actually it 's not the money\n\n e  it 's five thousand so I told her Can you just give me a\npost-dated check because I also need it\n\n\n Kasi  you know what her reason was\n\n\n I had so many payables I had so many bills to pay so\n\n na-  short  ako  so I have to pay you next\nmonth  \n\n<$B> \n\n Grabe yan ha  \n\n<$A> \n\n Di ba  so  eto eto nga  with\nme  naman  when I was I texted her back kept texting her\n\n na  I 'm sorry about your problems but I have problems too\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\n I have payables too  ,  so I hope you\nmake it a priority  ,   \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nCan I have a post-dated check tonight\n\n\nI was that blunt\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat 'd she answer\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then then she asked me she was answering me  \nTalagang  I 'm so  gipit  I 'm so  gipit gipit\ngipit  or something\n\n\nSo me  naman  I didn't wanna stop there\n\n\nI told her why don't you ask your boy friend to lend you the five\nthousand\n\n\nAnd then all of a sudden she tells me don't involve my boy friend\nbecause it doesn't involve him\n\n<$B> \n\n Aba siya pa   ang mataray   \n\n<$A> \n\n So you know   what I said then don't involve me\nbecause I don't  kasi sabi niya  in fact I got  lugi\n\n in your bags because my friend didn't pay me\n\n\nAnd then I said I 'm sorry but I don't know your friend so please\ndon't involve me with your problem with your friend\n\n\nAnd then she said and then you know she changed the topic what 's\nfive thousand compared to your caprices\n\n\nThat 's what she told me\n\n\nAnd then I you know what I told her everything that I spend for my\ncaprices have been was was uh came from hard work\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nI mean if if I only had that cash I wouldn't go spending\n\n<$B> \n\n Grabe itong ano uh San Mig nakakatakot   \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah yeah San Miguel\n\n<$B> \n\n Huwag ka na lang lumapit diyan   \n\n<$A> \n\n Huwag ka na lang lumapit sa malaking ganyan  \n\n\nI mean if only  'no  if only\n\n<$B> \n\n Grabe siya ha  \n\n<$A> \n\n Di ba  the reasoning was really bad because\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah the reasoning was really bad  kasi  \nimagine he 'd she 'd tell me like that  na nalugi na nga ako para bang\npasalamat ka tinulungan kita  \n\n\nSo she will make  pasa  to me the problems of the\ntuition of her kids and all that\n\n\n Kasi  she she she uh expected me that I 've so\nmuch, dough\n\n<$B> \n\nBut still\n\n<$A> \n\nIf I had so even  di ba  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah even\n\n\nIt 's the principle behind it\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's the principle behind it  e  \n\n\n Sabi ko  so how about those I need to pay off\nwhere will I get it\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nPlease help me solve my problem  gumanoon ako e\n\n because  pinasa ko sa kanya  the  bola e\n\n \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then uh  kasi  I didn't like the tone\n\n e   yung yung  your caprices  kasi\n\n it has nothing to do with it\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nThat was not the point\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nThe point if you 've been\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd had I gotten the payment a long time ago I would have\nmade it  ikot  and made it even probably  double or\ntriple right\n\n<$B> \n\nExactly\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo bottom line was I told her five on December five then five\nthousand five hundred\n\n\nInterest  na e  I put  na  interest\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yeah  tama tama  \n\n<$A> \n\nTen percent\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nIs that okay with you\n\n\nGive me a   post-dated check  tonight\n\n\nI don't have checks that 's what she told me but I promise that\nDecember five and then I didn't anymore answer her\n\n\nActually it doesn't\n\n<$B> \n\n That 's right   yeah\n\n\nHow 'd you meet her how 'd you meet her  naman  \n\n<$A> \n\nFamily friend  yan e  \n\n\nShe used to board in our house her sister\n\n<$B> \n\nDon't do wholesale\n\n\nI got  loko na rin  <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nNo it 's not that  e  \n\n\nShe 's not the type she 's very naive in fact\n\n<$B> \n\nHow many times has that happened\n\n\nOnce first time a thousand the other one was nineteen\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean but that 's that 's part of the game  e\n\n Pinks the risk that was the risk I took when I gave her the bags\n\n\nIt was the risk I took when I gave  Techie  the bags\n\n\nWe have to take risks  e  \n\n\nOn her end on her end when she gave her friend that that was her\nrisk not mine so don't make me  pasa na  she has not paid me\nyet so I can't pay you\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nYou have to take responsibility for that  e  \n\n\nI gave her how many months already\n\n\n Ano ba naman yung  every month she 'll save up a\nhundred instead of texting all her she she spends around four thousand pesos\nfor cell phone usage\n\n\nAnd I don't like her reasoning  na  she doesn't\nwanna pay me because it 's not her priority because I have money\n\n\nBecause she doesn't know what I 'm going through\n\n\nYou get me\n\n\nIt 's like  Techie  it 's not the money\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's why you know what I don't even care if I get that\nfive thousand five hundred  e  \n\n<$B> \n\nActually\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause the ball is on her  ano na  hand\n\n e  \n\n\nNow I can say something about her now she cannot say anything\nabout me  na  \n\n\nShe can always deny it but my conscience is clear\n\n\nI 've given her so much leeway already\n\n\nI mean I 'm so  ano   1 1", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

\n\n Assumption   \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I went to U P for college took up Business Administration\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n\nAnd then I took my masters M B A in Louvaine a Catholic university in Belgium\n\n<$A> \n\nUh in Belgium\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah and I finished it in eighty-one\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd now you 're working with   Union Bank  \n\n<$B> \n\n I work with   \n\n\nNo, uh well actually, it 's an affiliate of Union Bank\n\n\nIt 's called U B C Capital Corporation it 's an investment house\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd you 've been with them for how many years\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I started out working at the Union Bank since nineteen eighty-eight\n\n<$A> \n\nUp to   your <unclear> word </unclear>  \n\n<$B> \n\n Up to now   \n\n\nThe the we left the investment house for we were the investment bank division in the bank and we formed the investment house\n\n\nWe left the investment bank to join the investment house\n\n\nSo practically speaking we built that on the purpose of <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay, so I 'll be starting on, your life before you became a public figure\n\n<$B> \n\nAre you saying when I was much younger\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah, if you could say if you can recall  anything that you can remember, \n\n<$B> \n\nSo those   things  \n\n<$A> \n\n How   how that was or how you spent your days\n\n\nWhat you did\n\n<$B> \n\nAll I remember when we were kids, when we were 'cause we started out actually in in nineteen sixty-three was his political  career started out when he was appointed\n\n\nI think it was in nineteen sixty-two, when he was appointed as Secretary of Justice\n\n<$A> \n\nBy whom\n\n<$B> \n\nBy, President Macapagal\n\n\nBut before that, he was just a lawyer  'no  an ordinary lawyer\n\n\nAnd what I remember of about him was just that he was at work and he would always be home at night\n\n\nAnd weekends is what I remember is that we 'll always be together\n\n\nEvery Sunday we would have to go to Mass and then after Mass, we would go, sometimes we would eat lunch or out\n\n\nSometimes we 'd be at home\n\n\nAnd after lunch or on he would take pictures\n\n\nThat was his hobby\n\n<$A> \n\n  Taking pictures  \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh we   we used to live there in the Boulevard\n\n\nSo we would walk across along the bay and then we would take a, pose for him  \n\n\nHe 'd take pictures that that was the normal routine\n\n\nThat much I remember but I  I guess you 'll have to ask me more, more questions  na lang , or when we get to the, generally it was the fact that he was around when we wanted him\n\n\nHe was more like uh, he was I would say he was really a family man, 'cause he was always with us\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I don't know, uhm how, politically involved he was then\n\n\nI was much too young,   because  actually he, was appointed Secretary of Justice I was only about ten years old\n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nSo I wouldn't   really know  \n\n<$A> \n\n You wouldn't be able to remember   \n\n<$B> \n\nNo, I wouldn't remember much, except  'no  the usual kid stuff\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I do remember the Sundays that we would spend uh taking pictures walking in the Boulevard\n\n\nAnd there used to be  bancas  along the Boulevard\n\n\n  And now, not anymore  \n\n<$A> \n\n Back then    \n\n<$B> \n\nBack then, and, sometimes we would ask the fisherman who owned the boat if we could use the  banca  to take pictures of us, inside the  banca  or whatever\n\n\nWe would not be on the water just along the  ,  along the bay because it was quite okay to walk through there walking around there like that\n\n\nThat much I remember about those Sundays\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh   \n\n\nSo he was really more a homebody stay at home\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah,   we didn't have  \n\n<$A> \n\n And his office   was here  ano  here\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nAt that time, when we were growing, uh his office only moved to the house after Martial Law\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause before Martial Law his office was in, M H Del Pilar, the building of  Lola  Long\n\n\n  There was a building , there that I think Daddy used\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh I see   \n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know what how, how it came about that, Daddy had his office there\n\n\nThat office has about three or four floors with the lawyers\n\n\nAnd when Martial Law came and Dad was picked up uhm, well of course the office had to be closed because Daddy really didn't know how long he was gonna be   inside  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n<$B> \n\nSo, then we moved all the books, all his books   uh to  the house\n\n\nThen, the office was moved to the house, <unclear> 3 words </unclear> of the building  na rin  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom that time on that was the time   when the office  \n\n<$A> \n\n You used to   \n\n<$B> \n\nBefore, that, his office I remember going to Regina Building\n\n\nThat much I remember near the Church his office is along Escolta Regina Building, that much I remember\n\n\nAnd we would go there and pick him up that time   from the office  \n\n<$A> \n\n Oh really yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\nWe 'd go there pick him up then he 'd take us out\n\n\nSometimes we 'd go to the movies at night, along Escolta\n\n\nYou know that 's really weird\n\n\nThat much I remember about him\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh but what particular hobbies, did he have, you know things photography for one you mentioned\n\n<$B> \n\nPhotography for one definitely because sometimes he would he would call us to help him in the dark room\n\n\nHe had a dark room in the   house  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh   how nice\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd he would make us go in just to mix the chemicals for him or help him\n\n\nHe never really made us do all the hard stuff, just to be just to be there\n\n\nHe 'd ask you okay you mix this for me you watch this, you know\n\n\nThings like that, but that 's what he would do\n\n\nPhotography is really the thing that I remember\n\n\nHe loved to fiddle with his cameras\n\n\nHe was so excited every time he 'd go find a new lens, or a new what\n\n\nHe 's excited also when he 's printing his own pictures you know   the ones that  he would take\n\n\nThat I remember\n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\nWhat about  ,  reading writing\n\n<$B> \n\n Reading   \n\n<$A> \n\nDo you have any literary,   things  he did or was it mostly essays\n\n<$B> \n\n That   \n\n\nWell no\n\n\nThey don't <unclear> 1 word </unclear> it also when he was inside\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I heard he wrote he wrote you poems    'no   \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nI remember\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause I told you he would write us letters 'cause when he was under detention that was the time when we well we we had to <unclear> 1 word </unclear> \n\n\nFirst we were allowed to visit him every day\n\n\nThen the military said no\n\n\nIt had to be  mga  once a week  lang  or twice a week\n\n\nIn  they would use it as  psycho war you know like, just to break you or to make you feel as a like it was some kind of mental torture\n\n\nBecause suddenly you go there for a visit and then they would say no visits allowed today \n\n\nYou 're there already all set to fix his meal\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then you 'd bring food because that was what we would always do bring food and whatever\n\n\nAnd then they would say no and and no reason they wouldn't give you any reason, why you couldn't visit\n\n\nCome back tomorrow or come back and when you come back the next day and there would still be no visits\n\n\nThings like that\n\n\nSo, what Dad would do was he would write us letters uhm especially on dates like your birthday Christmas uh or if if there was some kind of problems we were having that   time that  Mom would tell him about then he 'd write a letter\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nI remember graduation from college he wrote me a letter\n\n\nBut this this would be censored because the military would pass,   would pass  through them\n\n<$A> \n\n Really   \n\n<$B> \n\nThe only time I remember that that they really cut up\n\n\nI think we still have it somewhere the military cut up, some words you know,  literally censoring it  'no  the letter was during that time I think it was before or after, he was in solitary\n\n<$A> \n\nNow how long how long was that\n\n<$B> \n\nWell that was the time they went to they moved them to Nueva Ecija   for one month  \n\n<$A> \n\n So they did   change\n\n\nThey did change   location  \n\n<$B> \n\n They moved them   for about one month\n\n\nAnd then we couldn't visit for about that during that time\n\n\nAnd they wouldn't tell us where Daddy was\n\n<$A> \n\nDid they did they change him in any way\n\n\nDid they do you you recall any specific change in his personality, after his detention or even during his detention when you would go visit him, \n\n\n  How was he  \n\n<$B> \n\n Uhm   \n\n<$A> \n\nWas he the same\n\n<$B> \n\nSame I think\n\n\nUh if anything I think it made him a more human person\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause uhm I think that was when his, his, thoughts on human rights began to crystallize\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> when that 's when he that 's why when he got out when he was he when he was released that was the time that he started uh all of his human rights work and going around the country and talking and defending these people\n\n\nThat was when it really started\n\n\nBut he was always the type who was looking for the family for support\n\n\nAnd since we knew that he had done nothing illegal to deserve being put in jail except he was just a very vocal critic of Marcos at that time then we were not afraid\n\n\nWell of, no I don't think we were afraid and we were supportive of him and there were people who would come to us and say oh just tell him to do what Marcos wants and you know everything \n\n\nBut why he has not done anything wrong so Dad has always been a very principled person so this is he was the one who taught us all he <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n\nIf there 's anything wrong since you haven't done anything wrong and you believe that what you 're doing is correct why should you you know\n\n<$A> \n\nJust do what you want\n\n<$B> \n\nJust to do just to do what somebody else wants\n\n\nSo that was what he lived by\n\n\nActually the last I think the last uh let 's say the last uh twenty years I think because he died in eighty-seven  'no   ,  and he was imprisoned in seventy-two so he was released in seventy-four\n\n\nSo  mga  the last thirteen to fifteen years of his life was really devoted to human rights, ever since prison because in fact what happened was in prison he could do everything what he couldn't do before that because he was a Senator you know he had to do a lot of things like the Senate work\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then he had his law office and then you know speaking engagements and all that stuff\n\n\nSo, then then he could read he read a lot then he could write he could think it was like you know when you 're a very busy person and suddenly you 're given a time to do what you always say oh yeah if I had the time I could do it \n\n\nSo I think that 's the time that he had\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nI think although of course what was often a strain on him was being away physically\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> 3 words </unclear> \n\n\nWe never needed him so much\n\n\nIt 's only I guess when we, we on our part maybe we also we also suffered from the separation although we didn't we don't really think about it\n\n\nActually after Martial Law not  after Martial Law after Dad was released when people would ask me about it I would always say like it 's just a part of my life \n\n<$A>

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWhat what 's the breakdown\n\n<$B> \n\nUh we usually share depends on how many are we we divide it\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nEven cleaning of the room we even have to pay because normally\nI was in an office even it it 's government even if it was government we\nwould have a utility worker or somebody among the staff members to clean the\nroom\n\n\nBut here even if I think there 's a person really supposed to be a\nutility worker position I entered that office already with a with the system\nwherein somebody will clean the room and each of us will pay a certain amount\nper month\n\n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nUh so it 's like you 're paying this guy he 's he 's your\nemployee\n\n<$B> \n\nWell our employee in terms of cleaning but we just give a\nminimal amount and she cleans the room after we leave the office\n\n<$A> \n\nIs this an everyday thing\n\n\nSo you pay her monthly\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah we do pay her monthly it 's up uh we have this certain\namount and uh the thing with my room there 's there are windows but it 's not\nlike you can open and it 's small\n\n\nJust like when there 's brown-out it 's so hard uh for us to see\nbecause we 'll just depend on that glass window or the sunlight to come in if\nthere 's a sun shining\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what happens if like there 's a black-out a brown-out\n\n<$B> \n\nUh they have to open the door downstairs and\n\n<$A> \n\nThe room must be very dark\n\n<$B> \n\nIt is except for the one the mezzanine wherein the light\nthrough the outside would penetrate just a small portion\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd what else do you have to pay for aside from the janitress\n\n<$B> \n\nWell if we don't have enough supplies for materials   \n\n<unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n<$A> \n\n You mean   for the supplies also\n\n<$B> \n\nSometimes sometimes like ballpens you know you end up buying 'cause\nif they don't have enough supply how many are we there in the office or they\nrun out of supply rather than wait we have to be on our own\n\n\nSo the money we bring home aside from the taxes would be spent for\nthose other expenses\n\n\nBut you know it 's not like it 's all the time\n\n\nMinimal sometimes\n\n<$A> \n\nBut you 're not reimbursed for it\n\n<$B> \n\nNo maybe because we 'd I don't think they really made an\nattempt  if you look at it will you want to reimburse ballpens or\n\n  <unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n<$A> \n\n  O    but all these things add up\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's true but when I got there that was already the system\n\n\nThat 's how they deal with it\n\n\nThey pay a certain amount for this or that so I just follow\nwhatever  oo  \n\n<$A> \n\nSo doesn't does this this situation doesn't it make you\nconsider uh working in an  a private   firm  where\n\n ,  you don't have to pay for all these things\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh   \n\n\n Yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n\nUh actually right now I 'm not really thinking of that maybe\nbecause I have so much to learn wherein in this office I 'm learning Uh so\nmaybe it 's not like I 'm planning on going or or leaving that office\n\n\nUh you just have to make some sacrifices and at the same time right\nnow I 'm just having a positive attitude to enjoy working there because at\nleast what makes it more bearable is I have good officemates\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy did you transfer anyway from the your old office which is\nalso a government office right\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's true\n\n\nUh because at that time I wasn't a lawyer yet and uh my work\ninvolved more uh administrative not so much with the legal work\n\n\nBut because uh it was time already to go and practice and uh it was\na suggestion from my mom and okay we 'll try it and I did\n\n\nOf course in the beginning it was not that easy because so many\nthings you have to learn\n\n<$A> \n\nYou mean you couldn't you couldn't work as a lawyer in that\nold office   <unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n<$B> \n\n Nah   as a lawyer no because it was  \nit was more administrative position so now since if I wanted to practice uh I\nhad to find another job\n\n<$A> \n\n  And this pays   \n\n<$B> \n\n This was the one   \n\n<$A> \n\nThis pays better than the old one\n\n<$B> \n\nNot really because it 's the same salary grade  as a\nmatter of fact I think I 'm getting lesser compensation but it 's more of\nwhat is important to learn or to earn\n\n\nAnd I guess I wanted to\n\n<$A> \n\nBoth  \n\n<$B> \n\nBoth ideally but you know you can't have everything so maybe\nthe first thing is to learn something first you know and have the right to do\nso  yon  \n\n\nSo  ano  more or less it 's manageable\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you 're happy\n\n\nYou 're happy\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm happy because I mean I 'm meeting other people although\nthat 's the time it could be a test because you don't know the personalities\nand they just show you you know you 're being treated in different ways or\nyou treat them also depending on their level or what they would uhm you know\nhow they carry themselves or how you carry themselves to help them\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat sort of people  ba  do you have to deal\nwith\n\n<$B> \n\nUh well all kinds but of course you can't say the top echelon\nbecause since we 're government it 's more of free legal service for them so\nit 's not those who really are moneyed\n\n\nMore or less I guess from the middle class or lower class but most\nof them their fights involve neighborhood misunderstandings  e\n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n  Criminal  cases\n\n<$B> \n\n They  criminal\n\n\nCriminal only so uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nNeighborhood fights but did you have really serious ones like\nrape\n\n<$B> \n\nUh not handling that yet 'cause since I 'm relatively new I\nhave only this particular court wherein these are the cases handled for this\ncourt so rape no not yet\n\n\nBut we have this uh thing wherein for investigation we if we 're\nassigned with let 's say that kind of case we can  we can look at\nit if there is a basis for filing the complaint or not\n\n\nBut you know as I said my  I 'm I 'm still learning\nand my position is not high enough in comparison to the other people there so\nwe also have uh particular cases assigned wherein slowly they 're adding or\nmaking it a little more uh serious or complicated cases but not like the\nother uh people who have more serious charges\n\n<$A> \n\n you find this fulfilling  ba  \n\n<$B> \n\nWell in terms of public service yes  ,  because\nyou feel like you 're giving so much of your time and effort and you don't\nexpect anything from them\n\n\nSometimes you 're not even appreciated but you have to get used to\nthe job that it 's really like that\n\n\nThat 's how life is\n\n\nIt 's more of how were you when you wanted to help them or do what\nis expected from you\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh huh   \n\n\nWhat what 's the most serious case that you 've ever handled\noutside of the neighborhood squabbles to date\n\n<$B> \n\nBut you know most of them are some like B P twenty-two it 's\nlike collection of money wherein they didn't their check bounced and they\ndidn't pay so sometimes you know they just need more time for them to settle\nthe problem or their financial situation\n\n\nSome of them involve uh you know like one said this slanderous\nremarks  ,  or there 's a threat by this or that person or acts\nof lasciviousness\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh huh   \n\n\nYes do you uh yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nThere 's also but not that many\n\n<$A> \n\n have you\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat case have you handled which is do you have anything\nhandled anything that 's been like a funny one\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yeah   yeah  \n\n<$A> \n\n Humorous   case\n\n<$B> \n\nThere 's one when it started I think with the feces of a dog\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh and then what happened\n\n\n  What  \n\n<$B> \n\n And   then they started saying something and that 's\nwhen the complication began and so that 's when the fight  ,  \nand the the complaints you know   <unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n<$A> \n\n So   \n\n\nWho sued  whom   \n\n<$B> \n\nUh whoever was the one who said something bad first or someone\nwho uh would fight or have some physical injuries but sometimes it ends they\nend up also charging the other so it 's   like a charge and counter\ncharge  \n\n<$A> \n\n But like about this one about the dog   \n\n<$B> \n\nUh what about the\n\n<$A> \n\nThe owner charge   was  charged\n\n<$B> \n\n No   the one when they were mentioning about the\ndog uh and somebody and the neighbor who owns the dog said something bad so\nthe one who  who was the recipient would be the one to complain\n\n<$A> \n\nSo this is   what  a slander case\n\n<$B> \n\n And   uh sometimes threats\n\n<$A> \n\n  Uh huh  \n\n<$B> \n\n Including    uh oral defamation and\nthen I was some that 's why I would kinda I would find it funny because\nimagine it started just with the feces of a dog and then funny is I had\nanother court I had to appear in another court as a trouble-shooter 'cause\nthe regular lawyer wasn't around and it was also about the feces of a dog\n\n\nSo I  I I felt what 's this\n\n\nIs this a common thing\n\n\nFor this kind of people always about dogs\n\n\nUh hum so I said    ano ba   \n\n<$A> \n\n So   how was this case uh   finally settled\n\n \n\n<$B> \n\n Well I dunno   \n\n\nThe other one\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you win it\n\n<$B> \n\nNo the other one I I was just there for the I think for the\ncross-examination which I did not even know about because I was just\ntrouble-shooting but I was forced by the judge to continue\n\n\nI dunno what happened but the one I 'm handling I entered into the\npicture I think it started already but since I 'm now assigned with that\ncourt I have to continue with uh I still have to present another witness\nwhich is the husband  \n\n<$A> \n\n Teka muna  what do you think of Kris Aquino\nand her new problem  with this new married man in\nher life\n\n<$B> \n\n Ay naku  she has her own way of thinking\n\n\n Ay  we I can't say you know it 's hard to judge\nespecially when it comes to the heart\n\n<$A> \n\nBut what was your reaction\n\n\nMe I had an initial reaction which was this Kris  talaga\n\n she always gets in trouble with the same kind of trouble falls in\nlove with a man she really couldn't have\n\n<$B> \n\n E  but   what can you\ndo about it\n\n\nI mean you know they 're just what if she really fell in love\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah but I think I think there are a lot of other eligible\nmen but uh I think I think she really is specifically drawn to these men who\nare married and  ,  and are hard just just hard to it 's a\nrelationship that 's really full of problems to begin with  , \n\n troublesome relationship\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh huh   \n\n\n Uh huh   \n\n\nUh huh\n\n<$A> \n\nI think because remember with uh Philip I  they\nhad the same problem\n\n<$B> \n\n  Yeah right yes  \n\n<$A> \n\n With Philip Salvador   and even if this thing\ngets settled if they do get annulled the situation is just so complicated\nbecause Joey has children of his own and children with other women  pa\n\n aside from Alma\n\n<$B> \n\nWell that 's true but at this point for me maybe because of\nhow we see other people what would make them happy sad or what they want I\nguess when it comes to the heart  ,  it 's hard to judge\n\n\nThat 's the safest answer yes but it 's hard to judge\n\n\nI mean you can't say when someone falls in love  di ba\n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh huh   \n\n\nThat 's true yeah well that 's true that 's true  \n\n<$B> \n\n Okay\n\n<$A> \n\nNo but at least in my case in my case uh the reason why I 'm\nsticking with it and I 'm actually fighting for it is because he 's my\nhusband and I know that everything is right and it would work out eventually\nin the end\n\n<$B> \n\nYes it   will  \n\n<$A> \n\n But   in Kris 's case I think she 's I don't know\nuh, she 's very intelligent it 's such a waste  di ba  \n\n\nIt 's just such a waste\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen people expect much from her\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nEspecially with her family background or her position now in\nshowbiz and she 's very influential and then in comparison to maybe the guy\nwho is a womanizer probably or what but still I have that same opinion when\nyou cannot say and judge when it comes to the heart  ,  \nespecially with love\n\n<$A> \n\n There 's this   \n\n\n  There 's this  \n\n<$B> \n\n You   can't say\n\n\nWe don't know also Joey that well maybe who knows there must be\nsomething in him that Kris might have seen which we didn't know or have seen\nthat made her feel like loving him\n\n\nI dunno I don't know him\n\n<$A> \n\nBut but I you know I tend to think that it 's more of like a\nrebound thing for for Joey\n\n<$B> \n\nFor Joey\n\n<$A> \n\nFor Joey because he has just had a he was just uh had this\nmarital problem with Alma and uh he was just working on his that 's uh that 's\nthe very reason why they they got to meet in the first place because\n\n<$B> \n\nFor the interview I think\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah for the interview\n\n<$B> \n\n Oo  \n\n<$A> \n\nSo if you think about it I don't think it has already been a\nyear and suddenly he finds himself  falling in love again\n\n<$B> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd he hasn't even resolved his problem with Alma Moreno\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's right that 's right\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I think there 's also this element of uh being on the\nrebound on Joey 's side\n\n<$B> \n\nOn Joey not on Kris 's side\n\n<$A> \n\nNo because she hasn't been in a relationship I think\n\n<$B> \n\nFor how many years\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nWell\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's very strange because the the profile of these two\ngentlemen more or less the same  still married and\nworking on the annulment\n\n<$B> \n\nUh huh that 's true\n\n\nThat 's true\n\n\nBut uh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd it 's such a shame because she 's the daughter of Ninoy\nAquino\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe that 's it  e  \n\n\nThey expected so much more from her and to think with her position\nI 'm sure there 'll be other eligible wonderful men who would want to be\nthere for her but we dunno she 's the one who 's gonna decide on her on who\nshe wants to love so we 'll see\n\n\nWe don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's just too bad that 's she 's in the limelight\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah that 's why it 's more pronounced and talked about\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay yeah\n\n<$A> \n\n'cause I was just trying to imagine like what she said she\ntold Joey okay just between the two of us we have we have a dozen kids\nalready\n\n<$B> \n\n Ha  \n\n<$A> \n\n she has she has her Joshua\n\n<$B> \n\nOh okay that 's   one  \n\n<$A> \n\n And   then Joey has his own kids with Alma and\nthe other kids that he has with these other women\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nSo between the two of them probably Joey has eleven\naltogether plus Kris 's Joshua so they will have twelve kids\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd\n\n<$A> \n\nSo and if they have kids of their own  pa  \nthen that would be really really complicated\n\n<$B> \n\nWell there are other men before Joey who also had that kind\nof situation with many children hmmm but uh well it 's up to them  , \n\n really\n\n<$A> \n\n  Oo    \n\n<$B> \n\nWhat would make people happy anyway\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n\nYou know there 's this uh there 's this uh quotation that\nsometimes I used to think  about it a lot\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich is\n\n<$A> \n\nUh, which is it goes something like  The heart has\nits reasons that the mind cannot understand  \n\n\nAnd I used to think about that a lot especially when I think about\nmy own relationship and I think that explains that that explains uh Kris 's\nsituation right now\n\n<$B> \n\nCan you elaborate\n\n<$A> \n\nLike you know you get into you you get into uh all if you 're\nvery much in love with this person you 'll defy everything and uh even if it 's\njust a even if it 's a you-and-me-against-the-world situation\n\n<$B> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$A> \n\nYou still go on with it and try to fight for it\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause is it possible because the heart says so because you\nlove the person so much\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo nga  and you don't think rationally\nanymore\n\n<$B> \n\nSo could it be it doesn't mean it 's right\n\n\nSomething like that\n\n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no\n\n\nIt 's actually it 's it 's uh trying what it 's trying to say I\nthink is that uh a person in love can do the craziest things foolish things\nin fact so\n\n<$B> \n\nFor the person\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nFor that person\n\n<$A> \n\nFor the love for the love\n\n<$B> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo it 's the heart working but if the person doesn't stop to\nthink about the consequences  ,  and the bad uh the bad things\nthat she that uh might happen because you 're entering into this complicated\nrelationship\n\n\nI used to think about that a lot but that was before\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh huh   \n\n\nAnd now what do you think about that quotation\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't think too much about it anymore because uh I don't\nknow I 've found some uh I think I think what I am fighting for now is not\njust because I 'm crazy about this person but because I 'm married and\neverything is legal anyway\n\n<$B> \n\n  Uh huh  \n\n<$A> \n\n You know   so unlike in cases like this in cases\nlike this  ,  everything 's just wrong wrong wrong\n\n\nIn my case morally there 's no problem\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh huh   \n\n\nYou 're supposed to be together to   start with  uh huh\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   so I don't think about that but when I was\nyounger and I was involved in questionable relationships  then I used to hang on to that quotation\n\n<$B> \n\nUh huh because you loved that person even if the legal  \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nOr whatever consequence\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah yeah yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nWell but you know it 's sometimes we just have to let go and\nfeel our emotions to know what life is also\n\n\nDidn't they say was that in the \" Moulin Rouge \" \nthat uh the best or is it the best achievement or what is in life is to love\nand be loved in return\n\n\nAlthough I know we shouldn't be hurting other people but uh I\nstill cannot say much about that because it 's so hard when you 're really in\nlove you 'll never even whatever consequence or true\nyou-and-me-against-the-world  ,  you 'll love that person truly\nwith all your heart\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh  1 1 1", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "946b3d93-282a-4b25-b279-02d72421859b", "added":

 dizzy  \n\n<$A> \n\n <unclear> word </unclear> before   or\n\n<$B> \n\nShe thought that she felt dizzy and then she asked us did did you feel that \n\n\nMore or like we we kinda realized it after she asked us  e  \n\n\nAnd it was like it lasted for about a minute \n\n<$A> \n\nA   minute   \n\n<$B> \n\nA  minute   \n\n\nIt was really long but it it it wasn't really that strong  e  \n\n\nIt was kinda you know when you 're kinda drunk   and  and you can't get your footing right\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you kinda sway\n\n\nThat 's how it felt but we were sitting down then and also it felt like somebody was shaking your chair your desk\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat time was this because I didn't go to school so I didn't feel it\n\n\nI didn't feel it in Para&ntilde;aque \n\n<$B> \n\nUhm I think it was around nine thirty to ten something like early in the morning\n\n<$A> \n\nEarly\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then what happened\n\n\nDid anybody panic or   whatever  \n\n<$B> \n\n No   nothing\n\n\nShe was she our teacher just said  na  uhm it 's about time 'cause it hit like I don't know Japan or Korea twice already so it was a   matter of time  \n\n<$A> \n\n I think it was   Japan\n\n<$B> \n\nJapan right\n\n\nSo she was like why be surprised \n\n\nIt 's a you know it 's\n\n<$A> \n\n  It 's a natural  phenomenon\n\n<$B> \n\n It 's inevitable   because it 's hitting everything around us\n\n\nWhy won't it hit us, \n\n\nSo there but it was nothing like the one in uhm, uh when was that\n\n<$A> \n\nGatecrasher\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah during the Gatecrasher a few months\n\n<$A> \n\nLast summer\n\n<$B> \n\nLast summer  ba 'yon  \n\n<$A> \n\nWhat month was that I forgot I totally forgot,   no  \n\n<$B> \n\n Not   last summer early this year\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I

strong\n\n<$A> \n\nI know it was so strong because I was in bed\n\n\nIt was like two in the morning\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah it was at two\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then I woke up because I thought I thought I was dreaming I thought I was dreaming and then I was getting dizzy and then when I woke up my fan was shaking my whole bed was shaking as in the whole fan was swaying left to right and then\n\n<$B> \n\nYou think it was gonna fall like that\n\n<$A> \n\nIt wasn't it didn't look like it was gonna fall but it was really shaking and my my fan had wheels so   so  \n\n<$B> \n\n  Oh  my God\n\n<$A> \n\nIt was really shaking and my bed was made of  narra  \n\n\nCan you imagine it 's shaking like hell and I woke up and I was so scared\n\n<$B> \n\nYou didn't hear like things fall down like you know\n\n<$A> \n\nNo but I heard my the the light the chandelier\n\n<$B> \n\nDownstairs\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah it was really loud\n\n<$B> \n\nIt was swaying\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm,   and  then there\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nThere  kasi  in  ano  we were in uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nMakati\n\n<$B> \n\nMakati in that in that Club Fun thing\n\n<$A> \n\nGlorietta\n\n<$B> \n\nGlorietta\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWhere that party was 'cause of that Gatecrasher came here right\n\n\nSo there was a big party a D J party, so  ang daming tao  and then all I thought we were staying by like a few steps by the D J 's booth and what separated the D J 's booth from the dance floor was like a ledge right\n\n\nAnd it was like maybe a foot wide and I saw  kasi  people uhm would put their glasses and their bottles on top of the ledge so what I did was I was going down the steps\n\n\nIt was like  mga  around two three feet away and right when I reached my hand up 'cause I wanna push back the bottles and the glasses 'cause people kept on bumping into the ledge I was gonna push them back and all of a sudden before you know nobody hit the ledge but the bottles kinda tipped over right into it fell into my hand\n\n\nSo and that 's when I felt swaying like really  lakas  really strong\n\n\nI swayed back and forth\n\n\nEven the D J was like what the hell is going on \n\n\nEverybody was swaying \n\n<$A> \n\n Some of my friends thought it was the effects of the place of the club\n\n\nYeah  because everybody was high everybody was on whatever \n\n<$B> \n\n of that\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd people it was it was it was as strong as it was like the tide that you could get knocked off your feet  ,  if you were like uh unsteady or something\n\n\nIt 's really strong I had to I had to hold on to my friend\n\n\nWe were hugging each other 'cause it it was like  ang lakas grabe , \n\n\nSo there and the thing is you know after that right after it happened, uhm my boy friend and I was let 's go let 's get out of here because aftershocks  daw  are   strong  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Are worse   \n\n<$B> \n\nAre worse so you we had to get out of the building\n\n\nWe couldn't take the elevator because we know it 's stupid\n\n\nSo we went to the parking lot and uh\n\n<$A> \n\nTook the stairs\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd took the stairs and a lot of people were going out but the thing is like maybe half of the people were still stayed in there\n\n\nThey were still partying and the D J just kept on going\n\n\nHe 's like what am I gonna to continue or and everybody was cheering and okay we 'll continue \n\n\nThey started playing and then everybody was there shouting you know, it was kinda\n\n<$A> \n\nStupid\n\n<$B> \n\nStupid because you know  di ba  \n\n<$A> \n\nPeople don't realize that things like that happen for a reason\n\n\nIt 's not just\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah exactly and they didn't kinda piece it together that you know earthquakes have been happening in first in Turkey and I don't know where else but it was  sunod-sunod  right\n\n\nIt was right one after\n\n<$A> \n\nSigns in signs of the coming of the end of the world\n\n<$B> \n\nI know it said in the Bible and these people aren't even scared I mean  di ba  I was telling you before, it was like the perfect setting for it to happen\n\n\nI wasn't even surprised that it happened because you 're here amidst all these people who are high on something or drunk or whatever and it 's kinda like that image when uhm, uh when when people are\n\n<$A> \n\n Parang  they turned in salt, from the Bible, what was that\n\n<$B> \n\nNo the one where they were uhm they were like worshipping that golden cow or something that they have made\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yeah yeah yeah and when you look back the the person who looks back will turn into salt\n\n<$B> \n\nUh that 's the one\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm that 's it\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so it was kinda like that I I kinda   parang  I pictured in my head  na  this is the scene from the Bible only we 're

hedonistic whatever\n\n\nAnd it was like that earthquake was kinda like the Lord 's voice from above\n\n\nRemember when  di ba  in the Bible it says uhm there 's a loud voice from above or something like that\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm, that was so that was so scary\n\n\nI was so scared and\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat did you do\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm when I woke up I wasn't even sure because I was I was sitting on the

some of them were even wearing robes\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause they were so scared\n\n<$B> \n\nIn the hotel in Hotel uhm   I think  \n\n<$A> \n\n Nikko   \n\n<$B> \n\nNikko  ba yon  \n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know, somewhere there in Glorietta\n\n<$B> \n\nOr New World or something like that  basta  the one that 's  malapit  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm the security made everybody get out of the room Intercon I think Intercon something I don't I forgot what what uhm hotel it was\n\n\nAnd then everybody was going out but we had to pee so we had to go in and go to the bathroom and then right away they they told us to leave to get out and there were security all over\n\n\nI guess there were some important persons there\n\n<$A> \n\n Grabe 'no  \n\n\nThe signs are everywhere but then\n\n<$B> \n\nI know\n\n<$A> \n\nEverybody just goes on with their lives and not thinking of what may happen in the future\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's more of like they 're brushing it aside   they don't  they don't  di ba  they don't wanna deal with it\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm that 's it   \n\n<$B> \n\nThey don't wanna think about it\n\n\nThey don't wanna feel scared\n\n<$A> \n\nSometimes when I tell my friend when I tell them like I feel like it 's going to be the end of the world soon they 're like can you not talk like that \n\n<$B> \n\nExactly they don't wanna\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's true it 's gonna happen soon so why not face it while and be ready when it comes\n\n<$B> \n\nExactly\n\n\nBut they don't wanna face it\n\n\nThey wanna go on and do whatever they 've been doing\n\n\nThey don't want the reality of God 's power to to kinda rain on their parade kinda thing\n\n\nThey wanna enjoy they wanna do what they want\n\n\nThey don't wanna have to uhm you know  \n\n\nThey don't wanna deal with their conscience\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n Di ba  \n\n<$A> \n\n'Cause they know things are really going bad and and they 're not doing anything about it and, sometimes they 're just not really interested anymore\n\n<$B> \n\nExactly\n\n\nIt it 's like they don't wanna feel anything  di ba  \n\n\nIt 's sad  e , \n\n<$A> \n\nPeople are so uhm apathetic\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n\nEspecially here in the Philippines I 've noticed that and and it 's ironic  kasi  here everybody is supposed to be so Catholic and so Christian and blah blah blah blah blah\n\n\nBut look what they 're doing they 're not doing anything\n\n<$A> \n\nBut sometimes it 's extremes some are really religious and and you know God-fearing and whatever and some are they just don't care as long as they have the pleasures of life they they they have they have uhm they have money they have whatever they can get everything is fine as long as they 're living a a normal and and, what\n\n<$B> \n\nWell that 's what I 'm saying  kanina  like\nthey 're worshipping the wrong things like what you said perhaps people are happy that they have uh a good home they have money to buy food they have money to buy clothes  ganyan

{"text": "<$A> \nUh so the term is over\n\n<$B> \nYeah\n\n<$A> \nWhat are your plans for this summer\n\n<$B> \nYeah this coming April nineteen I 'll teach because \nuh I 'm given loads by by C S B\n\n\nI 'm given World Literature at the same time Creative \nWriting\n\n\nI shall be teaching one subject in the morning and then \none in the afternoon\n\n\nActually actually the subjects uh should start at eight \no'clock in the morning  ,  until twelve ten but then I think \nthere 's one English teacher who would like to teach in the morning because she \n's pregnant and then she would like to go home   in the  afternoon \nto Bulacan\n\n<$A> \n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm  \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \nUh so she asked me if we can swap and then I gave \nthe subjects one subject to her the the one in the morning so, my schedule is \nreally tough in the sense that I don't like actually the schedule because  \n one is in  the morning and one is   in the afternoon \n\n<$A> \n Uh uhm yes  \n\n\n In the afternoon   uh uhm\n\n<$B> \nSo that 's it I 'll be teaching from April \nnineteen up to May, May twelve\n\n<$A> \nThat is oh   less than a month \n\n<$B> \n  Three weeks  \n\n<$A> \nYeah   three weeks \n\n<$B> \n Three weeks  \n\n<$A> \nWell anyway uh that 's uh how how generous you are \n  really  'no  \n\n<$B> \n That 's right   that 's the policy of \nthe school because if you are a full-load teacher uh I think that 's only in C S \nB because in the main I think we have only part-time and full-time\n\n<$A> \nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \nPart-time and full-time but in C S B I think we \nhave something in the middle like full-load\n\n\nUh the full-load enjoys also what a full-time teacher \nenjoys but then what 's the difference\n\n\nThe difference lies in uh in one thing when summer \ncomes a full-time teacher doesn't teach but then he gets a salary\n\n\nA full-load doesn't get a salary he has to teach\n\n<$A> \nYeah yeah yeah\n\n<$B> \nAnd then another advantage of a full-load uhm, \ncompared with  ano  compared with full with a part-time\n\n<$A> \nWith a part-time\n\n<$B> \nIs that uh, a full-load is given I think an \neighteen unit eighteen units eighteen unit load plus three units\n\n\nA part-time can only have up to fifteen units something \nlike that\n\n<$A> \nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \nSo of course the salary is higher\n\n\nIn terms of salary the salary of a full-time and then a \nfull-load uh teacher, between a full-load and uh full-load   and a  \nfull-time the salary is the same\n\n<$A> \n Full-time  \n\nOh the same\n\n<$B> \nThe salary is the same\n\n\nUh, the difference lies in the number of years of \nteaching at the same time the qualification academic qualification\n\n\nSay if you have a P H D of course you get a higher \nsalary and then if you have stayed in C S B for a number of years then you get \nalso a higher salary\n\n<$A> \nWhen when does one become a full uh full-time \n\n<$B> \nA full-time it depends on you know the Coordinator \nthe what do you call it the Chairperson and then there 's another one the \nDirector\n\n<$A> \nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \nSo the three of them decide and then everything \ndepends on one important thing and that is attitude\n\n\nEven though you are a good teacher  ,  \nand then your academic credentials are really very good  ,  if \nuh you know you don't \n\n<$A> \n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nYour attitude is\n\n<$B> \nYou don't you don't follow the C S B mission we \n're talking about attitude\n\n<$A> \nUh uhm   uh uhm \n\n<$B> \n You know   so, you can never be a \nfull-time teacher a full-load teacher\n\n<$A> \n  So you 're now \n\n<$B> \n So they look into   that\n\n<$A> \nSo you 're now a full-load teacher\n\n<$B> \nA full-load after, two terms because in the \nfirst term, this is my first year actually in C S B\n\n\nIn the first term I was a full I was a part-time \nteacher\n\n<$A> \nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \nAnd then in the second term I was a part-time \nteacher because at the same time I was teaching at University of the East  \n,  because I was invited to teach there \n\n<$A> \n Uhm   \n\n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \nSo the Director told me why don't you give it up \n  and then  the second term we 'll give you a full-load status \n\n<$A> \n Uhm  \n\n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \nI I told them to give it up but then, I think \nthe classes ended uh last last October for   the first  semester \n<,> and then our second trimester started in  ,  September \n\n<$A> \n Uh uhm  \n\n\n September   \n\n<$B> \nSo they cannot they were they were not able to \ngrant me the full-load\n\n<$A> \n  Uh uhm \n\n<$B> \n So   they told me you really have to \nwait for the third term  ,  because uh we would like to be sure \nthat you you would give up University of the East  ,  so that we \ncan grant you a full-load because that I think that 's the agreement so I was \ngiven the full-load in the third trimester \n\n<$A> \n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \nThird trimester and then they are planning to give \nuh teachers who are full-load uh a full-time status this   coming  \nJune\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   this coming June\n\n<$B> \nYeah because according to yeah because according \nto the President Brother Dizon there 's no such thing as   as full-  \nload\n\n<$A> \n Full-load   \n\n<$B> \nAs far as status is concerned   we have \n only part-time and   full-time  where did you get this full-\nload   something  like that \n\n<$A> \n Yeah  \n\n\n Full-time  \n\n\n Uh uhm  \n\n\nOh yeah  oo nga  \n\n<$B> \nSo he was questioning that when he he went to C S \nB because he goes there every Wednesday\n\n\nAnd he was questioning Dean Reyes and the E V P where \ndid you get that  full-load   I mean   did Andrew Gonzalez know \nabout this \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \nWhy is it that it 's like this if you follow the \nLa Salle system  ,  when you talk about the university\n\n<$A> \n Uh uhm   \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \nSo, as part of PAASCU accreditation which will \nbe this coming July then they have to convert these full-loaders into full-time\n\n<$A> \nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \nUh\n\n<$A> \nUh one hundred percent\n\n<$B> \nNo they \u0091re still looking into   \npossibilities  because there are some teachers who are not you know in \nterms   of  attitude\n\n<$A> \n The attitude  \n\n\n Yes  \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \nThey \u0091re not worthy to be given the status  \n,  something like that \n\n<$A> \n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \nBecause the school is very careful in granting \nthe full-time status to teachers\n\n\nBecause now in School of Multidisciplinary Studies uh \nout of one hundred thirty teachers we 're talking about basic subjects English \nMath uh Filipino Social Studies all these teachers uhm belong to School of \nMultidisciplinary Studies\n\n\nUh we call it now as General Education program\n\n\nAnd then we have also another department like \nManagement something like that\n\n\nSo the biggest department in C S B is the School of \nMultidisciplinary Studies\n\n\nSo out of one one hundred thirty teachers we have only \nfull-time is four full-time teachers and all of these have problems with \nattitude\n\n<$A> \nUhm\n\n<$B> \nSo the school has really difficult time   \nhow  thinking how to get rid of these four people but we cannot because they \ncannot because they 're full-time  ,  something like that \n\n<$A> \n Yeah  \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \nSo when the school grants a full-time status to \nthese teachers who have full-load status they are, they 're very careful with \nthat\n\n<$A> \nUh-huh, those schools there you have a full-\ntime uh faculty uh that uh who are not yet, permanent\n\n<$B> \nUh, those full-time faculty those four full-\ntime faculty members are permanent already\n\n<$A> \nPermanent already\n\n<$B> \n Oo  they \u0091re permanent already\n\n<$A> \nWhat attitudes for instance,\n\n<$B> \nOne is the Faculty Association President but then \nit seems that he doesn't he doesn't uh, he doesn't protect the interest of \nthe faculty like take for example during the promotion the promotion uh the \nmeeting of the board for the promotion of teachers\n\n<$A> \nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \nHe always goes against these teachers who are \npromoted like for example\n\n<$A> \nUhm\n\n<$B> \nI was nominated   before  to be \npromoted to be given the full-load status together with other four English \nteachers, he questioned that, I mean you are a faculty president\n\n<$A> \n Uh uhm   \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \nFaculty Association President you should you \nshould protect the interest of the faculty you should defend   your  \nsupport the the faculty members for promotion  ,  why is it that \nyou are like that \n\n<$A> \n Support  \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \nSo people  I mean teachers were \nactually questioning him why is it that it 's like that \n\n\nAt the same time other four full-time uh faculty \nteachers who are  who are also officers of the Faculty Association\n\n<$A> \nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \nAnd every time every time the school decides oh \nthe plan is like this the plan is like that  ,  they always go \nagainst with the plan \n\n<$A> \n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \nSo\n\n<$A> \nAnd why like that\n\n<$B> \nThe school cannot remove them the the school \ncan't get rid of them because they 're permanent\n\n<$A> \nYeah\n\n<$B> \nSo\n\n<$A> \nVery   difficult  'no  \n\n<$B> \n So   I think last month uh there was \na news that that they would like to go to United States as tourists something \nlike that\n\n<$A> \nThat \u0091s the President\n\n<$B> \nThe four of them the four of them\n\n<$A> \nWait a minute\n\n\nAre they all officers wait are they <unclear> word \n</unclear>\n\n<$B> \nThey are all officers of the Faculty Association\n\n<$A> \nOh\n\n<$B> \n Oo  something like that one is \npresident the other is secretary\n\n<$A> \nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \nBecause uh I think the policy the policy in the \nthe Faculty Association is that you cannot become a president you should be a \nfull-time faculty in order to become a president if you want to hold a major \nposition like secretary auditor\n\n\nSo you should be a full-time teacher\n\n\nSo the positions they they get all the positions,\n\n\nSo I think they feel that the school doesn't like them\n\n<$A> \nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \nAnd then many last month many were applying for \nabroad\n\n<$A> \nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \nSo uh they asked for what do you call this they \nasked for certification what do you call that certification of employment that \nthey are permanent teachers at C S B so   that  when you present this \npaper to the Embassy you will be granted the visa tourist visa\n\n<$A> \n Uh uhm  \n\n<$B> \n\nBecause if you are permanent in a certain school \nlike for example C S B or any private schools  ,   \n\n<$A> \n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \nThen you will come back, because you are  \n permanent  \n\n<$A> \n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \nBecause you may you really have to serve the \nschool   something  like that \n\n So they asked for that and then Dr Reyes said why not give \nthem the letters they like I mean they want whatever letters they they want so \nthat they can go out of school because we know that they will not come back \nanymore because that 's United States of America  ,   \n\n And that the purpose of going there is not only to to see \nAmerica but to stay there and work \n\n\nThat 's one way T N T  so when the Dean heard that from the Human \nResource Management uh in-charge and then she told she told him give them the \nletter \n\n<$A> \n Uh uhm  \n\n\n And then   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\nAnd then, let them go\n\n<$B> \nLet them go if they will not come back then that \n's okay\n\n<$A> \nWhen are they planning to go\n\n<$B> \nBut we heard that uh the visa was not approved\n\n\nThey were not granted visa because it \u0091s difficult to \ngo to the United States right now because of the V F A because of the V F A,\n\n\nSo that 's that 's life in C S B, so   I 'll \nbe teaching \n\n<$A> \n Usually   how long does it does it \ntake for a full-loader  'no  a full-load faculty to become a \nfull-time\n\n<$B> \nFull-time uh usually one year\n\n\nUh the reason why they were questioning us the four of \nus uh the four of us from the English Department because this is our first year\n\n\nI mean if you are a new teacher you have to wait for \none year you have to finish your one year and then you 'll be granted the full-\nload status\n\n\nBut why is it that after after the first trimester why \nis it the school was eager to to give us the status\n\n\nBecause in preparation for the PAASCU that was the \nreason\n\n\nAnd then they see they saw that time that we deserved \nto be to be given the the status it was not stated in the faculty manual \nactually but uh but they claimed that why is it that in our case before I mean \nwe waited for two years three years and then we were granted the full-time and \nfull-load status why is it that these new teachers are are are given the the \nstatus it 's uh unfair on the part of those who have stayed here for a number of \nyears \n\n\nSo they were questioning that but then they cannot do \nanything at all because uh the school decided for that", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f9febbb5-5142-4582-8c01-864cde4daaf3", "added":

then which is an orphanage for uhm street boys\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then I worked with my Dad part-time from nineteen, eighty-four I think it was, until I graduated\n\n\nWhen I graduated actually before I graduated I was supposed to go abroad but the government withheld my passport\n\n\nSo since I couldn't travel uhm and I graduated Mass Com my Dad asked me to work with him rather than to work for the government\n\n\n  Because if you 're  in broadcasting you work with the government you have no choice\n\n\nSo I said sure for a while and I ended up working with him for something like fourteen years before he died \n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh so but I was also I was doing a lot of crazy things like I was teaching in U S T\n\n\nI was teaching in Assumption\n\n\nI was not a very good teacher  \n\n\nI have no patience\n\n\nUh and I used to dub you know those Japanese cartoons  ,  as in Voltes Five \n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\n Oo  \n\n<$B> \n\nOkay but I was not in Voltes Five I was in the cartoon called Grendaizer\n\n\nSo I would dub I 'd be a voice talent uh part-time\n\n\n Pero  I was  nga  holding down about four jobs all at the same time\n\n\nI was teaching in U S T uhm twenty-one units\n\n\nI was teaching in Assumption no U S T I think  in Assumption something like eighteen or twenty-one units  ,  and then I was uh dubbing and then I was working for my Dad\n\n\nAll at the same time \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nAll at the same time\n\n<$B> \n\nThis lasted for about a year\n\n\nAnd then after that I went full-time already with my Dad\n\n\nSo I used actually uhm I 'm now connected with FLAG\n\n\nAt that time I was helping him out with FLAG uh but let me see I started out with my Dad as the receptionist and then the clerk typist librarian uh bookkeeper accountant\n\n\nI went around 'till I became his secretary\n\n\nAnd then eventually I managed his firm\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo I started from the bottom up\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nThere  \n\n\nNumber six\n\n<$A> \n\nNumber six\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nUh here uh number six\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay I have a son I am not married\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B>

be the favorite until my son came along\n\n\nWhen my son came along there was no more favorite except my son\n\n\nHe was the one who would accompany my Dad everywhere\n\n\nHe had a desk in my Dad 's office which you know kind of wasn't allowed\n\n\nUh but he was the only one\n\n\nHe would he he and Dad were very close\n\n\nThey were  talagang,   \n\n\nNow he is eleven\n\n<$A> \n\nSo when your Dad

really took it very badly because he viewed my father I would say uhm not so much as a  lolo  I mean both as a  lolo  because he was spoiled rotten really  \n\n\nUh but also he but my Dad was his father image\n\n\nThat was his concept\n\n\nSo when my Dad died he he he he his studies were you know he just didn't wanna study anymore\n\n\nHe he he was really of  I think  'no  \n\n\nUhm let me put it this way\n\n\nI could not grieve as much because I had to look after him  ,  because he was the one who really really really I mean \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nHe took it badly\n\n<$B> \n\nHe he really did\n\n\nHe he took it badly <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n\nHe couldn't sleep he wouldn't eat you know that type \n\n\n Siya talaga 'yung naapektuhan  so I was affected but I couldn't  because I had   to  attend to my son\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nWell anyway so, you remember your Dad before he was into politics\n\n\n  Do you remember that time  \n\n<$B> \n\n As a kid   I used to work for him all the time\n\n\nYou see my Dad was more my boss\n\n\nHe and I had a very good relationship but I would say that I knew him very well as a   boss  uhm because I worked for him \n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\nSo what was his personality\n\n\nWhat what   kind of a person  \n\n<$B> \n\n He was   a perfectionist\n\n\nOkay I\n\n<$A> \n\nYet I heard he always did things last minute\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but he was a perfectionist   in this  sense  ha  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\nThere 's a pleading\n\n\nUh he he does not like Touch and Go  \n\n\nAt that time there were no computers\n\n\nSo I could not submit anything to him that had an erasure because he didn't like it  ,  he was he was that much\n\n\nHe was also what he demanded of himself he demanded of us\n\n\nUh so he demanded he had very very high standards in everything he did\n\n\nHe felt that if you do something you do it well or you don't do it at all period\n\n\nAnd that was what he imposed on himself that 's what he imposed on us\n\n\nHe also, was uh I don't know a very responsible person uh in this sense  'no  like for example we the staff I mean I would make him laugh with booboos\n\n\nBut in front of the client he would protect us\n\n\nHe he would you know but in front of when it was us he would bawl us out  ,  why did you do that\n\n\nYou were so stupid ta tah ta tah ta tah\n\n\nI mean he had no compunctions about that\n\n\nUh what kind of a person was he\n\n\nHe was also  ano  he loved books, and huh he used to say  ale mahal  instead of Ali Mall\n\n\nThat will that was our joke all the time\n\n\nOkay he would go around with us  \n\n\nSeveral times I used to accompany him to his hearings\n\n\nHe would forget that I was with him  \n\n\nHe would leave me and it 's up to me to go home\n\n\nI don't even know where I am and it 's up to me to go home\n\n\nBecause he had so many things in his head\n\n<$A> \n\n Ah yeah  ha    \n\n \n\n\nUh he 's always thinking so he\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I thought yeah he was thinking\n\n\nUhm and  and then uhm no okay he loved crossword puzzles\n\n\nHe he would do that a lot of times\n\n\nUh, what else would we do\n\n\n Ano rin siya  he was very, uhm  cari&ntilde;oso  \n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh he would always make  akbay  he would always put his arm around you\n\n\nHe was not uh he was not  ano  I mean at least with us  'no  with us kids very  cari&ntilde;oso  \n\n\nAnd then, uhm, I don't think he had much of a sense of humor\n\n\nBut we would laugh all the time and he wouldn't find it funny\n\n\nI mean okay there were things he wouldn't find funny of course  'no  \n\n\nI mean uh but, not my sense of humor\n\n\nHe was more serious than most\n\n\nUh he what was his  what else was he like, you know  basta  he was a tough boss\n\n\nHe he would he was a difficult person for me  'no  \n\n\nHe was very challenging to work with\n\n\nBut he was and the thing about okay there are a lot of things I like\n\n\nHe accepted a lot of criticism, for someone  'no  who who writes as well and as intelligent as him\n\n\nFor example he had a talk\n\n\nHe would prepare his talk\n\n\nHe would show it to me announcing you read it you read it\n\n\nTell me what you think \n\n\nHe hated an answer like it 's okay \n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's okay\n\n<$B> \n\nI he hated that\n\n\nUh he encouraged you to argue\n\n\nHe encouraged you to criticize even him and his works\n\n\nAnd I remember doing that and he I remember telling him Papa no I don't think it should be done this way\n\n\nUh I don't think this is correct\n\n\nI don't agree with you \n\n\nYou know etcetera etcetera\n\n\nAnd he said and he argued with me and we really argued\n\n\nAnd then in the end he says okay and he changed it\n\n\nAnd then   I  \n\n<$A> \n\n He was really   open to\n\n<$B> \n\nVery open and he also for his for a man of his stature his brains he was very intelligent he was also quite humble about himself, in that sense\n\n\nBecause very few people   will  take their work their masterpiece   being  criticized\n\n\nHe loved it\n\n\nHe would show me all his papers\n\n\nWhat do you think what do you think about this\n\n\nUh he, he always like for example for me I 've I was never a lawyer\n\n\nHe trained uh with his father right\n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n  Uh uhm  \n\n<$B> \n\n As   a lawyer\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nHe he took up two years of law that 's all if I remember\n\n\nAnd uh his father used to teach him this  trick  and he would do it to everybody all of us at us who worked with him\n\n\nHis father would tell him read this \n\n\nHe would read it and he would go back to his father and he 'd say I 'm through and his father would say okay read something else \n\n\nAnd he asked won't you ask me questions about what I read \n\n\nNo you said you read it I trust you I imagine you understand it if you don't understand it you ask if you don't if you understand it then fine read something else \n\n\nIt stuck with him uhm and the other thing that his father taught him was how to research\n\n\nSo if I asked him any question he would say you have eyes you have a brain God gave them to you go to the library look for whatever it is you 're looking for read it look for it \n\n\nWhen we were really stuck then I 'd go to him like sorry can't find it etcetera etcetera\n\n\n Hay  then he 'd sit down and explain it\n\n\nAnd I I never studied law\n\n\nI worked with him but towards I would say uh the eighties already\n\n\nWe would sit down and discuss his cases and I would ask him Papa can't you do it this way and he 'd say no you see because if you do it if you handle a case in this way this is what 's gonna happen but if we do it another way it 's fine \n\n\nSo he didn't mind\n\n\nHe never made me or any other person feel stupid\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYou could ask a lot of questions and he would take be patient enough to answer it at the same time he encourages you uh not always to think the way he wants\n\n\nHe does not and he already he told us me anyway so many times you can't uhm don't believe what I believe because I believe it\n\n\nBelieve what you believe because you believe it\n\n\nI don't expect any of you to follow me or do exactly what I 'm doing or what or what or what  ,  you do it because it 's you because it 's what you want \n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nHe really made us pushed us to be very independent thinkers\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uhm responsible thinkers\n\n\nI don't know how else\n\n\nBefore before that so I was I 'm one of the younger ones", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nSo can you give me a brief account of your, family and educational background\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay uhm, educational background\n\n\nI just finished law school in the States and I passed the Minnesota bar and I trained in the U S\n\n<$A> \n\n  Uh uh  \n\n\nYou 're gonna be working here or\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh,   \n\n\nYeah\n\n\nI 've come back for good  na  \n\n\nAnd I 'm hoping to take the bar again next year for the Philippine Bar after petitioning the Supreme Court 'cause they might not let me take it after a few years there\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uh\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nIn the family I 'm the ninth  ,  <unclear> words </unclear> I was the baby before my nephew came  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n And you are so, you 've been away for how many years\n\n<$B> \n\nThree years\n\n<$A> \n\nThree years, out in Illinois  'no  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah two years in Illinois then I spent my last year in Minnesota\n\n<$A> \n\nUh so, I 'm here to ask you about your Dad\n\n\nI 'm doing it for my thesis\n\n\nSo you 're not working yet  'no  you just finished\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm I 'm, I 'm a researcher at Free Legal Assistance Group the FLAG office\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm since I can't take the bar until next year what <unclear> word </unclear> until I can so I 'm doing legal research for FLAG\n\n<$A> \n\nUh so now you 're you 're a lawyer and your Dad was a lawyer\n\n\nDid he influence you in any way\n\n<$B> \n\nYes  \n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nI think I 've I 've I 'm not sure I wouldn't have been a lawyer if it weren't for Dad\n\n\nI always started out saying no I 'm going to be an artist\n\n\nNo I 'll be an archaeologist\n\n\nI don't want to become a lawyer\n\n\nI always said no I don't wanna be a lawyer\n\n\nAnd, uh it seemed that everywhere I turned it would always end up with me going back in the direction of law school\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd he was a big influence\n\n\nIt was something I knew would make him really happy if I did go to law school\n\n<$A> \n\nDid he ask you did he ask you no\n\n\n  But you  could sense it\n\n<$B> \n\n No   yeah\n\n\nYeah 'cause when I told him that one time that I had decided to okay for sure I 'm going to law school\n\n\nHe was really really uh  that 's good  \n\n\n  That  kind of tone of voice\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh   \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I knew he was really really happy\n\n\nSo that that was the big influence part <unclear> words </unclear> it was nice to make him feel  \n\n\nI felt he he really wanted me to go\n\n\n'Cause I 'm the only girl who 's gone through law   school  although Cookie probably knows more about the law than I do   'cause she worked again with him  practically\n\n\nBut uh I 'm the only one who really went through formal training \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh   \n\n\n Uh-huh yeah   \n\n\nUh so how old were you before you he formally went, into politics that was around nineteen\n\n<$B> \n\nNo, I was born in nineteen sixty-four I think around four years when he was already starting\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you have no memory of him aside outside you know his political life\n\n\nBefore that I mean before he was really into the limelight\n\n\nSo, what do you remember most about him you know his being a family man\n\n\n  Uh  what do you\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh   he was always around to talk to\n\n\nHe liked to read\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm we liked to read the same books   so we read the same books  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\nWe 'd always go to bookstores\n\n<$A> \n\n  He was fond of reading  \n\n<$B> \n\n I think   that was I think our main activity he 'd come up\n\n\nHe was tired of work and I would be home from school he 'd say C 'mon, let 's go to the bookstore \n\n\nSo we 'd all go together and you uh\n\n\nAnd then we 'd be reading the same books\n\n\nSo it would be fun\n\n\nIt could be a family outing\n\n\nAnd when I was a kid he liked to take a lot of photographs\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nThat was one of his major hobbies\n\n\nSo, I have lots of since I was the baby at that time I was one of the favorite subjects  \n\n\nSo if you look at the family albums there 're   lots of pictures  of me\n\n<$A> \n\n Lots of pictures   of you\n\n\nInteresting\n\n\nSo he liked photography  'no  \n\n\nWhat about his uhm, his his what do you call this his writings\n\n\nI know that he, he also liked to write especially during his detention\n\n\n  He liked  to write a lot\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nFor each us like there was a time when he was in solitary confinement and there wasn't anything he could do\n\n\nHe would pray the rosary and he would make a poem\n\n\nAnd that was all\n\n\nI mean he couldn't they weren't allowing him any access to books or the radio or what\n\n\nSo he would just think and he would make a poem\n\n\nAnd then when we finally got to see him about a month after he 'd told us all the poems he 'd memorized them completely\n\n\nAnd he had one for each of us\n\n\nAnd we 've kept all his letters from prison every birthday 'cause he couldn't really buy anything or make any uh buy anything for us\n\n\nHe would either like I have a kit he had this, model of a Cinderella coach\n\n<$A> \n\n  Uh  \n\n<$B> \n\n It   it 's more a pump with uh with water\n\n\nAnd at the background there 's the Cinderella coach\n\n\nAnd those would be his gifts\n\n\nHe 'd make crafts\n\n<$A> \n\nAhh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then always the letters\n\n\nAnd if he couldn't make anything it 'd be one of the roses he grew in his tiny garden and always a letter\n\n<$A> \n\nHow does it affect you personally, 'cause you were very close to him  'no  \n\n\nI think you 're\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I was  \n\n\nYeah I was the baby for awhile until my nephew came  \n\n\nBy that time I was happy not to be the baby because I was in high school already\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut okay good somebody else now\n\n\nUhm, you know the way I thought was really influenced by what he did\n\n\nI only realized it when I got to high school\n\n\n'Cause I would talk about things with my classmates that they never saw\n\n\nAnd we all, when I went to Assumption and it 's true the convent walls are really high\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm  \n\n<$B> \n\nYou, there 's nothing you don't see anything of the outside when you get out of San Lorenzo Village\n\n\nSo you end up thinking yeah this is probably the world\n\n\nSo when I would talk with my friends about what was going on they would say uh yeah uh yeah, that 's interesting\n\n\nBut they never really saw\n\n<$A> \n\nSo he really he really influenced you in thinking  'no   ,  about the world and everything \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nYeah about what was going on\n\n\nThat there was something more than just within the four walls of the house or within the thick walls of the school\n\n\nThere were other people\n\n\nAnd, and that 's why I  I became a lawyer\n\n\nI think it was there is always the desire to serve\n\n\nAnd I saw how much work he did\n\n\nAnd it 's nice to be able to you know help continue what he did\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat about you know when he went into detention\n\n\nAfter that, how would was he changed in any way I mean emotionally aside from physically  ha  \n\n<$B> \n\nIt it was a big change\n\n\n'Cause when he went in nineteen seventy-two I was eight years old and Mom was very worried about the situation\n\n\nSo she pulled us all out of school, except for the ones in college\n\n\nWe all studied at home for two or three years\n\n<$A> \n\nThree years\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah, two years\n\n\nThen I only went back to school in grade four\n\n\nSo, I think I took part of grade two and part of grade three it was Maya who was teaching me 'cause at that time she was getting her education degree  ,  so she would tutor me\n\n\nAnd uhm so it was a big change in our quality of friends\n\n\nAnd there was that thing you know your father is under detention\n\n\nSo it really didn't affect my friends\n\n\nI don't think their parents ever told them, don't play with her or what\n\n\nThere was no change in that\n\n\nBut I just felt that knowing you were you had a different family life, kind of it sets you apart  ,  and the nuns would kind of look out for us \n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I always felt that you know we were always watched wherever  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nThey made sure we were doing okay\n\n\nUhm and 'cause we would also have I think we started having Masses in the house and <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nBut what about his attitude you know\n\n\nWas he, did he feel that he was weaker you know his spirit I mean\n\n\nIt made him go\n\n\nDid it change him in any way\n\n\nHe wanted to to serve for\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah, I think it it really strengthened his resolve to do something\n\n\nBut before that he was really more of a politician, \n\n\nI think I mean this is thinking back\n\n\n'Cause when I was growing up I really didn't think about it that much\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm before I think he was a traditional politician\n\n\nYou know he went to the Senate although he would talk to people and help them as much as he could\n\n\nWhen he got out of prison it was a deeper commitment to really really serve\n\n\nBecause he went through a lot\n\n\nHe wasn't a politician anymore and he didn't have to go to the Senate or what\n\n\nHe really went into lawyering\n\n\nSeriously he would travel all over\n\n\nAnd, for him it was I think, this is what he always said\n\n\nThat he was treated very well, while he was under detention\n\n\nAnd he knew that, other people weren't\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd but for him he I think he really hated the experience of being confined\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd he said if it was that bad for me I was treated pretty well I had my own room they 'd never tortured me\n\n\nWhat about the people who were tortured they couldn't afford legal help \n\n\nAnd that 's what really pushed him to start the Free Legal Assistance Group FLAG and really get into it\n\n<$A> \n\nBut ahmm, what about his family life\n\n\nHe was very busy  'no  after  ,  after this, he always had time for everybody\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nNot as much\n\n\nUhm uh we used to laugh I used to say that I saw more of him when he was in prison than after  \n\n\nBut all of us, I don't know we took it in stride because we all understood I think\n\n\nHe he  he made us understand, which is what, I appreciate it that you know he explained what he was doing\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo we never really resented the fact that he wasn't around\n\n\nAnd when he was around it would always be fun\n\n\nUhm meal times were great you know\n\n\nYou would all sit down\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd we would talk politics\n\n\nWe would talk about what was going on you know\n\n\nIt was a, more than just the \" how was your day \" like that\n\n\nDid you hear about this \n\n\nWhat did you think of that \n\n<$A> \n\nThat was your special time right during meal time\n\n\nProbably you were all together\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah we all liked to eat too  \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd okay so what about family gatherings you know\n\n\nDid you have any reunions or anything\n\n<$B> \n\nAlways birthdays Dad 's birthday   Mom 's birthday  \n\n<$A> \n\n And the whole   family would be there\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n\nAnd Christmas\n\n\n'Cause by that time some were married or some had lived separate <unclear> words </unclear> for a time they 'd live with us\n\n\nMench lived in Bacolod for a while and she had a separate house\n\n\nBut always for birthdays we 'd be together\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what what happened there and what would you do you know\n\n<$B> \n\nUh oh I don't think we ever really had any gathering that was just really family\n\n\nHe had a really public life\n\n\nHe liked people and people really liked him so every time it would be his birthday friends would always drop by\n\n\nAnd it was always like the extended family\n\n\nI mean the only times would really be, I don't think we had any really family gatherings just the family   except  when he was in prison\n\n\nAlways after that it would be a gathering of lots of friends and he 'd just circulate and go on\n\n\nEverybody would just be talking\n\n\nUhm the kids by that time we had escaped  \n\n\nThey used to make all the girls sing all the   children  sing and dance \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Okay   \n\n<$B> \n\nSo by that time the nieces were growing up and the nieces and the nephews were there\n\n\nSo it was their turn already\n\n\nThere would always be a short program for whose ever birthday it was and yes a lot of eating drinking and laughing\n\n<$A> \n\nSo he was very I can say that he was very  viva   ,  person\n\n\nHe enjoyed a lot, uhm, \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nSo now we go to his uh he got sick right again sick\n\n\nHow did this affect you your relationship with him when he\n\n<$B> \n\nIt was really it was really hard to believe the first few years because he had always really just been going on and I thought nothing could really faze him\n\n\nI think the only time he had gotten really sick was he had a bypass in his early seventies\n\n\nAnd then in prison he got really really thin\n\n\nBut it was hard to think of him getting sick \n\n Uhm the usual case it only really started showing I think in eighty-six\n\n\nBefore although he would go for treatment he still had hair  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> And he would still go around\n\n\nIn eighty-six he was appointed to the Committee on Human Rights and I was his confidential secretary at that time\n\n\nAnd like there were fact-finding missions he  he was scheduled to go and we couldn't go because he was too ill\n\n\nAnd that was the only time we really saw it\n\n<$A> \n\nHow did that affect him as a person\n\n\nDid he say I 'm sick and you know I 'm I 'm just gonna give up now \n\n<$B> \n\nNo I think he he tried to fight it as much as he could\n\n\nUhm like he would uh he would promise like he would you know get up on certain days and in fact uh I have a notebook of his I got it after he died 'cause he said he had his penmanship really suffered\n\n\nHe had great penmanship and when he got sick he couldn't write\n\n\nIt wasn't as clear\n\n\nAnd he told himself he was going to learn how to write again\n\n\nSo he asked me to buy him one of the you know those writing notebooks  ,  with the blue line the red line the blue line\n\n\nAnd I got it after he died\n\n\n'Cause I said Mom you know can I have this \n\n\nSo I thought it hadn't been used until I noticed at the bottom corner of each page he had written a big A a small A a big D and he was he had full real intentions of practicing\n\n\nUnfortunately I don't think he ever really got to the fourth page\n\n\nHe was sick\n\n\nHe got really tired when he was really really sick he got tired a lot\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nWhat about you\n\n\nHow did you take this\n\n<$B> \n\nIt was it was very hard\n\n\nIt was hard to see him that way 'cause knowing how he had been the years before and how quick his mind

{"text": "<$A> \n\nYeah, did you get my point now  \n\n<$B> \n\nI don't think convenient purposive sampling is a delimitation\n\n\nI think it 's part of the scope\n\n\n  Why would we  delimit the study\n\n<$A> \n\n You think so   \n\n\nOkay so put it in the scope, no problem\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so what else\n\n\nWell for the others, just think it over and try to find out what are the other possible uhm scope or delimitations which you might encounter or we might encounter during the, study itself\n\n\nAnyway uhm just to be sure Bobby told us  na  not to not to stress on this part yet because we 're not yet sure on what we 're going to focus it on\n\n\nSo just add the note there that this uh this scope and limitation is not yet permanent\n\n\nIt 's not it 's only temporary because we 're not yet sure if we 're really going to encounter these limitations\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n\nSo is that clear\n\n<$B> \n\nYes it is\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so the significance is clear and the scope is clear\n\n\nNow let 's go to the things that Bobby told me or was discussed okay\n\n<$B> \n\n  Do I  need to take down notes\n\n<$A> \n\n So   \n\n\nIt 's up to you if you 'd like to okay\n\n\nSo uhm the first thing we talked about was about the review of lit  since it was that one that we really referred to or you were supposed to talk about during the meeting okay\n\n\nNow in the discussion of the review of lit he told us the review of lit was okay\n\n\nIn fact the the the funny part  nga  however was uhm when he gave the when he gave these little pieces of review of lit not the actually the review of lit\n\n\nHe was so happy because he found out that he was not going to have a hard time with us\n\n\nIt seems our mind was loose and indirect and was flow was flowingly good when we gave out or we handed out the real review of lit his mind began to get boggled up yeah there was so many uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIt became complicated\n\n<$A> \n\nIt became complicated\n\n\nFrom the easy thing it became so complicated\n\n\nSo, that 's why he told us to uh limit down or cut down on some of the things that we have in our study or in our review of <.> lit <.> \n\n\nSo uh first and foremost the so, it 's okay the parts\n\n\nUh we have to talk about something about uh poverty, something about uh about uh, aspirations and uh but we have to include another factor and the uhm and that is supposed to be uhm more on the coping patterns and the uh what are the usual resources uh usually encountered during the process\n\n\nAnd at the same time, he also made mention since we have this is the thing that we have to submit for Monday  e  which Tess forgot that we should do\n\n\nAnyway I 'll just call him just call her up and I 'll tell her maybe we 'll just make it up  na lang  on Monday afternoon before we we attend Bobby 's  ano tapos  to formulate so that when we submit it it 's okay  na  \n\n\nNow that part  kasi  we have to figure out what are the questions or the questions that were  kasi  Bobby told us to formulate fifteen questions and these fifteen questions are supposed to be geared in finding out the things we want to learn\n\n\nSo for uh one question in finding out uh what are their goals  tapos  how did they reach their goals the problems reaching their goals and how do they cope in reaching their goals\n\n\n Tapos  another problem which is uhm uh uhm assigned or which was uh related to this was also in knowing uhm what will be the uh bracket of the people that we will be studying\n\n\nWill it be by family or or by age\n\n\nUh Tess and I told Bobby that we 'll be studying by age groups so\n\n<$B> \n\nAge groups\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah so adults you know adolescents uh elderly\n\n\nNow uh when it comes to that we have to figure out or we 'll have to add into our review of related literature, the developmental stages\n\n<$B> \n\n  Uhm  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   so we don't know who 's going to do that yet\n\n\nThat 's why, it 's imperative that next week we start revising our review of lit because we 're going to be starting to work on our chapter two and at the same time revising our review of lit because if we don't start already which is supposed to be today  nga  if we weren't able to meet as a whole today we start it next week\n\n\nAnd midterms next week so many tests we have to find a date and really start it and work it out 'cause if we don't do it we 're not going to finish on time\n\n\nWe 're not going to make the best out of our thesis, okay\n\n\nSo those are the things he told about the review of lit\n\n\nNow, when it goes  naman  to the review of lit again he said  na  uh it was it 's proper  daw kasi  we gave data okay\n\n\nUh the proper format will be to give the data then after giving the data is to to try to relate that data with our study\n\n\n Tapos  uh if and that could be related by either uhm formulating a question or formulating previous studies which are associated with uh what we are studying which could be related to that\n\n\nSo what I mean is when when we have like for example for the poverty or the poor you 've gathered the data so now that we know how many people are poor in the country how would we associate that to uh our study\n\n\nWhat 's the importance of that to our study\n\n\nSo we could uh stress  daw  in question form like uh uhm if there are so many people who are poor in a country uhm what impact would this have on their  ano  on their aspirations in life\n\n\nSo something to associate it with because our output was okay in the sense that it had content\n\n\nThe problem was it lacked a little bit in direction\n\n\nSo we have to direct it\n\n\nSo we have to really we have really to smooth some of the edges which are a little bit rough and I think it there are lots of rough edges\n\n\nFor the indigenous method uh Tess will be the one to handle that\n\n\nAnyway uh it 's quite easy  naman  what Bobby wants to do for that\n\n\nThen uh I think that 's all\n\n\nSo I already discussed to you about the scope and delimitation and together with the significance of the study, the frame of his mind\n\n\nSo if I were you I 'd look for a book related to uh, Adler\n\n<$B> \n\nOr Jung\n\n<$A> \n\nOr Jung or why is it important\n\n\nUh maybe you would like to talk some more and especially in English\n\n\nI 'm the one who 's talking and talking and this tape is running\n\n\nHi Poch\n\n<$B> \n\nI 've nothing, to say\n\n<$A> \n\n Ha  \n\n<$B> \n\nI 've nothing much to say to you\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy so short my goodness  \n\n\nI 've been talking so long in English and you 're not saying anything\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that 's it  na  \n\n Are we through\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I think so, unless you have some more questions\n\n<$B> \n\nI have a question\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it 's not related to our thesis\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's about Psycho Two, the translation\n\n<$A> \n\n  What about it  \n\n<$B> \n\n How do you go about it   \n\n\n Di ba  you were talking to Mrs Abrenica  kanina  \n\n<$A> \n\nWhy would I tell you\n\n<$B> \n\nPlease  naman  because I 'm asking\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't like to\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm asking you\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't like to\n\n<$B> \n\nPlease\n\n<$A> \n\nI want you to have a hard time\n\n<$B> \n\nPlease  naman o  \n\n<$A> \n\n  Well  \n\n<$B> \n\n I 've been   so\n\n<$A> \n\nDefinitely uh next week  ha    we have  to meet please\n\n<$B> \n\n No no   \n\n\nNo for Psycho Two\n\n<$A> \n\n Pero  wait  ha    we really have to meet  \n\n<$B> \n\n  Oo  yeah   it 's okay\n\n\n  No problem  with me\n\n<$A> \n\n And next time   \n\n\nWhen we meet next week I  please let 's have it serious because because we 're not going anywhere\n\n\nEven right now my mind isn't fixed yet on our real target for this thesis okay\n\n\nSo, I 'm just telling you that in advance okay\n\n\nNow where were we\n\n<$B> \n\nPsycho Two\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah what about Psycho Two uh yeah the process of the translations and   stuff  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nWell you see, translation    \n\n\nWell you see, uh in the translation there are so many methods that we might use\n\n\nYeah  ha  \n\n\nPaper\n\n\nNo oh there are so many methods of translations that we might use\n\n\nNow uhm in those methods of translations for example in our case we would be using the bilingual form of translation\n\n\nIn essence what would happen here would be we have uh the  we will get the uh copy of uh of the words that we were supposed to translate and we 're going to get the copy of that which is in uh in Tagalog or Filipino\n\n\nAnd we 're going to ask a bilingual to translate that into English  ,  okay so for example there 's other words in uh in Filipino and then I ask you Ma'am may you please translate this in English you 're going to translate this in English\n\n\nNow once you have translated it in English we would I would then try to compare how are you able to translate it\n\n\nBut\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nCompared to the original\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah with the original\n\n\nThen after doing so I would ask a monolingual not any more a bilingual a monolingual is someone who is really an expert in the in the in vocabulary or in words\n\n\nYou got me\n\n\nYes, okay now this monolingual will countercheck\n\n<$B> \n\nMonolingual in what in in expert in English or   in Tagalog  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah yeah   yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nIn English\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes yes yes you got it very good\n\n\nNow this monolingual will then check the translation that you made okay together with the translation uh, uh together with the English form and try to find out if they are matching okay\n\n\nNow whatever the monolingual finds out and whatever you found out from the bilingual will then be uh written down in a form of synthesis\n\n<$B> \n\nAhh\n\n<$A> \n\nTo inform how were you able to check it out and at the same time it is also essential to know uh if uh if the way it was translated was in the proper way or not\n\n\nYou got my point\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\n  Okay  \n\n<$B> \n\n I   see your point\n\n\nIt 's very big help, the point\n\n<$A> \n\nThe point\n\n<$B> \n\nThe point that you made is so big\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay good, okay\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause  ano  \n\n\nYou give me the mike\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so get the mike get the mike\n\n<$B> \n\nOh it 's  \n\n<$A> \n\nMike\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\n Ha , no\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm finished\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no no no don't say I 'm pinished  say don't say I 'm pinished \n\n\nThat 's wrong  e    that 's wrong grammar  \n\n<$B> \n\n I 'm finished   \n\n<$A> \n\nNo no no you say   I 'm   \n\n<$B> \n\n I 'm through   \n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's slang\n\n\nMake it more eloquent \" I 'm finished \", yeah\n\n\nNow you try it \" I 'm finished \" \n\n\nYou try it you try it come on now, don't be ashamed\n\n\nIt 's okay it 's okay uhm you know some people commit\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm not ashamed for myself I 'm ashamed for you\n\n<$A> \n\n wait wait not don't you can't that 's wrong grammar again\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's wrong\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I 'm not ashamed , I 'm not ashamed for myself \n\n<$B> \n\nAshamed I said \" ashamed \"  \n\n<$A> \n\nHey, your Bohol accent is getting uh getting ahead of you again\n\n\nOkay  I 'm not ashamed for myself  not my  I 'm not ashamed I myself  \n\n\nSay  I 'm not ashamed for myself  \n\n\nBut you said  I 'm ashamed for you  \n\n\nYou get me\n\n\nYou get my point, \n\n\nAw if you don't stop laughing nothing will happen in our conversation\n\n\nPoch will get disappointed right Poch\n\n\nOkay, so Poch wait Aw is trying to concentrate\n\n\nAw you 're turning red again\n\n\nSo don't laugh, my goodness, Aw, come on say something\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen are we supposed to submit Psycho Two\n\n<$A> \n\nPsycho Two well it was supposed to be due due  ha  remember due  three weeks from the from the time she gave away\n\n\nI didn't commit the error of saying \" he gave away \" \n\n\nIt 's \" she gave away \" which is usually committed by some some Filipinos in in talking\n\n\nAlright \" she gave away \" was supposed to be due uh three weeks from that date when she gave the

's this there was this lady opening the cabinet and then when the lady faced him she was bloody \n\n\n for my sister that was the scariest part\n\n\nShe wasn't able to sleep for like three nights alone\n\n<$C> \n\nIsn't it that <unclear> words </unclear> at the box office\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah me and my for me the scariest part would when the when the guy was walking down the corridor and then he said uh sooner or later I 'll put you to death and when he turned he had a hole in his head so that 's sick, \n\n<$C> \n\nSo sick\n\n Anyway another question\n\n\nAre you taking your practicum Denise\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm yes I am\n\n<$C> \n\nOh where are you taking it\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'm taking it at Hong Kong Bank it 's at Ayala Avenue\n\n\nThey just moved in they have a new building\n\n\nIt 's quite good I mean it 's interesting 'cause it 's like a new building and then everyone who works there uhm is given an I D with those bar I mean with the bar code in it\n\n\nThen uhm these people can go anywhere and practically anywhere like if if they can they can access like different offices just through that bar code in their I Ds\n\n<$C> \n\nWhat do you do there\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I was assigned to work at the Administration Department\n\n\nUhm I I 'm like I 'm like the secretary of the manager of that department\n\n\nHe gives me like he gives me work every day he 's the one responsible for me\n\n\nUhm I submit I mean he 's the one who checks my time I mean if I have completed my eight hours of work\n\n\nAnd then basically what I do there is like tally the reimbursement forms submitted to him by the officers of the bank\n\n\nYeah and then the manager who I work for has this box and that box every day mail comes in and at practically any time\n\n\nUhm and then what I do is that I sort out the mails inside the box uhm some would be like uhm purchase orders statement of account  you know office box\n\n\nYou where do you plan to work\n\n<$C> \n\nActually I 'm just going to take my practicum next term so, \n\n\nCandice aren't you supposed to take your practicum next term also\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I just came in June\n\n\nDenise but the thing you work in it 's called \" The Enterprise \" right\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's a nice building\n\n\nThey have a nice canteen there\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah but then what 's hard about their canteen is that it really gets really full during lunch hour\n\n\nThat 's really it will take you like fifteen minutes to get a place so it 's nice but you know it 's a hassle eating there\n\n<$C> \n\nHow about the food\n\n<$A> \n\nThe food is okay quite expensive 'cause a meal would cost like a hundred fifty bucks  considering that I don't get paid, uhm my allowance my allowance is uhm, \n\n<$B> \n\nWho do you eat with\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat\n\n<$B> \n\nWho do you eat with\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I eat with my colleagues in the office\n\n\nI mean they 're they 're old people I mean like their ages range from late thirties\n\n\nNo not  naman  late late thirties up until early forties\n\n<$B> \n\nOh so is there anyone <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nUnfortunately there 's none\n\n\nIt 's it could really get frustrating 'cause like you have no one to talk to I mean someone you could talk to the same I mean I mean someone you could converse with 'cause like basically most of them have their own family and they 're like daddies already\n\n\nSo there 's really not much there 's really not much to talk about with them, \n\n<$B> \n\nSo what do you plan to do after you graduate\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm, I haven't really thought about that clearly but right after I graduate I 'm planning to visit my  lola  in Bacolod\n\n\nThere 'cause there 'cause my Mom, 'cause my Mom is from Bacolod so they  stay  \n\n\nAll their relatives are still there but <unclear> too many of </unclear> my cousins left\n\n\nHow about you Candice I 've heard that you like Bacolod so much\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I love Bacolod\n\n\nIt 's such a nice

one\n\n<$A> \n\nHow about you Kay have you been to Bacolod\n\n<$C> \n\nOf course I 've been there 'cause would you believe I come from Iloilo so it 's just a neighboring town\n\n\nSo if I have the time if my family like and I have the time to go there but then we usually stay in Iloilo\n\n<$A> \n\nI 've been to Iloilo like three years ago\n\n\nIt was really fun 'cause I was with my class and  uh during during that time I was still studying at Bacolod and then our teacher our History teacher gave uhm we had a we had to go to a field trip in Iloilo and it was really fun\n\n\nWe went to malls and went to historical sites in Iloilo\n\n<$C> \n\nActually for me there 's not much to do in Iloilo\n\n\nBut in Bacolod I think there 's a lot of night uh clubs night life is so good there compared to Iloilo\n\n\nHey guys would you like to go to Davao I mean particularly in Pearl Farm\n\n<$B> \n\nWhere 's   that  \n\n<$C> \n\n This   this April\n\n\nIt 's in  ano  Davao, \n\n<$A> \n\nYou know I

plantation <unclear> words </unclear> uh I mean before they opened it to the public they opened it to members only, \n\n<$A> \n\nSo for you to be able to go there you have to be a member so you have to pay   a membership fee  \n\n<$C> \n\n Now you don't   now you don't have to do that just go there uhm <unclear> words </unclear> when you get to farmer 's place <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nSo what what what I mean you wanna go or what\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I don't think my Mom would allow me 'cause my Mom is quite paranoid about the, the news about the uhm wars the Muslims in Davao\n\n<$C>

\n\nThat 's a  what uh painting\n\n<$A> \n\nPaintings yeah small paintings\n\n\nUhmm smaller than bond paper size\n\n<$B> \n\nAnyway you know I 'm wondering if if Chuch has already called\nthe   peo  \n\n<$A> \n\n Guests   \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah the guests but she has to she has to instruct them that\n, \n\n<$A> \n\nNot to invite others  \n\n<$B> \n\n Well yeah yeah one thing not to to invite\nothers that the invitations are very limited and then she has to tell them\nnot to park in front of our house so Ma so Mama won't be suspicious  \n\n\nShe 's gonna ask them to to park in front of the neighbor 's house\nso that when Mama I think I think I think Mark arranged uhm for the\nassociation Remi to invite, to to have a meeting that day  \n\n\nWell not really a meeting so a small   mock meeting  \n\n<$A> \n\n Mock meeting   \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah a  a small group meeting just this person\nthat she needs to meet with Mama\n\n<$A> \n\nAhh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd that person is invited to the party\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nSo there so that Mama will be out for the day  \nwhen Mama comes home then she sees all the cars in front of the house that\nwill be funny so I think they instructed they 're going to instruct the\nguests to park their cars there in our neighbor 's house\n\n<$A> \n\nUh hum\n\n<$B> \n\nAnyway\n\n<$A> \n\nFar walk  \n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's not it 's not that far\n\n\nAnyway it 's okay 'cause they 're hardly there anyway they 're\nalways in Pangasinan only the only the  bantays  are there\n\n<$A> \n\nWho 're we talking about\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Sorianos General\n\n<$A> \n\nUh ahh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nMost of the time they 're not there\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n\nGood idea\n\n<$B> \n\nFor every time when when she calls a guest she has to\ninstruct them\n\n<$A> \n\n \n\n<$B> \n\nWell better than the first plan\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat was the first   plan  \n\n<$B> \n\n The   first plan is, because we were planning\nto have it on a Sunday  e  Mama doesn't usually go out on a\nSunday she 's, lazy\n\n\nWhen she gets home she doesn't want to go out anymore so Tong was\n, well she usually on a Sunday Mama just stays in her room and watches T V\nand she hardly goes down\n\n<$A> \n\nUh hum yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nYou noticed\n\n<$A> \n\nUh hum\n\n<$B> \n\nShe only goes down for  merienda  \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd dinner\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd dinner  \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd chit-chat\n\n<$B> \n\nThere so so we were planning we were planning to have them to\nhave the guests go to the basement directly to the basement\n\n<$A> \n\nHuh\n\n<$B> \n\n Imagine they 'll be staying there for a long\ntime uh might be a long time depends on the rate  they come\n, \n\n\nThen anyway after they gather enough they 're going to go up and\nsurprise Mama\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nThen but Mark was saying that 's why he suggested, to have\nit on a Saturday\n\n\nWhat if  syempre  Mama will just be wearing her\nduster  'di ba    ,  so she\nmight feel   and  she won't be fixed up so she might look    funny  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n <unclear> 1 word </unclear>   \n\n\n Saturday 's   better\n\n<$B> \n\nI know I want Saturday  \n\n<$A> \n\nI can <unclear>

\n\n\nWhat was I saying I mean uhm, uh so I told James right   \nthat   what Trish told me\n\n<$B> \n\n That   \n\n<$A> \n\nTrish is like please tell James I don't care if it means having\nto stop seeing him but her point is that she is just tired already\n\n\nTrish is like if you care about me the way you say you are then\nshow it right\n\n\nAnd then so James he  he feels bad\n\n\nJames is like he 's sitting there and he said I 'm really sorry and\nhe hugged me you know\n\n\nHe goes you know I understand now what your sister is saying\n\n\nAnd then he goes I 'm sorry I took you for

that\n\n<$A> \n\n And yeah and oh yeah uhm James was saying\nsomething like oh there 's something about what you said that I was uhm Trish 's\nuhm uhm ex-relationships right\n\n\nJames James was just telling her it 's all in the family you know\nfamily and it was fun because they were trying to be they would see her that\nthey 're together, and Trish even said you know James I 'm sorry about the\nbreak-up but I 'm even sorrier because I 'm not really sorry\n\n\nGet it\n\n\nTrish is like I feel bad that you guys broke up but I don't feel\nthat bad oh but I feel worse that I 'm not sincere I mean in fact   I 'm\nhappy  \n\n<$B> \n\n It only   shows she doesn't love him that much\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah but I was happy that you know\n\n<$B> \n\nSaid Trish\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah Trish was saying that I was happy that you broke up I\nguess not that she wanted James to be hurt it 's because I don't know I guess\nshe felt that she wanted to give James something more <unclear> words\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> and Trish calls her\n\n<$A> \n\nTrish never calls his ex-girlfriend by her full name by her\nfull name\n\n\nTrish always calls her \" would-be ex-girlfriend \" \nlike Trish <unclear> word </unclear> she said that you know you and your\nex-girlfriend because if if Trish calls her by her real name it would sound\nlike they knew each other right\n\n<$B> \n\nBut that 's <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nWe they were introduced uh we were all in here and then they\nwere introduced\n\n\nIn fact James goes oh yeah you know this is my sweetie and then you\nknow sweetie this is Trish\n\n\nSo it was kind of weird you know because the next I think a couple\nof weeks after that they broke up\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then a week later on or a couple of weeks later on, she 's\nwalking down the street sees his car knocks on a window she he puts he rolls\nthe window down and she looks in and Trish and James were in the car right\n\n\nSo she looked she gave Trish this mean like, bad\n\n\nTrish didn't know what to do she was sitting there oh my God, \nJames she shouldn't have seen me I shouldn't have been here\n\n\nAnd James is like I don't care you know screw that she you know she\nleft me she 's got her own reasons why can't I go out on my own\n\n\nBut I guess for a while James was struggling to make Trish feel\nlike she 's the most important person in his life he kept calling her up\n\n\nI guess sometimes <unclear> words </unclear> because like yesterday\nTrish and James were somewhere there right after uhm James <unclear> word\n\n</unclear> and then James 's ex-girlfriend happened to be there\n\n<$B> \n\nOh the other one the older one\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah the older\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah that girl\n\n<$B> \n\nThat   bitch  \n\n<$A> \n\nThat  girl   yeah that B S\n\n\nRight so I was sitting by the lobby you know where the photocopying\nmachine is and she was there and I said hey what 's up you know\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's true <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\n I think so I mean not to <unclear> words\n\n</unclear> about but you know when I see that girl she 's like a like a like\na prostitute or a dead person\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nShe 's so white I mean she used to stare at me in a mean way\nevery time I 'm near her\n\n<$B> \n\nShe did it to Trish too, all of her <unclear> words\n\n</unclear> when she comes in\n\n<$A> \n\n Holy cow\n\n\nSo you know uhm Trish walked over sat down and then the girl Shelly\ngoes hey hi you know\n\n\nTrish was like hey hi and then Shelly 's like oh that 's a nice\njacket and Trish was like thanks but it 's not mine\n\n\nWhose jacket is that\n\n\nJames\n\n\nOh and she has a look like oh okay\n\n\nShelly 's like so uhm are you tired why don't you go home\n\n\nYeah I will in a while I 'm just waiting\n\n\nAnd then she asks like what are you waiting for right and she was\nlike when James is finished\n\n\nOh okay\n\n\nAnd then for a minute there I think Shelly gets it then she looks\nthen she goes so what 's up with you\n\n\nI mean Trish and Shelly would never boast\n\n<$B> \n\nCorrect yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah right\n\n\nIn fact when they came to the station, you know Shelly was like\nhi hi hi d hi but then in the hallway they wouldn't look at each other\n\n<$B> \n\nNot\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n\nSo you know it 's not fishy\n\n\nAnd then uhm she goes so what 's up with you I mean do you have a\nboyfriend\n\n\nThen Trish is like what no I broke up with him a long time ago\n\n\nIt is a long time ago I mean you know if you think about it\n\n<$B> \n\nPretty much\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I mean emotionally it 's not like a long time ago and\nthen Shelly goes oh so are you going out with anyone\n\n\nBut then James told her already before, a couple of weeks after\nI don't care if she finds out that we 're dating\n\n\nIn fact James told his best friend, that you know, that\nthey were dating\n\n\nAnd I you know like Trish is just oh my gosh she was telling me\nright she 's like I 'm the happiest girl alive because I mean how would you\nfeel when your guy tells his best friend that he 's finally dating\n\n\nThat 's a sweet thing when it comes from a guy right\n\n\nSo when I heard about it I was happy for her too but oh my God\nthat 's that 's exciting and and he he he 's got the same birthday as Trish\n, same day yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nReally\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's so weird\n\n<$A> \n\nI know it 's so weird right\n\n\nAnd then yeah so there and I was thrilled when I heard about it I\nwas <unclear> words </unclear> and James sounded so excited\n\n\nHe sounded like a little boy who 's just got a star in class like\nyou know what I told my best friend we were dating and Trish was like oh my\nGod that is really sweet\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then uhm to think that they 're going out on a week-end I\nthink uhm Trish uhm James their friends the other couple Marlon,  Marlo and, Junior\n\n<$A> \n\nMarlon and Junior yeah there we go Marlo and Junior\n\n\nIt 's gonna be Marlo Junior Trish James and then uhm Bert  \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd his uh\n\n<$A> \n\nHis wife Rubber Ducky  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nHis Rubber Ducky\n\n\nIt 's gonna be fun well I don't know I heard that James invited\nBert but Bert is not sure\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah <unclear> words </unclear> James Trish Marlo\n\n<$A> \n\nI know because it will give us you know it will give them the\nchance\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah it 's like a double date for them\n\n<$A> \n\nI know\n\n\nWell James asked Trish if it was okay\n\n\nTrish is like he 's your best friend\n\n\nAgain I 'm not gonna say no to that she says but then I guess yeah\nit would be sweeter to <unclear> words </unclear> other you know I mean I I\n\n<$B> \n\nMarlo already asked her Dad or told her Dad to leave her\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen was that\n\n<$B> \n\nHer Dad said <unclear> words </unclear> so I guess it 's all\nright\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah it is and then\n\n<$A> \n\nI heard\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then Marlo just said <unclear> words </unclear> Trish 's\nsister is there right now\n\n<$A> \n\nOh you know what 's so cool\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat\n\n<$A> \n\n'Cause Trish Trish said that it was it was uh Marlo 's\nbirthday right\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nBut it 's not\n\n\nAnd the funny thing did you say that Marlo 's sis is gonna be\nthere\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause

something  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nShe 's uhm her sister is covering the military camps\n\n<$A> \n\nSee\n\n\nOh my God\n\n\nThat 's such a coincidence see\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's a good thing\n\n<$A>

{"text": "<$A>  \n\nHello\n\n\nMy name is Wendy and I 'm here with Pammy\n\n\nSay hi Pammy\n\n<$B>  \n\nHi\n\n\nI 'm Pammy\n\n<$A>  \n\nOkay so today we 're going to talk about our childhood moments\n\n\nSo I 'm going to start\n\n\nI remember once one time when I was in grade three I was in Ms Mrs Barstow 's class and I was around, oh nine years old, so one day Mrs Barstow asked us asked us to draw a picture with the theme Stop Look and Listen\n\n\nIt was a safety theme like in the traffic when uhm when you 're crossing the street what you what should you do first\n\n\nYou should stop    look  both ways right and    listen  for cars\n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Look    \n\n\n\n Listen    \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$A>  \n\nThat way you 're sure to be safe\n\n\nSo I drew a picture with three scenes\n\n\nUhm in the first scene a girl, just stops she 's just standing there\n\n\nThe second scene she was looking in one direction and the next scene she had her hand up to her ear so as to say she 's listening for something\n\n\nAnd the funny thing about my picture was, the look of the girl  \n\n\nShe, she had so much make-up on  the her eyes are eye shadow was blue and she has  really    really red  lipstick\n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Red blush    \n\n\nAnd a blush-on\n\n<$A>  \n\nAnd a blush\n\n<$B>  \n\nBlush-on\n\n<$A>  \n\nLike you 'd think she 'd look like the Nanny  with big hair and and thin body and make-up\n\n\nI think it was because I was influenced so much by my mother because growing up I always saw her every morning applying her make-up\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah just like the Flintstones that  advertisement wherein the kid one time uhm her Mom went out oh I think went to work and then she she went inside her Mom 's room and then she got all those make-up stuff of her Mom\n\n<$A>  \n\nOh yeah\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah remember\n\n<$A>  \n\nShe 's trying    to put  make-up on and the    lipstick 's going  everywhere and yeah so my picture really looked strange especially since she had so much make-up on\n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Yeah    \n\n\n\n Yeah    \n\n<$A>  \n\nWell anyway so we submitted all our pictures in to the teacher\n\n\nAnd unknowingly what the teacher did was she submitted all our drawings into a contest a traffic contest that was sponsored by oh some traffic organization for safety and, \n\n\nSo in a few days she gave us back our pictures, but then I noticed that I didn't get mine back\n\n\nSo I thought where 's mine 'cause everybody else have theirs you know\n\n\nI didn't wanna feel left out\n\n\nSo I asked Mrs Barstow where is my picture and then she goes and then she says that she entered my picture into a into that contest and it hadn't come back\n\n\nSo I thought a contest okay that 's fine    so  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n How    old were you then\n\n<$A>  \n\nI was around nine or ten grade three and uhm, \n\n\nSo after a few days, my drawing came back, and my teacher said, that I had won, that my entry was one of the selected drawings from uh in a in that contest that which is open to so many others from different schools\n\n<$B>  \n\nOh that 's great Wen\n\n\nSo what did you get\n\n\nWhat prize did you get\n\n<$A>  \n\nWell it wasn't really a prize thing but I did get the poster that on which they printed all the different uhm drawings that they selected as winners\n\n\nSo that was nice\n\n\nI actually have that poster up till now\n\n<$B>  \n\nWow that 's great\n\n<$A>  \n\nOh so well what about you Pam  \n\n<$B>  \n\nWell for me uhm, when I was in grade three I also remember we used to have art classes every Wednesdays and Fridays I guess so but that was a long time ago\n\n\nBut what I enjoyed most about my childhood years was that I I always bring my Barbie stuff my Barbie dolls remember\n\n<$A>  \n\nOh Barbie I had one uhm\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah I have I guess I have three and I always bring the three Barbies to school and of course show them off to my friends and we play all day\n\n\nOne time, uhm it was our yeah I remember it was Ms Garcia 's class\n\n\nI think that was our Filipino class yeah\n\n\nAnd then I I I don't wanna listen I I don't know I guess I was just so excited with my with my new Barbie\n\n\nAnd then so I didn't listen and and then while in the class I was playing with my Barbie and then my  the worst thing is my sister saw me playing me with the Barbie\n\n\nAnd then so of course the teacher approach approached me and she talked to me uhm Ms Villanueva why are you not listening to me do stop \n\n\nAnd then I go like No Miss I am listening \n\n\nThen my teacher told me okay well give me your Barbie \n\n\nAfter that of course the the the the usual reaction of a kid is to cry\n\n\nSo I cried as in I really cried\n\n\nSo when I went home my Mom asked me oh why are  why are your eyes so red \n\n\nSo I told him what happened\n\n\nAnd then the next day my Mom my Mom went to my teacher\n\n<$A>  \n\nWhoa\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$A>  \n\nMom against teacher\n\n<$B>  \n\nMy Mom actually my Mom didn't  parang  uhm didn't shout at my teacher or what\n\n\nShe just asked of course why is my uhm Barbie with her 'cause I didn't tell her uhm I didn't tell her I didn't told her that I was I wasn't listening\n\n\nSo otherwise my Mom was thinking that my teacher just got, just got\n\n<$A>  \n\nJust took your Barbie away\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah just took my Barbie away\n\n\nSo what happened is instead of my Mom  uhm uhm scolding my teacher at the end my Mom scolded me so, \n\n\nUntil now I don't know if my Barbie is still in the house but I remember I didn't get it back anymore, \n\n<$A>  \n\nPammy I think you 're the original Barbie girl  \n\n\nWell Barbies actually I didn't really get a Barbie until I was pretty old\n\n<$B>  \n\nReally\n\n<$A>  \n\nUh I mean some girls get it when they 're    six  or seven\n\n\nI got mine when I was eight or nine and I think it was given to me by my godfather and godmother\n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Six    \n\n\nOh that 's nice\n\n\nIn our family as in all of us should have Barbie at least one\n\n<$A>  \n\nYikes\n\n\nActually I don't really like dolls those that kind of dolls even\n\n<$B>  \n\nDolls with long hair\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$B>  \n\nSexy bodies\n\n<$A>  \n\nWhat I really liked were the dresses\n\n\nI loved dressing them up\n\n\nI had a Barbie and she had this long dress and sometimes since she had such a long dress I 'd make it shorter    or  up to the knees 'cause it really went down up to her ankles\n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Yeah    \n\n<$A>  \n\nUnfortunately of course I had a brother and being a brother he broke the head off\n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Yeah  \n\n\nOh\n\n<$A>  \n\nSo there you go\n\n\nNo more Barbie, beheaded Barbie\n\n<$B>  \n\nMy my brothers can't, touch my stuff  they can't touch my Barbie\n\n\nThose are my favorite things when like when I was still small and I used to have those big houses of Barbie\n\n<$A>  \n\nOw\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah with the car yeah with the cars we have Ken of course\n\n<$A>  \n\nOf course\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah I remember, \n\n<$A>  \n\nNo I didn't have any accessories as grand    as that  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n As that    \n\n<$A>  \n\nBut you know I 'm pretty much a simple person\n\n\nI don't go for    those dolls  especially those dolls that when you sit them up they open their eyes and then when you lie them back down they close their eyes    remember those  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Yeah you 're right    \n\n \n\n<$A>  \n\nThey 're so freaky they 're\n\n<$B>  \n\nActually they 're so scary\n\n<$A>  \n\nThey are really I hated them\n\n<$B>  \n\nI hate them also, I hate them and they

Shangri-La\n\n\nNo Megamall right\n\n\n Kasi  I have to go shopping for new jeans 'cause I don't have jeans anymore\n\n\nNo no no 'cause I  I have this this pair but then it 's like it 's like  sobrang    destroyed already  \n\n<$A> \n\n You know the only   reason why you 're going to Megamall   is because  your Mom asked you to enroll your brother\n\n<$B> \n\n Is to buy jeans   \n\n\nYes but I don't wanna go to   Quad and enroll  'cause there was a  flood  there\n\n<$A> \n\n But you wouldn't be going   \n\n\nYou wouldn't be going to Megamall if your Mom didn't ask you to\n\n<$B> \n\nNo 'cause I I should be in, in in in Shangri-La\n\n\nAnyway so we 're gonna go to Megamall because I wanna buy jeans and Louis wants to look for some shirts and and some summery outfits I

\n\nYes that kid\n\n\nHe he 's yeah I think the reason why the the older guy got the award was that he   was old  \n\n<$A> \n\n He was the oldest guy   \n\n<$B> \n\nHe better win something\n\n\nIt 's like it 's like a it 's like  si  Mad and  si  Ella and Pacos okay\n\n\nThat 's  okay  lang 'yon  Sir\n\n\nIt it 's uh Mad and Ella and Pacos\n\n\nYou know what Ella said the  why they will you know they were they gonna graduate  na  this term\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n\nWhat 's the reason\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause Pacos is so old he he better graduate  na  \n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's   mean  \n\n<$B> \n\n  Kasi     \n\n<$A> \n\nThat is so mean\n\n<$B> \n\nNo  he was just kidding  kasi parang 'yun  Pacos is what ninety-four ninety-five  like really old now   but he 's still here  \n\n<$A> \n\n He 's I D number ninety-five I think   \n\n<$B> \n\nYou see he 's still here\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy I 'm gonna graduate a year from now and I 'm I D ninety-six I 'm gonna be  finishing my college degree in five years\n\n\nThat 's so   pathetic  \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh no   it 's okay 'cause you you you you were from computer science so your case is understandable\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy Pacos Pacos is from computer science\n\n<$B> \n\nExactly so we 've got to get our thesis good you know\n\n\nPass the first time we get it okay\n\n<$A> \n\nNo problem we won't fail the thesis and uhm Mr Largoza told us that we should avoid having our better halves\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so  we won't \n\n Toks\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay I 'll get Joy and and\n\n<$B> \n\nYou can't it 's gonna be Kristel Joy and Dods\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I 'll look for someone else\n\n<$B> \n\n O   go ahead \n\n Who 's stopping you\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'm just kidding I 'm just kidding\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nYou 're like that  naman e  \n\n<$B> \n\n What 's that English for  ganyan ka naman e  \n\n<$A> \n\nYou 're leaving for Canada  na  that 's why\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay okay let 's talk about let 's talk about something else okay  \n\n\nOkay now we 're gonna talk about something sensible\n\n\nGo on Louis\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat do you think about the Clean Air Act\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat 's the Clean Air Act\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay the Clean Air Act is I think it 's principally authored by Loren Legarda\n\n\nActually I saw the  the deliberations on T V and it was I think five four months ago\n\n\nThe Clean Air Act is all about uhm, removing leaded gasoline from the metropolis\n\n\nIt 's  filling  out leaded gasoline and favoring unleaded gasoline instead\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it isn't like unleaded is not really too good for the car\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm let 's put it this way it 's not that 's not good for the for old cars but it makes the acceleration slower\n\n\nBut it 's cleaner than leaded fuel\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so so what do I think \n\n livable well I think yeah I 'm gonna go for it\n\n\nBut then oh no you know what we 're gonna talk about, death penalty\n\n\nI love that topic uh as as hard-core Catholic that I am I 'm so for death penalty\n\n<$A> \n\nI am so for death penalty\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know I mean I 'm not I don't even know why why these uhm like priests and and nuns are lobbying for for for uhm uhm no death penalty\n\n<$A> \n\n Hindi  uhm   actually  \n\n<$B> \n\n Okay so   okay okay\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat Sir has been telling us it it makes a whole lot of sense\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich is\n\n<$A> \n\nThe the Bureau of Prisons is called   correctional corrections  so they 're supposed to be correctional facilities\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah Bureau of Corrections but come on   \n\n\nLook at it this way if that was your daughter who was raped would you want the guy to be  corrected nor rehabilitated\n\n\nWould you want that\n\n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nI wouldn't want that\n\n<$B> \n\nYou want them dead A S A P\n\n\nI 'm sorry\n\n<$A> \n\nYou 're excited\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I mean think about it\n\n\nI mean I 'm a girl and if I was raped do I want him to be corrected I want him killed ahhh\n\n\nI would want to to inject that injection to him and you know watch him die\n\n<$A> \n\nI think they have to adjust the conditions wherein they will apply the death penalty\n\n<$B> \n\nI was thinking\n\n<$A> \n\n'Cause heinous crimes is is a very broad topic and they should narrow it down to specific topics further\n\n<$B> \n\nI think what they should do is that you know if if they know that this guy is a repeater repeating offender well I mean you know okay kill him but if if it 's like a first time thing and, I don't know I I I no you know what\n\n<$A> \n\nI think that\n\n<$B> \n\nI take it back uh first time whatever, minor or not you get killed because you you know it 's like this you you expect the the person he she has the right to live too and by doing that you took away that that privilege\n\n<$A> \n\nI think to solve this problem about the death penalty well first they have to efficiently fund the Bureau of Corrections\n\n<$B> \n\nYes yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nThey have to hire decent psychologists psychiatrists\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nPeople who could rehabilitate these people because uhm you could can't go on without saying that these people need help\n\n\nThey need assistance and most of the crimes committed were  were  were primarily because of uhm uhm tsk, what, poor parental supervision when they were kids violence within the home or within the household\n\n<$B> \n\nNo but then they there are like those kids uh, like let 's say Freddie Webb Freddie Webb no the kid you know that he didn't grow up with an abusive father", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

feeling okay\n\n\nWe just had lunch in Aristocrat\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's good\n\n\nHey guys you never told me about your love story\n\n\nYou tell me about it\n\n<$A> \n\nWell our love story is kinda long\n\n\nIf it 's\n\n\nIs it your break right now\n\n<$B> \n\nYes it is\n\n<$A> \n\nWell if you have time maybe you can listen to it\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I have all the time in the world\n\n<$A> \n\nWell, so when where do you want me to start\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom the beginning of course\n\n<$A> \n\nWell, okay\n\n\nIt all started when I was second year college\n\n\nIt was the first week since classes start\n\n\nI was trying to enjoy school\n\n\nI thought things didn't go my way because I had to take a leave of absence\n\n\nSince I didn't want to accumulate failed units and I couldn't coordinate my studies, and my football practices, friends kept me company and all I did was to have fun with them, and play football\n\n\nI liked some girls but I always found something wrong in each of them that made me stop liking them\n\n\nUsually because they don't meet up to my standards\n\n\nSince I already wanted to have an inspiration and get my life fixed there 's this girl in her first year, a new fresh face in school\n\n\nHer name was Lala\n\n\nI liked her right away\n\n\nBut I didn't have the guts to show her\n\n\nWe had common friends and I eventually got to be with her quite often\n\n\nI realized that she was easy to get along\n\n\nShe was funny, easy to talk to, and of course attractive\n\n\nI never thought I 'd get close to her\n\n\nI still didn't have the guts to show her that I liked her\n\n\nOne day during the second term, it was the first day of class, I saw Lala in the classroom where I was enrolled\n\n\nI realized that I didn't need that to take that subject, only to find out that I took it already\n\n\nThere was a mistake somewhere I don't know\n\n\nThe teacher spoke to me and asked me to drop the class\n\n\nBut I didn't want to because I felt so lucky and happy to be with to be her classmate\n\n\nI decided to stay and sat  sit behind her\n\n\nThe class was so boring and she was all I looked at\n\n\nShe was just smiling at me the whole time  \n\n\nAnd, it lit up my day somehow\n\n\nShe was really bored and, she didn't know anyone in class\n\n\nSo she turned to me and taught me funny songs of April Boys Rico Rico J Puno and other songs\n\n<$B> \n\nApril Boys\n\n<$A> \n\nYup, and, those days that was like the hit song\n\n<$B> \n\nYuck  \n\n<$A> \n\nShe made me sing with her, and laugh so hard\n\n\nThe teacher always caught our attention\n\n\nAnd we enjoyed PHILHIS  from then on\n\n\nWeeks later she asked for my seatmate 's telephone number\n\n\nAnd I said how come me you never ask my phone number\n\n\nShe said Oh yeah, what 's your number \n\n\nThen, I gave it to her\n\n\nShe called me over the weekend and I said hello\n\n\nShe sang she sang our favorite song we used to sing in PHILHIS which was, the song by,  The Fugees called Fugeela \n\n\nThen I started laughing, \n\n\nI didn't have to ask who it was\n\n\nAfter that I found that her friends didn't have the same break as her so I called\n\n\nSo from then on I kept her company for lunch\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd that 's how it started\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah, that 's how it kind of started\n\n\nWe got closer and closer until I felt that I wanted to be with her more often\n\n\nShe even invited me to her birthday party\n\n\nAnd I was really excited and nervous about it\n\n\nWeren't you there\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I think I was and I saw you\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah that that was our first uhm acquaintance if you might, want to call it that way\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but, when did you start really falling for her\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm let me see, \n\n\nI fell I really fell for her when we started to get close to each other\n\n\nAnd we started sharing our secrets\n\n\nWe started to know more about each other\n\n\nAnd that 's when I realized that she 's the kind of girl who I 'd love to be with and spend most of the time with\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd the rest of your life with\n\n<$A> \n\nProbably  \n\n\nI don't know\n\n\nHow about you\n\n\nWhy don't you tell me something about your boyfriend if you\n\n\nDo you have one\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I do\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah what 's his name\n\n<$B> \n\nUh his name is Thomas\n\n\nBut you still haven't told me how you asked her\n\n<$A> \n\nHow I asked Lala\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah you have to tell me that\n\n<$A> \n\nWell it was, a Saturday night\n\n\nBefore that I invited her to my friend 's birthday party which was in Dasma \n\n\nAnd so, we spent the whole night together\n\n\nAnd when the day end uh when the night ended excuse me, before I, dropped her to her car, I gave her uh a goodnight kiss\n\n<$B> \n\n  Where  \n\n<$A> \n\n In the   in the lips of course\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah and and she she made you kiss   her  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   it was, more of a friendly smack, in that that night\n\n\nThen after, uh, \n\n\nSo I felt that night wasn't complete without saying what I felt for her\n\n<$B> \n\nOh my God\n\n<$A> \n\n And then after I called\n\n\nWhen she got home I called her up\n\n\nAnd eventually I told her that I loved her and   she 's  \n\n<$B> \n\n And   what did she say\n\n<$A> \n\nShe said yeah me too \n\n\nBut then that love was more like I love you as a friend something like that\n\n\nSo, now that I got to say how I felt it made me feel better\n\n\nThen the next day we talked about it\n\n\nAnd then after, we kinda, exchanged thoughts about each other, \n\n\nAnd, I don't know, \n\n\nLove took its course from then on\n\n<$B> \n\nWow what a very inspiring story\n\n<$A> \n\nThank you Issa\n\n\nHow about you\n\n\nCan you tell me something about your boyfriend\n\n<$B> \n\nAbout Tommy\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n\nWhat 's his real name\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm Thomas  Skiden  \n\n<$A> \n\n  Oh  \n\n<$B> \n\n Well   he 's Swedish that 's why he has that family name\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n\nUhm how did you meet\n\n<$B> \n\nTommy well\n\n\nTommy and I we met at a friend 's party at the Hard Rock Cafe  last August of nineteen ninety-six\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I 'm always there\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yeah\n\n\nHow come I didn't see you that night\n\n<$A> \n\nProbably because I was out with my Lala\n\n<$B> \n\nWow  \n\n\nAnyway I didn't really expect to meet someone like him\n\n<$A> \n\n  Yeah  \n\n<$B> \n\n 'Cause   that time, my my mind was pretty  preoccupied\n\n\nIt was I was thinking about someone else\n\n\nAnd that time, uhm we weren't really in good terms\n\n<$A> \n\nReally\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd so when I met him I just decided what the heck just talk to him and entertain him the whole night since it was my friend 's party anyway\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah, \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd we started talking\n\n\nAnd then we found that we had so much things in common\n\n\nAnd then he asked me to dance\n\n\nAnd so I danced with him\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah you danced\n\n<$B> \n\n  And  \n\n<$A> \n\n What song   \n\n<$B> \n\nI remember we danced to Let 's Groove by   Earth  Wind and Fire\n\n<$A> \n\n Oh   \n\n\nI like that song\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah it it 's a cool song\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd after that night it became one of our songs for each other   'cause it 's so  memorable\n\n<$A> \n\n Cool, so that night   \n\n\nSo that that was a night to remember\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yeah you bet\n\n\nIt if it weren't for that night we wouldn't have met\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo after that night uhm he asked he started calling me up, 'cause he asked for my number from my friend\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd so of course I gave it 'cause I kinda, liked him in a way\n\n<$A> \n\nIn a friendly way or\n\n<$B> \n\nIn a friendly way because he was such a sweet person\n\n\nAnd then, before I knew it, he started  not not courting but, showing signs of  ,  liking me already\n\n\nBut at that time I liked someone else \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nReally\n\n<$B> \n\nYes, I think he 's your I think he 's your friend  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh what 's his name\n\n<$B> \n\n Tonio   \n\n<$A> \n\n Tonio  yeah he 's my friend\n\n\nHe plays football with me\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah uh I know that  \n\n\nAnyway\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what happened between you and  Tonio  before, you and Tommy\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm  Tonio  and I were have been friends for, two years\n\n<$A> \n\nTwo years\n\n\nThat 's too   long  \n\n<$B> \n\n And   during that time we knew that we liked each other but nothing happened\n\n<$A> \n\nOh really\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd that frustrated me because I thought he liked me\n\n\nAnd if he had liked me then he would have\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I think   he  \n\n<$B> \n\n Started   calling me up already\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I think he really liked you then\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but then, he   didn't show  signs\n\n<$A> \n\n He was just   he was just too shy probably\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah anyway\n\n<$A> \n\nAnyway back to your story\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah uhm when I started getting to know Tommy better, I started thinking to myself why not give him a chance and drop  Tonio  \n\n<$A> \n\nExactly\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah that was what I did, last\n\n<$A> \n\nWas that a difficult decision\n\n<$B> \n\nIt was one of the most difficult decisions in my life but it was the best that I 've made so far\n\n<$A> \n\nSo it was a blessing\n\n<$B> \n\nYes it was a blessing in disguise\n\n\nI met uh we started talking we started really talking to each other last October of nineteen ninety-six and then uhm which means we 'd start going out\n\n\nHe 'd asked me out on dates\n\n\nHe 'd call me up every day\n\n\nThen if\n\n<$A> \n\nWow\n\n\nHe 's so sweet\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah he 's very sweet and if I couldn't go out on a weekend he would insist that he 'd see me\n\n\nSo he 'd tell me he 'd ask me if I if he could visit me at home\n\n<$A> \n\nHe really showed his emotions for you\n\n<$B> \n\nYes like he was very open about it he wasn't shy\n\n\nThere is no pride in him like he he fully expressed his likeness for me\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I and I and I  and I accepted it 'cause I like the feeling that it was giving me\n\n\nI 'd have butterflies in my stomach\n\n<$A> \n\nIt made you feel like a girl\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I am a girl  \n\n\nWell yeah it made he made me feel like a lady like a woman there\n\n\nAnd then, uhm, he asked me, December twenty of he asked me last December twenty-one nineteen ninety-six\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nI remember that day\n\n\nI 'll never

\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd he asked me already that night\n\n<$A> \n\nNo way\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah and that\n\n<$A> \n\nSo were you shocked\n\n<$B> \n\nI was shocked I\n\n<$A> \n\nSurprised\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I was so surprised\n\n<$A> \n\nSpeechless\n\n<$B> \n\nVery speechless because I didn't I didn't love him yet that time I just liked him a lot\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nBut he told me already that he loved me so what I did was that I just took the chance risked it I risked I risked it\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean I won't it 's not as if I 'm gonna end up marrying him anyway and I was young then so might as well\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then so I answered him yes\n\n<$A> \n\nWow\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd ever since that night, I I I 've become the happiest girl here you know like in the world\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\n'Cause he 'd always be so nice to   me  \n\n<$A> \n\n So it all   paid off eventually\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yeah it it all paid off\n\n\nBut there 's one big problem

\n\nWhat time did you wake up\n\n<$A> \n\nSix A M\n\n<$B> \n\nSix A M I woke up at five thirty\n\n<$A> \n\nSix A M and then I was here eight sharp\n\n\nI was looking for the  I was lost this morning\n\n<$B> \n\nSo was I\n\n\nI was lost I was lost\n\n<$A> \n\nI was looking for the classroom and then I saw Lisa and then we saw another classmate and then she said oh it 's at William Hall\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm second floor yeah I had the misconception that it was gonna be held in our classroom that 's why I went there\n\n\nI   was running after  Marianne\n\n<$A> \n\n That 's what I thought   \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then when I went up there where is Marianne \n\n\nShe 's gone and so I figured this must be the wrong room\n\n\nSo I went downstairs again and proceeded to the office of Dr Cruz and I saw him uh drinking water fountain asked him where the exam is gonna be held\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what was your question\n\n<$B> \n\nUh the question was\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat number did you get\n\n<$B> \n\nI think it 's number two\n\n<$A> \n\nNumber two\n\n<$B> \n\nAsking me about the best module\n\n\nHow about you\n\n<$A> \n\nNumber three the best teacher\n\n<$B> \n\nOh it 's sort of related so who did you choose as best teacher\n\n<$A> \n\nActually uhm Marianne Marianne <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd how long did it take you to you know\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I tried to talk so that I could consume my five minutes so  I I didn't want them to ask me any follow-up question\n\n\nBut then uhm the examiner had the chance to ask me a question which wasn't related to the original question that I got\n\n\nSo I was really nervous but after that it was a relief\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah it 's a relief\n\n\nI also thought that I was able to consume the five minutes but I was wrong\n\n\nI guess they don't know how to count counting it backwards I suppose\n\n\nI think I only finished uh I I finished my explanation in uh two and a half minutes\n\n<$A> \n\n Hindi kasi  you speak very fast\n\n<$B> \n\nVery very fast and so when I when I was done and I was looking at the what do you call this what the Dr Isagani Cruz was looking at and I figured that well I still have about three minutes two minutes four minutes and so they were able to ask me several questions two to three questions and he was even thinking what to ask me\n\n<$A> \n\nI was lucky because the examiner only had two questions\n\n<$B> \n\nWas it difficult\n\n\nWhat was the exact question\n\n<$A> \n\nIt it 's difficult because I don't think it 's related to the question that I got\n\n\nThe the follow-up question was how was I gonna teach the same subject to a second year biology class so\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's really difficult because I haven't really thought about that\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd we were talking earlier that uh Marianne I and Purita were talking that it 's better to have the examination really really early in the morning so   that  he 's still out of sync which he does\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nHe doesn't know what to ask\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nSince she 's feeling her way so we figured we would have a very very uh good   advantage  \n\n<$A> \n\n Because I   when I when it was my turn she was already getting the hang of it so that 's why\n\n<$B> \n\nDefinitely\n\n\nFirst she was just observing   you know  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nTrying to ask careful questions and all that and I made the explanation very very long\n\n\nThat same question that she asked me I made it very very long but still unfortunately it wasn't long enough because Dr Cruz still asked me another question\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOut of this world\n\n\nI don't remember now what he asked me\n\n<$A> \n\nAnyway don't you remember just to change the topic\n\n\nI don't wanna talk about it anymore  \n\n\nIt was really it really gives me a funny feeling when I think about it the oral exam\n\n\nWhat are you gonna do this summer\n\n<$B> \n\nThis summer I 'm still gonna teach\n\n<$A> \n\nTeach\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I have a teaching load this summer\n\n\nHow about you\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uh uhm what am I gonna do\n\n\nDivulge\n\n\nUhm I 'm going to Hong Kong with my boyfriend\n\n\nWe 're going to visit my father and my sisters so I leave uhm before the fifteenth, \n\n\nMy sister who 's twelve years old  na  she 's going to be baptized on the twenty-second so and it 's my father 's birthday on the twenty-seventh too\n\n<$B> \n\nGood for you at least you 're gonna have a vacation\n\n<$A> \n\nI have had such a long vacation because I haven't worked since I graduated\n\n<$B> \n\nReally how long has it been\n\n<$A> \n\nMarch ninety-nine since March ninety-nine\n\n<$B> \n\nMarch ninety-nine so it 's been a year\n\n<$A> \n\n'Cause after graduation I went to Hong Kong my my father didn't really think that I should get an M A\n\n\nIt was already June when he decided uh maybe you should get an M A \n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I went back for the second term   and  when I got back, I didn't really think of working first because I was you know\n\n\nI   tend to study again  \n\n<$B> \n\n I see   \n\n around for a year huh\n\n\n  Enjoying yourself  \n\n<$A> \n\n Not exactly   because when I came here it was really, uhm a time for coping   because  back in college it was really spoon-feeding \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nVery different here\n\n<$B> \n\nI have to agree\n\n<$A> \n\nSo, and then last month I started applying, and I I passed the examinations at the Bank of Commerce for Corporate Communications\n\n\nI 'm still set for a final interview but I don't think I 'm gonna go for it\n\n\n  I don't  \n\n<$A> \n\nI just wanted to experience, because I 'm studying because I wanna teach  ,  \n\n\nSo why should I\n\n\nI was thinking if I 'd get a summer job but then I didn't know that I was going to leave for Hong Kong okay\n\n<$B> \n\n Why not   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nHow long would you be staying in Hong Kong\n\n<$A> \n\nJust for a month because I 'm going to enroll for the first term\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yeah first term would be uh\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat about you\n\n\nHow 's teaching\n\n<$B> \n\nHow 's teaching\n\n\nOh boy\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat are your students like\n\n<$B> \n\nMy students uh most of them come from public schools\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I prefer that\n\n\nI teach at S T I\n\n\nPeople keep on asking me why why why why not you know   teach  in a   better  school\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Yeah   \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nThe question is you know uh why is it that the good teachers always end up in good universities\n\n\nI mean we have already so many good teachers in for example in this university\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't think I 'm needed here anymore unlike   in the schools there  \n\n<$A> \n\n Why not   \n\n<$B> \n\nUnlike for example at the S T I the students really need good teachers there   because  they don't have a good background uh especially  pag  public schools chances are all of the subject matters not even spoon-feeding   nothing  they know nothing when they come in grammar is zero zero\n\n\nNot only zero, \n\n\nAnd I pity them\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nI agree\n\n\nAnd their confidence level is really   low  \n\n<$B> \n\n Very very   low but they 're nicer \n\n\n  They 're nicer  because because of the confidence level\n\n\nWhen I uh when when we 're with our uhm what do you call this uh the students there in Mr Cruz 's class Dr Cruz 's class the the undergrads there compared to the undergrads at S T I <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah they are   \n\n Uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI can't even uh what do you call this Iv  I can't even fathom how these particular students from S T I were able to graduate from high school  ,  in the first place\n\n\nBut they 're very very eager to learn compared to the students here who are a little bit you know   smart-ass  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nYeah  which is a good sign   \n\n\nThat 's a good sign that they are going to to learn more because they 're eager to learn\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm they 're eager to learn\n\n\nHow about you\n\n\nWhere do you plan to teach if ever\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I have an application in a college in Lucena City  ,  and in a university\n\n\nI plan to teach part-time because I 'm studying right\n\n\nSo I haven't gone back there yet but they said that I can start in June\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nAre you gonna teach what subjects\n\n<$A> \n\nEnglish mostly and Literature\n\n<$B> \n\nLiterature both\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo how many units do you think you 'll be taking on\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nI haven't really thought about that\n\n\nI haven't talked to them again\n\n\n  I have to go there  \n\n<$B> \n\n But you 're really   uh what do you call this eager to teach  na  this June\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I don't know\n\n\nWhat do you think\n\n\nDo you think I 'd make a good teacher\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course   I mean <unclear> words </unclear> enroll  \n\n<$A> \n\n I  'cause I haven't taught   before\n\n\nYou know\n\n\nEven the presentation last Saturday I haven't really done that before so I was really nervous\n\n<$B> \n\nNow you can say that you 've already done it\n\n\nThere 's a first time for everything\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah but, that still doesn't uhm make a qualification for me to become a teacher\n\n<$B> \n\nI guess uh what do you call this with the way you\n\n<$A> \n\nOr okay let me put it this way, uhm do you think I have the potential\n\n<$B> \n\nTo teach\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause I am when I was in college I didn't really think that I was going to be a teacher someday\n\n\nBut I think my father wanted me to to become one because my grandmother was a teacher\n\n<$B> \n\nNow I wanna throw back the question right back at you\n\n\nWhat do you think\n\n\nDo you have what it takes to become a good teacher\n\n<$A> \n\nTo to become a good teacher I uh I think it 's too early to tell for me, 'cause I 'm still in the uh what do you call this I 'm still trying to get a feel, \n\n\nI 'm not there yet\n\n<$B> \n\nYou 're not there yet\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nHow did it feel  'no  the first time last week when you presented\n\n<$A> \n\nI was really nervous and I think uh, 'cause Lisa told me you know you should smile because you were too serious when you presented your demo \n\n<$B> \n\nI guess so\n\n<$A> \n\nThat was caused by my my my my nervousness\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYou see I 'm still fumbling now when I talk talk about it  ano  uhm, that 's it I think, I get really nervous, that 's it, \n\n<$B> \n\nWell my experience uhm first semester of teaching I was like this uh very uh strict Hitler type of a teacher\n\n\nI shouted at everybody I was uh I was always uh, demanding them to do more than they should\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI guess first timers for me  ha  first timers are stricter so to speak but you know as you go along the way you discover things we have to learn along the way\n\n\nIt 's just like when you have your first class in the morning and you still don't know what to do but then eventually as the day progresses nine ten o'clock you can become better and better and better\n\n\nEventually  ,  at the one o'clock class perfect   the lesson  plan is perfect\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nI guess it 's something like that\n\n\nYou just have to develop a stronger \n\n the students that I have right now it 's very very easy\n\n\nBut if the students are like the students here it 's gonna be a little bit more difficult\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nYeah of course\n\n<$B> \n\nTheir expectations are difficult uh uh different from rather from uh uh those\n\n<$A> \n\nHigher\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah   definitely  \n\n<$A> \n\n In   our classmates   are very very  \n\n<$B> \n\n I remember remember when they   criticized the the one the\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWho demoed  uh who had a   demo with us  \n\n<$A> \n\n Manny   especially\n\n<$B> \n\nManny yeah Manny I guess they just didn't like him I suppose\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know I think that 's unfair", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9916b225-34f0-4988-a46c-84a9205897d3", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWhat do you think\n\n\nCan we discuss about our presidentiables\n\n\nWhat do you think  \n\n\nCan you suggest, \n\n<$B> \n\n Wala akong alam do'n e  \n\n<$A> \n\nDon't you know about those people  one of those presidentiables\n\n<$B> \n\nI know some of them\n\n<$A> \n\nUh you know some of them\n\n\nHow about you Pam\n\n<$C> \n\nI know some of them\n\n<$A> \n\nUh you know some of them but in my case uh I only know some but among them are Pimentel Estrada Enrile Defensor and, maybe Cory herself and  \n\n\nUh then, these people, maybe they have their own they have their own intentions to run for candidacy for this this this coming nineteen ninety-two elections, \n\n\n  What  do you think\n\n<$B> \n\n But   \n\n\nBut I don't think uh, they will be a good president\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n\nHow about you\n\n\nHow about you Pam\n\n\nDo you think that all of or each one of them will become a good leader something like that\n\n<$C> \n\nThere is a possibility but uh we are used to it that traditional politicians are doing the same things\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm uh these are these are the  trapos   \n\n\nWell anyway in my  in my own in my opinion I would say that uh I might be the same with what you think that there is no one of them who is capable of running for presidency because almost everyone of them has been proven to be corrupt to be something like that to be\n\n\nThey 're just using people to be their instruments that when they uhm when the election has already lapsed they don't think they don't even mind they don't even mind us anymore we voters\n\n<$C> \n\nThey just think they just think about themselves\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then   once  \n\n<$B> \n\n For   their own benefit\n\n<$A> \n\nYes that 's true and then once they are already in their position they don't even mind us what is our what are our needs and they don't even ask us right\n\n<$C> \n\nIt 's the same scenario, \n\n<$B> \n\nSo it 's better to change the  ano  \n\n<$A> \n\nYes but in my case you know what is important, there is I think this election of year nineteen ninety-two is still premature\n\n\nIn the first place we do not know yet these people who they who really they are\n\n\nAnd then what is my point there is, the first ones to change first their attitudes are those who are there in the official uh there\n\n\nI mean in the government positions because uhm like for instance no matter if we keep on electing officials we keep on choosing from them\n\n\nBut if they don't know what is basic what are the basic functions which are inherent to them I think it 's it 's useless right\n\n\nIt will be useless, \n\n\nHow about Estrada\n\n\nWhat do you think about Estrada, \n\n<$C> \n\nEstrada\n\n<$A> \n\nIs he good  \n\n\nCan you consider Estrada as a good  president\n\n<$B> \n\nHe was proven to be a good mayor  ,  but I don't think if he can be a good president\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm    \n\n\nUh-huh, well that 's also my opinion as a matter of fact even his educational attainment\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nHe has not he has not finished yet his college\n\n\nAs a matter of fact he is a drop-out from uhm M I T  and I don't believe I don't have the nerve to think that he can be a good president, \n\n\nHe can be he can be the same also but I mean he can be the same with the other pres uh past presidents but maybe in some other aspects in some other walks of life he can be different from those past past presidents\n\n\nHow about Defensor\n\n<$C> \n\nMiriam Defensor\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yeah Defensor\n\n\nYou know I like this Miriam Defensor-Santiago because aside from uh aside from being good in his uh position because when he was when she became the C I D  Commissioner, he did uh he did his uh he did his\n\n<$C> \n\nHer\n\n<$A> \n\nUh he did her best when she was in the when she was C I D Commissioner   and then when she became  \n\n<$C> \n\n And not only that  when she was a judge\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah she when she became the judge\n\n<$B> \n\nJudge she was the one giving uh death penalty\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yeah, and then, how about, \n\n<$B> \n\nSalonga\n\n<$A> \n\nSalonga yes Salonga Pimentel  ay  \n\n<$B> \n\nThey are traditional politicians\n\n<$A> \n\nYes they are traditional politicians\n\n\nAnd I think they can they will just do the same with what they have done in the past\n\n\nAs a matter of fact when they do it they don't these are the people who do not uh give any importance\n\n\nJust imagine this Treaty uh the Treaty which has just been concluded last  oo  \n\n<$C> \n\nThe Treaty of Friendship\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo  the Treaty of Friendship Security and Cooperation, \n\n\nYou know the point is this this is it is it was very untimely for the Senate to kill that Treaty in the Senate \n\n Why\n\n\nBecause we don't have yet uh enough capital, we don't have yet enough money to build or or to build and to stand on our own feet \n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n\nOwn feet\n\n<$A> \n\nYes as a matter of fact uh it was there that according to the Senators who have rejected this uh Treaty that uh we can stand we can now stand and we can be very independent\n\n\nYes anyway we are independent you know the point is uhm we are not independent from our own  from our own uh from our own   race  \n\n<$C> \n\n From our own country   \n\n<$A> \n\nYes from our own country but we are already independent from the other countries\n\n\nWe we are no longer administered we are no longer we are no longer manipulated or whatever\n\n\nIt is it is us because they themselves are uhm uh I mean they themselves are doing it that they are being manipulated by those people they are the ones that they are making that Filipinos are being manipulated but they are the ones being instrumented isn't it\n\n<$B> \n\nIn fairness to uh, the Senators the twelve Senators\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh what they are fighting for here is that uh the the content of the Treaty   is not  clear\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd the the figure the figure over the payment you know it is not clearly stated in the Treaty\n\n\nThat is one of the thing that they are fighting for of not uh of not do, of not uh what what do you call this uh of not signing this Treaty\n\n<$A> \n\nYes have not signed have not approved   it , \n\n<$C> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nBut somehow it uh it would help us if they approve the Treaty\n\n<$A> \n\nYes I do believe also if they if they have approved this Treaty just for a while\n\n\nBut there 's   if they have given it  at least ten years   or  at least less than ten years or ten years\n\n<$C> \n\n At least ten years   \n\n\n Uh   \n\n\nTen years\n\n<$A> \n\nYes it would be a good it would be a great help to the   Filipino people  \n\n<$C> \n\n Filipino   yes\n\n<$A> \n\n  Because  \n\n<$C> \n\n Especially   the  ano  the Mount   Pinatubo  victims \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nBecause when this Mount Pinatubo erupted there were a lot of people who were affected isn't it\n\n\nThe buildings and even the  uh the Clark Airbase and this Clark Airbase is severely affected by Mount Pinatubo\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd that is why because this has been uh the that base was destroyed so we don't have the money to uh to to renovate that that building because well why oh oh I mean where are we going to get the amount\n\n\nWhere are we going to get the money to pay for the renovation of these buildings or of these buildings\n\n\nSo if these if these buildings will be converted for us to be our uh I mean part of our Philippine uh Philippine, what is that Philippine properties something like that so I think it is something that we can uh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I want to ask you\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nHow about if if we sign a treaty the twelve Senators if they signed a treaty for another ten years do you think after ten years uh we can we can uh we can what do you call that we can cut the treaty or we no longer have the treaty from the Americans\n\n\nDo you think we we can stand already after the ten years\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nAfter giving them the chance the ten years\n\n<$A> \n\nIt would be of the same case because if we cannot stand if we cannot stand after ten years if we are not sure if we are not certain with ourselves that after ten years we do not know if we can stand on our own feet how much more now\n\n<$C> \n\nYes  'no  \n\n<$A> \n\nThe fact that if we would be given uh the Americans   would be given  another ten years\n\n<$C> \n\n They are less   \n\n\n<unclear> 1 word </unclear> by the Filipinos\n\n<$A> \n\nIf ever they if ever the Senate approves it\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd   the   ano  and another problem is  ano 'yong  underemployment\n\n<$A> \n\n But   \n\n\nYeah there would be a lot of\n\n<$C> \n\nUnemployment\n\n<$A> \n\nYes, there would be a lot of things that might be affected, the economic stability not only the political stability but at the same time our social uh yes our employment our and many other things\n\n\nOkay let 's let 's point uh let 's focus on employment\n\n\nThere are more than almost two hundred thousand to two hundred thousand to five hundred thousands who are already unemployed, because of that because of that uhm, because of that rejection and because of the Mount Pinatubo eruption\n\n\nAnd then don't you don't you know that don't you hear that that some of the electronic companies nowadays are now are now I mean are now, slowly declining\n\n\nIt declines   now  because some of the electronics companies now are now starting  uh I mean terminate or not exactly terminating but they they have now the retrenchment they retrench these people who are employed because according to them they are at great loss\n\n<$C> \n\n Yes   \n\n<$A> \n\nThey they lose they lose uhm, lots of uhm products and these products are coming from U S and I believe that these products are  are are are being supported to us by the U S economy\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd it will also affect the  ano  foreign investors\n\n<$B> \n\nBut for me  'no , uh but for me the thing is the I think, uh the thing is when when we will be when we will be going to stand on our own feet and try to uh try to build our own you know our own economy like that\n\n<$C> \n\nPerhaps if we\n\n<$B> \n\nIf we if we depend too much to them\n\n<$A> \n\nWell that is also true that how can we build our own  ano  our own independence\n\n\nWell anyway the sense is the point is we already we are already independent\n\n\nWe already have it but it is it is the manner of administration\n\n\n  Actually, I do not  I do not     yes I do not condemn those twelve Senators\n\n<$C> \n\n Yes the administration   \n\n\n The leaders   \n\n<$A> \n\nI do not condemn with I do not condemn them\n\n\nIn fact I am very proud of them because at least they have the pride\n\n\nThey have their pride of nationalism patriotism and loyalty to the Philippine or loyalty to the country   to the nation  \n\n<$C> \n\n Do you believe   that it is a nationalism or patriotism or it is just a self-interest\n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe I uh because as we all know that they are politicians and politicians are good in that\n\n\nThey really they can really make everything what they want\n\n<$B> \n\nBoth of them might   have  their personal interest\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nAs a matter of fact when

many times already\n\n\nWell if you 're from Bacolod you have to face the reality that you 're going to ride a plane just by yourself\n\n<$B> \n\nReally I 've never I 've never ridden a plane alone\n\n<$A> \n\nOoohhh\n\n<$B> \n\nPromise I haven't   really  \n\n<$A> \n\n You must try   you must try it\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm scared\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah it 's really scary at first but after you 'll get

there\n\n\nI 've never been there before I 've just heard stories about it and then and then I wanna see it for myself and see if it 's really a good beach   but  I think it is\n\n<$A> \n\n  Oo    \n\n\nI pity you\n\n\nWell you have to go\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah, so if if ever you 're planning to go there this   summer  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah I 'll call   you I 'll call you\n\n<$B> \n\nTell me

malaria\n\n<$A> \n\n Are there is I don't know\n\n<$B> \n\nOutbreak there 's a malaria outbreak I think somewhere there  and I don't wanna have a malaria\n\n\nI I just came out from a German measles and then I 'm gonna have malaria isn't that too much sickness in one   year  \n\n<$A> \n\n But   I believe the beaches in Palawan are better than Boracay\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but\n\n<$A> \n\nThey 're cleaner they 're cleaner the water cleaner clearer and everything\n\n<$B> \n\nBut but at least in Boracay it 's really   a resort  \n\n<$A> \n\n Civilized   \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah the service sort type of island\n\n\nUnlike in Palawan it 's more of a forest and jungle type\n\n<$A> \n\nActually Boracay it 's, it 's like a city in a beach\n\n\nThat 's the setting it 's like a city in a beach\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then there 's night life also\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah there is yeah oh God\n\n<$B> \n\n Better in   Boracay  \n\n<$A> \n\n Night life in   Boracay is very fun\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah   and even more foreigners  \n\n<$A> \n\n And there is even   golf courses\n\n\nImagine there 's even golf courses   in the beach  \n\n<$B> \n\n And we could   meet foreigners  \n\n<$A> \n\n Ay  no,  \n\n<$B> \n\nHow about uh what was your most memorable vacation\n\n<$A> \n\nMe well I guess my most memorable vacation was when the first time I went to the States with my family\n\n\nI think I was around ten years old\n\n\nYeah I really enjoyed Disneyland Magic Mountain Knottsberry Farm and all those amusement parks\n\n\nUh yeah I remember uh, I went to I went to Lake Tahoe and that was the first time I touched the snow\n\n\nWow it was so fantastic\n\n<$B> \n\nI envy you\n\n\nI 've never seen snow and I 've never been to the States\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I guess your time will come just wait for it\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah well at least my sister went there and my Mom and my Dad except me and my brother\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy don't you go with them\n\n<$B> \n\nNo it was in different occasions I mean my Mom went there alone for   the wedding  of her sister my Dad went there   on business trip  my sister went there alone for her birthday gift in her eighteenth birthday gift\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh   \n\n\n That 's why   \n\n\nWhy don't you convince your parents to give you the money and\n\n<$B> \n\nUh we don't have the money  \n\n<$A> \n\nAs of now\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah as of now\n\n\nMaybe if I 'm  if I after I graduate when I 'm working already and I 'm earning my own money I 'll probably   visit  the States\n\n<$A> \n\n    \n\n\nYeah  \n\n\nHow about you\n\n\nWhat 's your most memorable vacation\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I guess my most memorable vacation was when I was in third year high school and we went home to our province in Romblon, \n\n\nI was with my  titas  and  titos  but they 're almost the same age in their in their early twenties during that time so they 're more of the, teenager touch but not really\n\n\nThey 're like the yuppies\n\n\nAnd then we went to our house in front in the house in front of the beach\n\n<$A> \n\nWow   it was beautiful  \n\n<$B> \n\n And it 's like   our sort of private beach because there 's nobody there just us and our house is isolated\n\n\nIt 's it it 's in it 's it 's surrounded by forests and\n\n<$A> \n\nWas it the first time that you went there\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I went there when I was still little  e    but  \n\n<$A> \n\n But   \n\n<$B> \n\nIt was the most memorable because we had fun we were we were swimming we were joking around we sleep in a hut  instead of the house we 'd sleep in the hut because we 'd tell scary stories at night before we go to sleep\n\n\nAnd then in the morning we eat  pandesal  and Milo\n\n\n Hay  those were the days\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah so sad to hear but but I guess you can do it again you can experience it again\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah   it 's been  a long time since I went back to the province\n\n<$A> \n\n But if   \n\n\nBut you know what\n\n\nIf you 're going to think of it Philippines is a lot of great places uh better than the  better than going out\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah the better than abroad\n\n\nWe 've got better   beaches  I think   and  better uh vacation spots\n\n<$A> \n\n Beach   \n\n\n Yeah   \n\n\nBut you know the problem is they 're so expensive\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah it 's it 's as expensive as going to the States almost as expensive as going to   the States  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   the rates are really expensive uhm it 's better if you 'll go to Hong Kong instead of going to Palawan\n\n\nIt 's more cheaper and that 's  that 's a reality I 'm not joking\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I know but well no not all of us get the chance to to visit every island in the Philippines every tourist spot in the Philippines so I guess it 's just, someone 's luck to go everywhere around the Philippines\n\n\nHow about you Pam\n\n<$A> \n\nI believe the you know what I believe they must give special rates for Filipinos\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nDon't you   think  \n\n<$B> \n\n Like   discount\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nDiscounted rates\n\n\nYeah because this is our country we should have been  I mean like what they 're saying we should first visit or get around our country than plan on going out abroad because the Philippines has better places to visit this week this summer time\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I guess it  the problem with the Philippines is that, most of the Filipinos still loves to go out\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah they prefer to go abroad than stay in this country not knowing that we have better places\n\n\nLike in Batangas there are many beaches which are better than those in the States\n\n\nLike my uncle who 's an American himself didn't like a beach in North Carolina I guess and he doesn't want he 's not sure of visiting the Philippines because he 's not  he doesn't want to see I mean he wants to see a beach that is very nice not like the one he saw in the States and to think he 's already an American and he 's doubting the Philippines\n\n\nI told my  tita  that she  she should bring her husband to Boracay or to  at least either in  even in Batangas 'cause our beaches are far better than in the States\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd, look at it Hollywood stars are going to Amanpulo\n\n\n  Imagine  going to our own beach Hollywood stars\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nYeah they 're not contented with their own and we Filipino are not contented   of what we have yeah  \n\n\nWe prefer to go, to the States to Europe\n\n<$A> \n\n Of what we have yeah   \n\n\nI guess it 's part of our mental\n\n<$B> \n\nMentality\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah   so  \n\n<$B> \n\n So   we want to be like others like the foreigners we, we think that it 's more, prestigious or something\n\n<$A> \n\nI guess it 's uh it 's the effect of our colonial mentality\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah you can say it <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's really sad\n\n<$B> \n\nHey how will we by the way will we how will we do our solicitations for ESA  this summer\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I guess we have to meet first with the ESA with the other ESA officials and after that we should arrange the  sponsorships packages and I guess after that we can go around Manila to get sponsors\n\n<$B> \n\nWell that 's a good idea\n\n\nYou know I really want the Euro-tour to push through next summer\n\n\nI really want to go to Europe\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's really educational\n\n\nMy Mom even told me that if I let 's say if I 'll go to to Europe I should go with my friends not with my family\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah you 'll enjoy it more\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah and it 's more exciting if you 'll go with your friends and\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd besides we 're studying it\n\n\nSo it means we 'll get a a glimpse of what we 're studying of what we 're talking about in the classroom not just imagining in our minds what what does this place look like at least we can get first-hand info or first-hand picture of what\n\n<$A> \n\nWe can really feel the ambiance   of Europe  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   and when we when we go back to school in June it would be really exciting 'cause we could share stuffs that we we learned from our tour\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I hope we can go I really hope that 's why we have to work hard\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah to get sponsors\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah we have to we have to get a lot of sponsors from rich companies\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah so they could support us when we go on tour\n\n\nWhat which countries do you want to go to when we go on the Euro-tour\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I guess I want to go to Paris the usual things\n\n<$B> \n\nIn France\n\n<$A> \n\nI want to go to Paris France uhm Greece also I like to go to Greece\n\n<$B> \n\nSpain\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah Spain yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nYou 're studying Spanish you should want to go to Spain and   wanna practice our language  \n\n<$A> \n\n And I think   we can apply   our  Spanish language\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nEven though we 're not that fluent   but  at least we 'll get\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nWe know something I mean we know the basics\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah that 's good\n\n<$B> \n\nHow about Germany you wanna go to Germany\n\n<$A> \n\nOh my Dad said Germany is also a great place\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I wanna I wanna see those old castles but you know and look at them  kasi  it was really my dream while when I was a little kid to see a castle and act like a princess and everything\n\n<$A> \n\nBut you know in Europe everywhere   there 's castles  \n\n<$B> \n\n There 's castles   yeah I know\n\n\nHow about Belgium\n\n\nYou wanna go to Belgium\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I not that much but I prefer going to Paris and the places I mentioned\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah me I want to go to Belgium because my aunt is there\n\n\nShe 's a nun she 's a missionary nun so\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy don't you tell her we 'll visit\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah actually she 's been waiting for it\n\n\nI I told her about it even  way

right\n\n\nNo I don't like  pomelo  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh I love it\n\n<$B> \n\nReally\n\n<$A> \n\nBut, you you don't put  bagoong  with the sweet ones\n\n\nYou there was one time when uh the  pomelo  we had was yellow and it didn't taste like it was tasteless so I put  bagoong  \n\n\nIt tasted good\n\n\nIt was good actually\n\n<$B> \n\nYou 're really an adventurous eater, yeah, just say   yes  \n\n<$A> \n\n Am I   \n\n\nAm I\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I guess so  \n\n\nIf I 'm adventurous why wouldn't I eat  bagoong ay  I mean  dinuguan , \n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nOr  bopis  \n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe that 's more of ethics  \n\n\nYou don't want to eat   somebody else 's life source  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah I wouldn't want to eat   \n\n\nI 've eaten pig 's brains\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah where\n\n<$A> \n\nBut that wasn't my choice\n\n<$B> \n\n  What did it taste  like\n\n<$A> \n\n At home   \n\n\nTasteless it was tasteless\n\n\nAt first it was kinda good because it was on the,  torta  \n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nI put catsup  e  catsup again\n\n<$B> \n\nMore catsup\n\n<$A> \n\nAnyway it didn't taste like it didn't taste gross  \n\n\nIt was white and squishy\n\n<$B> \n\nIt didn't look like brain\n\n<$A> \n\nIt didn't I didn't know what brain what brains look like\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I guess so\n\n<$A> \n\nSo and then I kept on eating and eating and then after, how many spoonfuls of that my brother tells me that I 'm eating pig 's brain\n\n\nThat was gross\n\n\nI wanted to\n\n<$B> \n\nBarf\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah well, but of course my Mom told me to eat everything, \n\n<$B> \n\nNot to   waste food  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yuck   \n\n\nYeah yeah not to waste food\n\n<$B> \n\nI hate it when they do that when they trick you\n\n\nJust last Saturday they tried to trick me into eating frog 's legs\n\n\nI think my guardian angel was really watching over me because it was unavailable  \n\n<$A> \n\nFrog 's legs\n\n\n  That 's  good\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nI don't know I I can't imagine eating frog 's legs\n\n\nI 'd rather uh dissect it  \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I I, I don't wanna dissect them it 's they 're gross\n\n\nI don't wanna even touch them but I can eat them  \n\n\nI eat them it 's, delicious\n\n<$B> \n\nThey say that it tastes like chicken but I I still can't imagine\n\n\nI mean I just imagine all those warts\n\n<$A> \n\nActually it 's better than chicken\n\n<$B> \n\nAll those warts and the slime and nggghhh\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat\n\n\nThey don't cook that\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but still the legs belong to the same frog\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I guess it 's just that ever since I was a child I 've been eating   frogs  \n\n<$B> \n\n Frog 's   legs\n\n<$A> \n\nFrog 's legs\n\n<$B> \n\nBut have you tried  bayawak  \n\n\nThat 's one thing   I 've tried once  \n\n<$A> \n\n Aeh   \n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's okay it tastes like roast  ,  pork \n\n<$A> \n\n Yuck   \n\n\nYuck\n\n\nI can't I can't\n\n\nI keep on thinking about those  bayawaks  roaming around our garden , \n\n\nI 'm, \n\n\nYuck\n\n<$B> \n\nNo but I I don't know\n\n\nAt first I was pretty repelled but after awhile I just took the image out of my head and then I ate it\n\n\nI don't know\n\n\nIt tastes good with  toyo  \n\n\nAt least that masked the weird uhm aftertaste but it was okay\n\n<$A> \n\nPhew\n\n<$B> \n\nOne thing I couldn't eat\n\n<$A> \n\nHorse meat\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat\n\n\nNo I 've never been served that\n\n\nTurtle turtle soup\n\n\nIt was in a Chinese restaurant\n\n\nNo offense\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean\n\n<$A> \n\nUh, Chinese restaurants they cook everything for aphrodisiac or something\n\n<$B> \n\nI know\n\n\nThey even cook rat\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd yuck\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah in Hong Kong they serve that\n\n<$A> \n\nSnakes\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah they were offering snake 's blood as a drink in that same Chinese restaurant\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd that   same kind  of stuff huh\n\n<$A> \n\n Snakes you tried   \n\n\nWhat about snake bile\n\n\nWhat about snake uh-huh you 'll get poisoned  \n\n\n Rattlesnake 's bile  \n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's gross, \n\n\nYeah but I think it 's really true that they cook everything, \n\n\nBut, what 's that  crunchy  wherein they they serve insects, \n\n\nI know they do 'cause it was featured in this newspaper\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't think, I don't know, but I know here in the Philippines in Pampanga or Pangasinan they serve insects\n\n<$B> \n\nInsects like locusts\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean locusts are fine but in that foreign   restaurant  \n\n<$A> \n\n Beetles   \n\n<$B> \n\nBeetles cockroach\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's gross\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm if I remember correctly there were, uhm ant candies there used to be ant candies in China\n\n<$B> \n\nIn China\n\n<$A> \n\nOr somewhere in Asia\n\n<$B> \n\nNext thing you 'll know there 'll be chocolate-covered ants   chocolate-  covered cockroaches\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\nThey did that already\n\n<$A> \n\nI think so  \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd you didn't put your catsup back on them\n\n<$A> \n\nHey and this reminds me of uhm what movie was that Indiana Jones \n\n<$B> \n\nWhich one, \n\n<$A> \n\nTemple of Doom \n\n<$B> \n\nThe one where he was eating monkey brain\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\n Ngiii  \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd and the soup that looked like tomato soup was actually monkey 's eyeballs\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah those were the   food  they need\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nAnd then there was a huge\n\n<$B> \n\nIs that the one\n\n<$A> \n\nThere 's a huge snake and inside of it were smaller  snakes   smaller    \n\n<$B> \n\n     \n\n<$A> \n\nSnakes I mean\n\n<$B> \n\nOh my God\n\n<$A> \n\nYuck\n\n<$B> \n\nFunny how those people think of different ways to present food in more groceries\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah, \n\n\nIf you were offered to eat if you had nothing to eat and you only had, let 's say, what what 's gross\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know you asked\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm, snake would you\n\n<$B> \n\nIf I was really desperate\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\n Hindi  uhm as long as they didn't tell me what it was I 'd feel <unclear> 1 word </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nBut if you were if you were aware that it was a snake would you\n\n<$B> \n\nProbably not   unless  \n\n<$A> \n\n Even   if you 're really hungry really starved\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'd rather die  \n\n<$A> \n\nEven if it 's a matter of life   and death  \n\n<$B> \n\n And death   \n\n\nWell if it 's for medicinal purposes yeah I guess so\n\n\nAnd that was the only fare I could eat   uhm be  \n\n<$A> \n\n Medicinal purposes   \n\n<$B> \n\nEat the snake okay fine at least they look clean  \n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThey do especially the fat ones\n\n<$A> \n\nThe fat ones\n\n\n  That  I 'll buy  na  one\n\n<$B> \n\n At least   \n\n\nAt least you 're sure they have meat you know and besides they eat chickens so if they eat chicken  \n\n<$A> \n\nWhat about cats\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I really can't imagine eating cat even in    siopao   \n\n<$A> \n\n You you   you you 're just gonna imagine that you 're eating your pet\n\n<$B> \n\nYes  \n\n\nI mean all nine of them  \n\n\nI mean after taking care of so many cats stray cats I don't think you can bear to eat one\n\n<$A> \n\nDogs\n\n<$B> \n\nNo especially the cute ones no\n\n<$A> \n\nYou 're eating your best friend  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah  \n\n\nWhat a cannibalism  \n\n\nSounds so weird\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm could, what if uhm you were a doctor told you that you had to drink your urine to, uh to uh get healed from a disease\n\n<$B> \n\nDoes   that really  happen\n\n<$A> \n\n Or something   \n\n\nI don't know\n\n\nI don't believe in it because I know that urine is, \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah  eh  \n\n<$A> \n\nNot clean\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's ammonia and,   something  else\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nYeah salt", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nHi uhm you still remember the topic we discussed last time\n\n<$B> \n\n  On  \n\n<$A> \n\n About   why, bad things happen to   good people  \n\n<$B> \n\n Good people   \n\n<$A> \n\nI read about this article, concerning, the  the oft-quoted statement \" nice guys finish last \" \n\n\nDo you agree to this\n\n<$B> \n\nNice guys finish last\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich means that\n\n<$A> \n\nThat if you 're good you finish last\n\n<$B> \n\nYou die last\n\n<$A> \n\n Not necessarily\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat I 'm trying to say is you don't get the goods, you don't, deliver the bacon so to speak,   because  you 're good\n\n<$B> \n\n I think so   \n\n\nWhich in the opposite what  what happens to bad people\n\n<$A> \n\nOf course we can say that uhm, because of, okay we cannot say that we can attribute the luck or the fortunes of a person to his being good, \n\n\nWould you agree with that\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nMeaning uh because you 're good then, fate would be\n\n<$B> \n\nGood to you\n\n<$A> \n\nGood to you\n\n\nBe kind to you, \n\n\nSo that 's why uh just like the Jews, uh during the time of Moses\n\n\nPerhaps, they often asked the question why didn't God honor us by giving us the  wind  \n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy were why why did God allow them to go through\n\n<$B> \n\nSeveral trials\n\n<$A> \n\nSeveral trials persecutions uh, sufferings\n\n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\n Hindi  I think according to that\n\n<$A> \n\nArticle\n\n<$B> \n\nArticle, to strengthen their faith\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you  meaning God has to test them\n\n<$B> \n\nI think so\n\n<$A> \n\nGod has to, put you to test to just to, test  uh okay just to   know  to determine whether you are for him or not\n\n<$B> \n\n Determine   \n\n\nI think so  that 's love\n\n<$A> \n\nYou call that love\n\n<$B> \n\nYes, \n\n\nWould you not want to be put to a test\n\n\nWould you not want, the other person your loved one to be put into test before you could call it that feeling love\n\n<$A> \n\nPerhaps that would be alright if the relationship is between two human beings\n\n<$B> \n\nA man or a woman\n\n<$A> \n\nOr a man and a woman between a man and a woman but not between God and man\n\n<$B> \n\nBut\n\n<$A> \n\nDefinitely there is a big disparity between the Creator and His creation\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd and I I could also assume that there is also a disparity between the love that they both feel\n\n\nThen I could also say that that 's a different love in the first place\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich cannot be compared to or equated to the love that a woman feels for   a man  \n\n<$A> \n\n What I 'm   trying to drive at is that uh, a hit would not be fair to require\n\n<$B> \n\nA man\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yes a man uh having an infinite love for God when God is capable of feeling an infinite love for his creation\n\n<$B> \n\nBut\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause because of what man experiences what man suffers or the sufferings that man uhm uhm experiences\n\n\nThe sufferings he goes through the supper sufferings   persecutions  \n\n<$B> \n\n Same with any   relationship\n\n\nIt 's the same with any relationship right, \n\n\nIt can be equated with a relationship between a man and a woman and a relationship with God in a sense that both relationships experience, trials sufferings, both relationships\n\n<$A> \n\nBut you okay but would you agree with me that God knows everything\n\n<$B> \n\nYes of course\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay because of this capacity of God knowing everything of of course corollary to that is the power of God to of the power of God of of uh doing anything because it carries along with it the power to, do anything\n\n\nRight\n\n\nThe power of knowing carries along with it the power of doing   because  of his being God\n\n<$B> \n\n So   \n\n\nSo\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay would you agree with me with that premise, \n\n\nHe 's capable of doing anything\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay \n\n Because of that power then why still allow why would God still allow\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat happens to   free will  \n\n<$A> \n\n To the creation   to the to His creation because He loves  very much His creation like man\n\n\nWhy would He still allow man to\n\n<$B> \n\nSuffer\n\n<$A> \n\nTo suffer\n\n\nWhy test when you know for a fact that man is weak\n\n\nBecause of the inherent weakness of man okay the argument would be\n\n<$B> \n\nThen you tell God God why why does \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay your argument would be because of free will\n\n\nGod granted us free will\n\n\nTo choose between right   or wrong  \n\n<$B> \n\n And wrong   \n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n\nBut why still allow that to happen when you can very well direct man your creation because of your infinite love for your creation to do everything good\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's a test\n\n\nIt 's a trial\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy test\n\n\nWhy allow that\n\n\nBecause of your goodness right\n\n\nGod\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy not\n\n<$A> \n\nGod loves us   and  God\n\n<$B> \n\n Okay   \n\n\nAre you claiming that anyone who is good should not be put into test\n\n<$A> \n\nI think so why not\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy\n\n<$A> \n\nLike for example in your case if say you have a friend you very well know or you have all the capacity ability to, uh guide him guide him and uh make him do things which are good\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nWould you still test   him  to do things \n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nYes to determine whether he has learned or not\n\n<$A> \n\nLearned what\n\n\nHe knows very well the difference between good and   bad  \n\n<$B> \n\n No   but you said I am directing him\n\n\nSo this person is a human being\n\n\nHe has the  the the tendencies   to commit  mistakes\n\n<$A> \n\n Okay   \n\n\nWhat 's the purpose\n\n\n  What  is the purpose of testing him\n\n<$B> \n\n To   \n\n<$A> \n\nJust to determine his loyalty the extent   of his loyalty  \n\n<$B> \n\n No   whether he has learned or not\n\n\nYou know mistakes make us strong, mistakes bring us closer to God\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah that 's why my my question here my question here is the relationship between man and God\n\n<$B> \n\nCorrect\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy would still God allow man to be tested or why would He test man\n\n<$B> \n\nMy question is why not\n\n\nWhy not put him to test\n\n\nThat 's that 's God 's love for a man\n\n<$A> \n\nNo because if if the love I feel if the love that I think God feels for man is so what how would I describe it\n\n<$B> \n\nSo infinite\n\n<$A> \n\nSo infinite okay infinite so pure\n\n\nThere is no condition whatsoever because of his love for man right\n\n\n  Because  that is man is His creation okay\n\n\nHe would not want definitely he would not want man to perish to commit to commit any sin right\n\n\nOkay but why still allow man to do bad things to transgress to to sin\n\n\nWhy not just\n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n  That 's his choice  \n\n<$A> \n\n Why not   just remove sin\n\n\nWhy not just remove sin and let man do good things\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay to answer that  question if you cannot commit a mistake how will you know right from wrong\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nIf you cannot, make a sin how will you know that you haven't committed one\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you mean to tell me uh what presupposes goodness is badness\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I   think so  \n\n<$A> \n\n What   presupposes uhm good or being kind being good being beautiful is or are\n\n<$B> \n\nOther other people 's   or your  \n\n<$A> \n\n  the opposite   \n\n<$B> \n\nYes   other people 's or your  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh so you mean to tell me that   goodness cannot possibly exist without sin without badness\n\n<$B> \n\nYes because you won't be able to determine one\n\n<$A> \n\nIs that so\n\n<$B> \n\nHow will you know that this is correct\n\n<$A> \n\n  Uh-huh  \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh   because you have a basis for such\n\n\nBecause the other one is wrong then this must be right\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n\nHow will you know that you have committed a sin\n\n\nUh because I have done a good deed\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's why I knew\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what do you think is the opposite of God\n\n\nThe opposite of God is the devil\n\n<$B> \n\nI think so\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so, uhm what presupposes God is a devil\n\n\nThere would be no God if there is no devil\n\n\nYou mean to tell me we would not we cannot appreciate God because there is no devil\n\n\nOr we appreciate God because there is a devil\n\n<$B> \n\nI think so\n\n<$A> \n\nOh, really\n\n<$B> \n\nI think so\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\n  So so the  \n\n<$B> \n\n You know that God   existed because He kept you away from sin, \n\n<$A> \n\nBut my question is, uh did God already or is  is God already in existence, even prior to sin\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nOr did they exist simultaneously\n\n<$B> \n\nNo God existed prior to sin\n\n<$A> \n\nPrior to sin\n\n\nAnd sin was a product of what man 's transgression\n\n<$B> \n\nI think so\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause of God 's uh granting man free will\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause of that grant of free will, what was born was sin\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nLook uh when Adam and Eve were left at the Garden of Eden they knew that what they 're doing are all correct\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUntil such time that that evil entered into their minds\n\n\nIt was introduced to them right\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay, and then\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's why they were able to determine that, what they did was wrong\n\n<$A> \n\nOh but God could have prevented uh could have   prevented them from  committing   wrong  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yes yes   \n\n\n In fact   he prevented them\n\n<$A> \n\nNo he tried he tried to prevent but He still allowed He allowed sin to creep into and attract   or test  \n\n<$B> \n\n He didn't try   \n\n\nHe prevented them remember He said uh you can you are free to eat \n\n<$A> \n\nPrecisely because of that free will\n\n\nThat was free will in itself\n\n<$B> \n\nYes but then the evil was   so  \n\n<$A> \n\n He   could have destroyed beforehand that the the tree\n\n<$B> \n\nBut He didn't allow it\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause He wanted man to realize that okay you want to do what you want then bear with it   then suffer  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI have given you enough\n\n\nFor you to be able to determine what is right and what is wrong \n\n<$A> \n\nYou mean to tell me that uh   God  was trying to teach Adam and Eve they He was trying to teach them Adam and Eve uh His  His existence by allowing them to choose between Him between between God and   this what you call this  the the devil\n\n<$B> \n\n Wait   \n\n\n No it 's a choice   \n\n\nIt 's a choice uhm being able to determine because in their case they know that everything is happy everything is given free  but they realized that after they have eaten or committed the sin and then they were able to determine what is right from wrong\n\n\nThe same with us\n\n\nWe 're given free will\n\n\nWe 're given two choices all the time\n\n\nThere is no neutral just positive or negative\n\n<$A> \n\nBut what I 'm trying to drive at is why did He still allow evil to exist\n\n<$B> \n\nI cannot   answer  \n\n<$A> \n\n He could have   just destroyed evil\n\n<$B> \n\n  I cannot answer His  existence\n\n<$A> \n\n He could have destroyed   \n\n\nNo why He could have destroyed He could have removed the idea of sin\n\n<$B> \n\nThen what will happen to you\n\n\n  What will  happen to you\n\n<$A> \n\n That 's it   \n\n<$B> \n\nHow will you know that you haven't sinned\n\n\nThen what will happen\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause   there is no sin  \n\n<$B> \n\n What will you long   for\n\n\nWhat will you ask for\n\n<$A> \n\nNothing\n\n<$B> \n\nNothing\n\n<$A> \n\nYes because there is no sin\n\n<$B> \n\nThen you will never\n\n<$A>

much   \n\n\nUhm did   you see Carlos  Agassi crying\n\n<$B> \n\n What about it   \n\n\nYeah I saw Carlos crying\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat did you think about his acting\n\n<$B> \n\nHe 's so like a boy  \n\n<$A> \n\n Like a boy\n\n\nYou know the problem with him is that he really can't act\n\n\nThat 's why the tabloid says uhm that he 's like a rapper when he acts and that 's one big criticism against him\n\n<$B> \n\nI think that 's his field you know to sing to rap but   not to  \n\n<$A> \n\n Not to   act\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then they found out that Onemig is a best friend of his \n\n And then the reports are saying that he 's going to be replaced by Onemig\n\n\nHe 's going to be killed in the episode and that 's why I think he 's so pissed about that because he didn't\n\n<$B> \n\n what episode\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm the episode he 's got uh  Sa Dulo ng Walang Hanggang  you know this\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nWith with\n\n<$B> \n\nUh with   Claudine Barretto  \n\n<$A> \n\n Barretto    oo  with Barretto\n\n\nAnd I think it will be uh it would make a great impact on his finances if he stops in that show\n\n\nYou know how much  naman  they earn \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah sure\n\n\nBut why did he cry in the first place\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I don't know\n\n\nThe problem is there was a question of Onemig replacing him but then when Boy Abunda started questioning him the conversation centered on his past\n\n<$B> \n\nUh yeah I remember\n\n\nAbout his father\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Iranian father\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nWho used to beat him up  daw  quote unquote\n\n\nAnd then he even showed his scar  and then   the conversation  \n\n<$B> \n\n Scar   where\n\n<$A> \n\nOn his face\n\n<$B> \n\nUh yeah\n\n<$A> \n\n O di ba  on his cheek\n\n<$B> \n\n Oo  \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then he he was saying like uh he grew up with the maid and it was an accident\n\n\nBut then he wants his father to recognize his abilities and and and the sad the funny thing about it is because the show uh the the interview started with Boy Abunda asking him so how are you now how are you now  \n\n\n<unclear> words </unclear> he 's ready to cry my God you can see the tears at the corner of his eyes\n\n<$B> \n\nBut the one thing that I like in \" The Buzz \" you know the last time I saw \" The Buzz \" \n\n\nWhat what was that\n\n\nWhen Boy Abunda was interviewing Pops Fernandez\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yeah yeah that was\n\n<$B> \n\nThat was nice\n\n<$A> \n\nTwo two  two Sundays ago\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen  when Pops Fernandez cried\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I with that interview that was the first time that I empathized sympathized with uh Pops\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause before when he when she  when she is interviewed I hate her\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\nI uh I cannot see sincerity in   her  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh   Is that right   okay  \n\n<$B> \n\n But   during that interview with Boy Abunda the last time just recently I saw that he she was

maybe there 's one person saying, this I can't see it negative I mean they  we 're amateurs uh you know and stuff like that\n\n\nBut uh for the one we for the one we uh get negative feedback we have but ten maybe more positive feedback you know\n\n\nSo that 's all\n\n\nBut you can't please everybody you know I mean hey that 's the way it is right uh you know, \n\n\nHey what can you do you know exactly you can't please them all can you\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's true but then uhm what what we need to do probably is uh is like this\n\n\nProbably we could choose to jingle in such a way that this uh studio studio type of the jingle and uh  I well actually my friend 's gonna do is like uh he 'll make up the jingle again and he 'll uh transcribe really transcribe and then he 'll put it you know in a in a winzip rap\n\n<$B> \n\nWith\n\n<$A> \n\nZip rap and then track by track I think he 'll be recording them\n\n\nHe 'll be transferring them and uh into the studio on Wednesday like midnight and do it\n\n\nHe 'll do the rap <unclear> words </unclear> and it 's free\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah you know uh it 's a, sign to uh, really get going I mean there are there are listeners out there who like the station and it 's true we have to sort of become more you know presentable right\n\n\nNot just blah you know what I mean I think that 's enough that 's an excuse already you know\n\n\nWe don't have the time and maybe lack maybe lack of uh financial resources but uhm, we have if we 've had time to really uhm to start uhm creating uhm let 's say a <unclear> word </unclear> jingle or or whatever to make it seem more like a viable or a real uhm radio station you know\n\n\nI understand you know that you know that we could use comments or criticisms\n\n\nI oh you know what, that 'll only make us stronger you know no matter if it 's negative or positive criticism it should only make us stronger\n\n\nIt should make us try to improve ourselves and uh do better at the station and uh you know, I 'm I 'm satisfied with so far what 's going on\n\n\nUhm of course of course I wanna do much more you know before uhm before I 'm done with my thing here\n\n\nI really want a nice set-up really and uhm and uh basically whoever comes in after us you know has an easier time than us you know pioneering this stuff\n\n\nYou 've got to remember uhm this is pioneering stuff you know this is uh we 're the first college to ever have our own F M radio station not just it 's not easy you know\n\n\nYou can't just you can't mimic exactly what they do in uh other stations because they have the resources they have the technology you know\n\n\nWe we we 've worked hard to uh set certain criteria or certain uh uh protocol to to be a to be you know to to maximize uhm to be effective\n\n\nBut uh you know I 'm, I 'm satisfied with what 's going on you know but of course there 's so much so much more room for improvement\n\n\nI mean, we we 're we 're just only beginning you know\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's true and probably and the thing is uhm we 're doing we 're doing good now and, the the booboos that we that we uh  commit uh before is is part of it first time thing you know first time we lose\n\n\nNow I think I could probably I could probably say that uhm we 've gone far away from what we had before\n\n\nAnd you know I I 've talked to Mr Marasigan a while ago and uhm and he told me that uhm well the station should like uh the station is quite good compared to before\n\n\nSo it 's you know booboos and the mistakes you know we made we got those uh bad air times sort of things like that right\n\n\nWell uhm more of that well the thing that I got a feedback that we 're not amateurs, \n\n\nWell what I think about that is that we 're really amateurs\n\n\nWe don't we don't get paid with this right\n\n\nThat 's why we 're we 're still amateurs\n\n\nProfessionals do get paid and we 're lucky to be the first uhm college or university to be to get an L M an F M band\n\n\nIt 's the first time in the Philippines I think\n\n<$B> \n\nOh  absolutely\n\n\nYou know I I think that uh the difference between professionals and amateurs has been simply cash flow\n\n\nWe don't have the money and uh with that in mind we 've had to you know be basic but you know we were able to uhm minimize uh minimize losses maximize gains\n\n\nAnd uh you know with that I I I I 've been really uhm you know happy even proud you know that uh that uh stuff has turned out the way it has\n\n\nYou know where we 're trying we 're trying to be professional in the in the office you know and that 's the place where we should be professional and uhm and outside you know we can be friends or whatever\n\n\nThat 's fine I think people have been able to start really now to divide uh personal and professionalism\n\n\nThat 's very important I think amongst the group\n\n\nSo you know things have gotten better\n\n\nOf course I can't say it 's been perfect\n\n\nWe 've had some rock rocky times you know and uhm some things going on here but uh I 'm glad to say that we were able to work things out and uh in the end you know we all have to remember that we 're a team\n\n\nIt 's not about just one of us one part of the of the of the body we 're a complete body and we work best when we all function function well you know\n\n\nSo uhm you 've got never mind you know it 's it 's it 's just uhm, it 's just getting better I mean I can't I can't see us going down anyway\n\n\nI mean I mean we 're just gonna  flung  one uhm upper and up uh I I 'm really confident that uh we 're gonna get more listeners and get more attention that 's uh they probably out of the <unclear> word </unclear> entry\n\n\nYou know we 've been known already and uh no matter no matter if it 's positive or negative we 're making noise you know that 's the point\n\n\nThat 's how we want to do you know\n\n\nWe have to capture them like before but if it were if it we 're causing a stir that makes people talk\n\n\nHey why not you know any publicity is good publicity even if it 's bad so  that 's what I can say about that\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat I think is that uh  \n\n\nWhy are you laughing\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\n Ha  \n\n\nYou 're all good, \n\n\nI guess that uhm, we should we should like uhm, \n\n\nOh here 's this thing uhm we should like probably uhm, get some more uhm advertisement not really advertisements but then some more promotions for our radio station 'cause sometimes you know and then know there was this one time,  at band camp , you know that movie  no no no\n\n<$B> \n\nI know exactly the movie you 're talking about but we won't mention it right now\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know exactly the movie\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I know what it is\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat is it come on\n\n<$B> \n\nI know the flute  yes  and I didn't know anyway basically thanks for bringing that up\n\n\nI 'm curious about \" American Pie \" \n\n<$A> \n\nI was I was doing a line actually\n\n<$B> \n\nUh okay\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yeah there was this like a while ago there was this uhm classmate of mine she was in the what 's this INTEORG  classmate of mine\n\n\nShe she goes like and said uhm I go like about did you hear the radio station and she said oh you have a radio station, \n\n\nShe goes like oh I didn't know that \n\n\nI said yeah we have it it 's it 's like eighty-nine point five \n\n\nOh by the way O D B why did you transfer from eighty-seven to eighty-nine point five\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm as far as as I know I remember Sir explaining that uhm the frequency anything below eighty-eight is considered emerging frequencies and uh uh this does not exist like on the radio dial for some strange reasons\n\n\nSo like uh when Sir went to the N T C  to discuss it they explained to him that and uh then we had to make our change\n\n\nYou know from eighty-eight point seven but strangely enough someone else 's already there I mean I believe right\n\n\nSo uhm like adjust eighty-nine point five you know I I mean we 're we 're the new boys now eighty-nine point one eighty-nine point nine but uh it 's it 's been okay\n\n\nSo far so good\n\n\nUh you know I might have considered so about other stations maybe are trying to turn out our signal or or what\n\n\nI don't know I 'm sure but uh since it 's been okay it 's been what it 's been a while now it 's been some time now\n\n\nUhm but concerning about uh the uh, the ads and the promotion uhm I think the main the main  the main problem is that uh when when they when they decided to develop this project and uh whatever uhm, they did not think about the bigger picture\n\n\nLike months it 's finished where where it will be in outlets for the students and teachers to actually you know enjoy and listen to it\n\n\nAnd strangely enough we 've had to go on to canvass and discuss with certain uh avenues like uh uh the canteen and uh that 's why I really uh uhm not that uh it angers me but it it irks me kind of thing you know", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source":

environmental-friendly I mean\n\n<$B> \n\n   Environment   \n\n<$A> \n\n Because   \n\n\nYeah, yeah yeah because I 'm not that environmental-friendly okay so I think I need someone who should teach me how\n\n<$B> \n\nYou 're you 're saying like you want someone who 's not like who 's not you uh is that what you mean\n\n<$A> \n\nNot really but, I think I want, a person who would teach me the things that I don't know  ,  and I still have to learn, \n\n<$B> \n\n Know   \n\n\nOkay and what else\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm, of course I want  I want I want him to be physically attractive okay but if I can't get I expect I can't have it all then, I 'll settle for\n\n<$B> \n\nSomeone who 's not that\n\n<$A> \n\nThat\n\n<$B> \n\nGood-looking\n\n<$A> \n\nLooking yeah\n\n\nBut his uhm his values are quite okay and uhm he 'll love me for who and what I am the way I should love him for who or what he is\n\n\nHow about you\n\n<$B> \n\nWith what you 've said earlier when you said someone who 's not that good-looking, you know what for me\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah   I don't  \n\n<$B> \n\n I think   I want someone who 's presentable  you know like  when I go to parties or to any family gathering I can be proud of him\n\n\nHe 's properly dressed\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nHe talks really well\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd he communicates well with other people\n\n\nI want someone smart\n\n<$A> \n\nSmart\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I can I can, I can, \n\n<$A> \n\nTalk to him\n\n<$B> \n\nNo uh yeah I can talk to him\n\n<$A> \n\nAny topic at all\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah and, he can relate to other people\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nHe knows what he 's saying, and also I want someone who can love me more than I love him\n\n<$A> \n\nWell that 's what most women  say\n\n\nOkay uhm but how about education\n\n<$B> \n\nAs much as possible I want him to be, a college graduate or even he has a masteral degree\n\n<$A> \n\nOh my God   Sir  our teacher is quite you know  \n\n<$B> \n\n Well   \n\n\nWell  uh-huh no comment\n\n\nAnyway, any yeah I want someone\n\n<$A> \n\nWho 's extra cute\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean not, not only that he graduated from from a particular university but I want him you know educated as in the real sense of the word\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I think I can understand you because there are some educated people who really have the values and the character of a pig\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah yeah  \n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I also want someone who 's understanding uhm but I 'm a career woman, and in the in the future I want to work I want to and not to stay at home\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I think I think what you 're saying is that your husband or your ideal man will allow you to be yourself and to achieve what you want   in  life\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah because that 's what I also think that 's what I think I want to be\n\n\nSo what else\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat\n\n<$A> \n\nOh no it 's raining\n\n<$B> \n\nI know I know I know\n\n<$A> \n\nSo anyway we   have  to continue with the conversation\n\n<$B> \n\n Anyway   \n\n\nUh uh again I want a guy, who my family will love, \n\n\nThere are some guys that your family they cannot they cannot they   cannot  \n\n<$A> \n\n Relate   \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah they cannot love him because they feel something bad\n\n\nOr I said this to you before, uhm I think one of my uh one of one of my teachers said or one of our teachers said  that you shouldn't  huh uhm  \n\n<$A> \n\nMarry\n\n<$B> \n\nYou shouldn't marry at a at a young age\n\n<$A> \n\nAt a young age yeah\n\n<$B> \n\n Kasi  them, a guy uhm at the age of like early twenties and mid-twenties they 're like quote unquote playful  \n\n\n  You know  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh yeah   yeah I think yeah I think I remember that, uhm, what I have I have a friend who told me that you know I I I was shocked when I hear this because uhm he 's a guy and he told us girls that we should like you know\n\n<$B> \n\n  Play around  \n\n<$A> \n\n Collect   and collect then select  \n\n<$B> \n\n Ah talaga  \n\n<$A> \n\nMy God yeah I mean maybe not really play around but you know like if if you 're not  if you 're not satisfied with this kind of relationship and with this kind of guy\n\n<$B> \n\nThen get out of it   of that relationship  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah just get out of   the relationship and then find another or if you 're still ready\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n<$B> \n\nBut not like two girls at the same   I won't take it  anymore\n\n<$A> \n\n My God no   \n\n\nNo of course   not  \n\n<$B> \n\n I don't   like those kind of guys\n\n\nDo you think a guy can like you met this guy and, you have no idea that you know he has this kind of attitude that he 's playful  and I want to use that word I like it\n\n<$A> \n\n I can see that  \n\n<$B> \n\nYou you met this guy and for for you he 's \n\n\nOkay here 's this situation he 's he 's handsome you know at first glance he looks so ideal\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nBut the  you there are hearsay  na

it for yourself\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I think I think I have to get to know the person first before I really really should judge him or in the first place I have no I have no uh I have not the right I don't have the right to judge that person because he I did I don't know him and he doesn't know me right\n\n\nBut if ever I 'll get to know him and then maybe I can tell what kind of person   he is  \n\n<$B> \n\n He is   \n\n<$A> \n\nBut I don't have the right to judge him, based on on what other people say\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know if you can relate with what I 'm going to say but I like a guy who 's like my Dad  \n\n<$A> \n\nI think I think you know I think   uhm  \n\n<$B> \n\n You can relate   \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah  yeah yeah yeah yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nDo you agree with what I said\n\n<$A>

irritates me when oh  the smell of of cigarettes I don't like it\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm, I 'm going to teach you one term\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat\n\n<$A> \n\nFrom, the P M A\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat\n\n<$A> \n\n Scub  \n\n<$B> \n\nWhat 's that\n\n<$A> \n\nCigarette\n\n<$B> \n\n Scub  \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah and then\n\n<$B> \n\nDoes that refer to cigarette\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah from there yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay  scub  \n\n<$A> \n\nSo if you 're a smoker they 're gonna call you  scubbard  \n\n<$B> \n\n  Yuck  \n\n<$A> \n\n And   it 's really bad for the ears\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah, smoker  scubbard  my gosh, \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I don't want guys who are who have many vices\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean I mean it 's   okay  to have occasional occasional drinks like that\n\n<$B> \n\n Occasional   \n\n<$A> \n\nBut I don't want them to be a, drunkard  \n\n\nWhat 's that drunkard drunk\n\n<$B> \n\nDrunk, I guess  \n\n<$A> \n\nGuess, okay\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat else, \n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI want a guy who is God God-fearing\n\n<$A> \n\nGod-fearing\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nGod-fearing or a, person who has a godly devotion something like that\n\n<$B> \n\nBoth\n\n<$A> \n\nBoth, I think both goes together\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah and also lastly I want a guy who has a sense of humor\n\n<$A> \n\nUh   yeah  \n\n<$B> \n\n I don't   want any dull moment when we 're together\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah  \n\n<$B> \n\nThere are just guys who who don't know what what to say and, I want a guy who 's funny\n\n<$A> \n\nWho 's funny yeah but not   humorous  okay\n\n<$B> \n\n Not   \n\n\nYeah  \n\n<$A> \n\nI know the difference you know   I think  I know the difference\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nI like  pero , \n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay uhm for me, I think my ideal guy should be passionate\n\n<$B> \n\n   Ay   \n\n<$A> \n\n You know   yeah because because if he 's not passionate about something then how can he be passionate about me right\n\n<$B> \n\nPassionate in the  \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah right and and what 's the most important thing is that, he should have love,   lots  of love to give\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nBecause I mean love encompasses everything and\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd if he 's like and he 's like not educated or if he 's not if he 's not uhm good or if he 's not any any bad any bad attitude uhm I think, love is the catalyst that would make everybody change for the better right\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay you 're right but for me even if such a even if a guy is educated he 's really good-looking and he he seems to be everything\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nA guy who doesn't love me for what and who I am is nothing, \n\n\nAnd don't you think uhm both our concepts of an ideal man is is in this one song which goes something like uhm   you 've got to\n\n<$A&$B> \n\nLove me  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A&$B> \n\n  The way I am for simply being me   \n\n<$A> \n\nLet 's finish this  \n\n<$A&$B> \n\n  Don't love me for what you intend the hope that I might be if you 're only using me to feed your fantasy you 're really not in love so let me go I must be free   \n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's just so sad thinking that there 're only a few men left in this world who has all the qualities of an ideal man our ideal man\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm actually I don't think that all that qualities you 're looking for\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay some  \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay okay okay yeah\n\n\nYou know that 's true because times change people change and, it 's clich\u00e9 but it 's true you know like change is constant part of our lives\n\n\nBut you know since change is a  change is a constant thing I think, our concept of idealism or our concept of ideal man changes with the time or it just depends on the people\n\n<$B> \n\nYou meet\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah, yeah yeah yeah right and uh, but sometimes since we can't have our ideal man we have to like not I 'm not going to say settle for what you have because because I think that 's really crap\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's crap\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's crap that 's uh it 's really crappy thing to say\n\n<$B> \n\nBut don't you think if you 're if you 're like with this special someone\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIf it even if he has he does not have\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThe ideal qualities you you want in a guy\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYou just have I think you just have to recognize the qualities the best qualities that he has and you

first\n\n\nBut as we go along we 're able to improve ourselves\n\n\nYeah  \n\n<$B> \n\nWell, I guess practice makes perfect huh\n\n\nOh by the way uhm, did you stay in school last Friday for the celebration of our being the champion\n\n<$A> \n\nUnfortunately no\n\n\nI had to go home right away\n\n\nHow about you\n\n\nDid you stay\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I was so tired then that I want to sleep and

game  really exciting\n\n<$B> \n\nAt first I couldn't I couldn't shout\n\n\nI mean, when at during the first half\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm we 're way ahead of the F E U  \n\n\nBut then on the second half, I can't control myself  \n\n\nI 'm so nervous that I 'm afraid that we 'll  going to lose\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah and, but you know, it was a bit unexpected because I 'm not really a basketball fan\n\n\nBut I actually had fun watching it\n\n\nIt was really exciting\n\n\nAnd I was actually screaming and shouting and everything\n\n<$B> \n\nDid you know that I almost lost my voice because of the shouting and my hands were kind of getting red because of clapping\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n\nYeah my hands also they were itchy  red from clapping\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I 'm so glad that we became the champions because at last even before I graduate or we graduate we were able to, I mean, uhm enjoy the,   victory  the long awaited   victory  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah    \n\n\n Victory   \n\n<$B> \n\nOh by the way, did you hear the new policy that we 're asked to wear our I D 's in  inside the school premises\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I heard about that\n\n\nUh Atty Cruz\n\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nWas it\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah she went to our class and she announced about that policy\n\n\nSo what do you think about it\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nUhm personally I don't want to wear I D 's inside the school\n\n\nIt 's just like, I 'm in uh high school, just like wearing ID 's letting to know everybody who you are I mean just like that and everything\n\n\nI don't know but if it 's for our safety then I 'm for it\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I agree with you\n\n\nBut then, uhm I I 'm a bit embarrassed by my I D, because it 's already in uh well bad condition  \n\n\nIt 's covered with tape and everything  \n\n<$B> \n\nWell, mine is still in good shape\n\n\nBut then, I 'm ashamed to show my picture during my first year in college\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy what 's wrong with your picture\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I just don't feel like showing it to, the people\n\n\nI I 'm planning to have ah I mean to secure a new I D\n\n\nI don't know, if I can secure one this time\n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe you could\n\n\nWell as for me I think I have to because it 's in such a bad condition  \n\n\nMaybe we could even go together and secure both our I Ds\n\n<$B> \n\nOh you haven't changed your I D yet\n\n<$A> \n\nNot yet  \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd now I 'm sure there 's a long line out there, for all, the people who want to secure a new I D just because they too are ashamed of their faces  during their freshman year\n\n\nI know  \n\n<$B> \n\nSo have you heard of that incident I mean of the\n\n<$A> \n\nBrawls\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know when when Atty Cruz mentioned about the numerous brawls that occurred in La Salle I was a bit surprised because I 've never witnessed one\n\n\nI 've never even heard of one\n\n\nHow about you\n\n<$B> \n\nMe too uhm I just only learned through Atty Cruz\n\n\nI don't know when that happened\n\n\nI haven't seen one\n\n\nI haven't heard one too\n\n\nJust from her\n\n\nWhen was that\n\n\nWhat   do you  think\n\n<$A> \n\n I think   \n\n\nI mean I 'm not really sure\n\n\nI 've I 've no idea\n\n\nBut then rumors has it that it 's between fraternities\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah so I assume that if there will be  fraternities which is very much I mean, they violate they are violating our\n\n<$A> \n\nSchool policy\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah school policy\n\n\nThey should be expelled from the school\n\n\nIs it  \n\n<$A> \n\nBut that 's part of the problem\n\n\nThey were not able to identify who the participants were\n\n\nSo that 's why they insisted on the I D policy\n\n<$B> \n\nDidn't you know that the students of Velasco I mean the Engineering students were already obliged to wear their I D inside their building\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy only in Velasco\n\n<$B> \n\nI think in Gokongwei too\n\n\nI mean maybe that 's one of their reasons for safety and security\n\n\nSo maybe our department I mean C B E  is trying to follow them I think\n\n\nI just don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n\nDoes the brawl occur in Velasco and Gokongwei most of the time\n\n<$B> \n\nNot necessarily but I heard that one incident  happened when uhm there 's a brawl which happened in front of a D O  imagine that\n\n<$A> \n\nOh they 're really brave  ha  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what did the D O  do\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nI haven't heard much of that news\n\n\nMaybe I can just ask one of my friends to tell me more about that\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen you find out you tell me all the details\n\n<$B> \n\nOh sure\n\n\nSpeaking of problems uhm I think I may need your advice\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n<$B> \n\nWell <unclear> word </unclear> well I 've been having problems with my best friend lately\n\n\nRemember him\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nWell, I don't know how I can call it but, I think uhm we 've got uhm we don't no longer communicate nowadays\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat exactly happened\n\n<$B> \n\nWell for one thing, I decided to cut\n\n<$A> \n\nThe   communication  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nWhy why did you do that\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I don't know\n\n\nI 've been thinking it for ages now and I think it was just  parang  now is just the time that I woke up or, I 'm really in my senses that\n\n\nI don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nDid he do something wrong to you\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah he\n\n\nWould I just cut our communication if he didn't did something wrong\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat exactly did he do\n\n<$B> \n\nWell for me, what he did was unforgivable, as in unforgivable\n\n\nI 've heard that he was a bit intimidated by me\n\n\nI don't know why\n\n<$A> \n\nIntimidated by you\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy would he feel that\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nI haven't realized that 'till then 'till now\n\n\nI mean uhm haven't I told you before that he was about last  just this vacation   summer  he was about to give me something but then he was thinking twice of giving it to me because he thinks that I won't I won't be using it\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nBut you 've been best friends for such a long time   and  so why is he feel intimidated by you now\n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n<$A> \n\nI mean you know it just doesn't make sense\n\n<$B> \n\nMe too me and my friends are wondering why\n\n\nUhm I don't know about him\n\n\nI asked him about that but he seems quiet that that topic will be talked about\n\n<$A> \n\nHe just doesn't want to talk about it\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nUh but maybe he has developed some feelings for you\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know hope not 'cause I don't know how to deal with it\n\n<$A> \n\nBut do you like him\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but just for a friend\n\n<$A> \n\nJust for a friend and now you miss him\n\n<$B> \n\nObviously\n\n\nI 'm, the incident last summer was just I mean was just nothing\n\n\nI I decided not to think more about it anymore but then uhm it happened again just during this sem break\n\n\nWell it was one Sunday night when he asked me to go to his place\n\n\nIt 's because it was his younger brother 's birthday\n\n\nI was kind of hesitant then because I was too shy to go to their place especially meeting his parents\n\n\nHaven't you realized that\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I don't know but the real, it wasn't any problem with his invitation\n\n\nIn fact I was too eager to go to his place uhm but then during our conversation I mean on the phone when we 're talking on the phone uhm he was kind of I think he decided not to\n\n<$A> \n\nTo invite you\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah to invite me anymore\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you say something to him that made him change his mind\n\n<$B> \n\nNone at all\n\n\nIn fact uhm I was kind of he he knew that I was so excited but then he reasoned out that he was just too shy of himself to let to let\n\n<$A> \n\nYou\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah to let me show their place\n\n\nIt 's because he feels that I 'm I mean too rich I mean for him\n\n\nJust like that matters like that\n\n<$A> \n\nBut the fact that you and he are best friends for such along time I mean doesn't that mean anything to him, \n\n\nDoesn't he realize that you 've when you 've decided to be friends with him that you have already accepted him\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's what I don't ah that 's what I didn't expect from him\n\n\nThat 's what I don't understand from him\n\n\nImagine we 've been friends for five years now and it was only this time that he brought this the topic up\n\n\nSo I was thinking that he was he already had <unclear> 2 words </unclear> in his mind before\n\n<$A> \n\nBut why is it only now that he act that way\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nWhen I told my friends about that they too are wondering, why the sudden change in his attitude\n\n<$A> \n\nAre you sure you didn't say or do anything, \n\n<$B> \n\nNo I didn't do anything wrong\n\n\nI never remember doing anything that might hurt him \n\n So with that conclusion I think uhm I mean he did that to me once during summer vacation so I think if he won't be able to accept me for who I am then it 's just useless to continue our friendship\n\n<$A> \n\nBut it 's such a waste to, you know to let your friendship go like that\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah and I agree with you with that uhm but then I can't do anything\n\n\nI don't see any point in continuing our  or keeping our friendship if he behaves like that", "subdomain":

\n\nDecember December   as early as December  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh December   \n\n\nDo do they  ano  do they encourage part-timers\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's actually what they do\n\n<$A> \n\nUh   so you don't have any benefits  \n\n<$B> \n\n Actually all the other teachers there   \n\n\nNo we don't have any and we are we are being paid by the hour also\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo oo  \n\n<$B> \n\nSo the number of subjects that you handle or course we call it course the number of course the the the compensation depends upon the\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo  \n\n<$B> \n\nThe number of of loads that you  handle\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you receive  ano  uhm trainings\n\n<$B> \n\nYes yes that 's it   one of the benefits  \n\n<$A> \n\n Oh that 's what I want   \n\n<$B> \n\nFor one uhm before you could even handle before you start handling classes\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo  \n\n<$B> \n\nYou have to go through a training because you have   to imbibe  \n\n<$A> \n\n For free   \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah   you have  to imbibe their    methodology  \n\n<$A> \n\n Wow   \n\n\n  Oo oo    \n\n<$B> \n\nThey will it 's like brainstorming you\n\n<$A> \n\n Talaga  \n\n<$B> \n\n Oo  to use their method\n\n<$A> \n\nHave you acquired something from them I mean\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nThat you could use for your own personal business like   tutorial  \n\n<$B> \n\n Actually   \n\n\n  Actually the methodology  \n\n<$A> \n\n You are doing it now   \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\n Talaga  \n\n<$B> \n\nThe methodology   is really  manageable   \n\n<$A> \n\n How I wish   I could be connected at   Speechpower  \n\n<$B> \n\n That 's that 's   what I 've been telling you about when it comes to exposure experience   because once you  once you mentioned the name of Speechpower it 's it has a  it 's prestigious   in a way  \n\n<$A> \n\n  Oo oo oo    \n\n\n  Oo oo oo    \n\n<$B> \n\n'Cause once you say Speechpower I came from Speechpower   actually  \n\n<$A> \n\n Compare to other    uh uh\n\n<$B> \n\nSpeech\n\n<$A> \n\nSpeech     I don't know speech   schools  offering speech  oo  courses\n\n<$B> \n\n Schools   \n\n\n Centers   \n\n\nThey I think they are the one of the most famous   I think  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uh   the most uh reliable  \n\n<$B> \n\nWell yes because that 's because we have to   go  through a certain training\n\n<$A> \n\n School   \n\n\n Talaga  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nHow much do they pay   their training instructress  \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh on that part   it 's not too much\n\n<$A> \n\nAt least\n\n<$B> \n\nI   was only getting  \n\n<$A> \n\n Per load   per unit\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's a per per hour basis\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI was getting eighty then\n\n<$A> \n\nEighty per hour, \n\n In other schools\n\n<$B> \n\nIn other in other colleges\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThey also pay well as low\n\n<$A> \n\nAs as lower than eighty\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I think as low as\n\n<$A> \n\nOr at least near to eighty\n\n<$B> \n\nNear eighty\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I don't know of any Speechpower schools  na  near  sa  Rizal Tanay Rizal\n\n<$B> \n\nI think the   nearest that you could go  to\n\n<$A> \n\n There 's one in Cainta   \n\n<$B> \n\nNo no   no  \n\n<$A> \n\n None   \n\n<$B> \n\nThe nearest the nearest Speechpower\n\n\nWhat  \n\n\nYeah  \n\n\nNothing we 're just doing this  \n\n<$A> \n\nSpeechpower school\n\n<$B> \n\nThe nearest Speechpower\n\n<$A> \n\nIn our to our province Tanay Rizal\n\n<$B> \n\n Nyek  the nearest is in Cubao\n\n<$A> \n\n Ay  that 's too far\n\n<$B> \n\nThat far but my goodness that 's one ride one one ride  di ba  one ride from Tanay is it\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nThere is\n\n<$A> \n\nYou go to Antipolo first and then you ride another jeepney\n\n<$B> \n\n Niye  it 's too   far  \n\n<$A> \n\n Right   \n\n\nI thought there 's one in Antipolo\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know maybe it 's a different school\n\n\nIt 's uh I probably I don't know if they have   they have  \n\n<$A> \n\n  Oo nga e    \n\n<$B> \n\nOr maybe\n\n<$A> \n\n Kasi    that 's what I 'm  after uh\n\n<$B> \n\n One of the branches   \n\n\nBecause they go from place to place\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo   nga e   \n\n<$B> \n\n I mean   uh from last year they have given up or I think it was two years ago they 've they have given up their their branch in Caloocan\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then in lieu for in lieu of the  ano ba 'to  branch  na 'to  \n\n\nWhere was that\n\n\nIn, Bi&ntilde;an\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThere 's another one in Bi&ntilde;an\n\n\nActually what they do is that they go to a certain   school  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then they try to they they rent the place\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd well they  I think they have an ex-deal wherein they 're also going to train the teachers in that certain school\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo in the south the there 's the Golden Valley School of Bi&ntilde;an\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then next to that the nearest spot is that of Taft\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThe one in Taft\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then, the one in in Espa&ntilde;a\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThe more regular ones the ones that do not close are the ones in Espa&ntilde;a and then Cubao\n\n\nThose two uhm they don't they  they they 're they are it 's always there\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause that 's where their the two links how do you say that links I suppose are and then\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat year what year were you connected\n\n<$B> \n\nI started at   uhm summer of  \n\n<$A> \n\n Did you   work on\n\n<$B> \n\nNineteen ninety-three  oo  summer of ninety-three\n\n<$A> \n\nSo that 's seven years ago\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but uh this year I didn't teach\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat about uh if you enroll as a student do you pay   uhm  that much\n\n<$B> \n\n Now   \n\n\nAt four thousand\n\n<$A> \n\nFour thousand of what\n\n<$B> \n\nAt it 's at four thousand\n\n<$A> \n\nFor how many units\n\n<$B> \n\nNo that 's that is twenty-four hours spread out, \n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\n Parang  two, two hours per meeting per session\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nNormally it 's two to three\n\n<$A> \n\nHours\n\n<$B> \n\nTwo to three days a week\n\n<$A> \n\nUh two to three days\n\n<$B> \n\nA week\n\n<$A> \n\nA week, \n\n<$B> \n\nSo you finish the twenty-four hour session  ,  in four weeks or if it 's a two hour session in two uh two days for two days in a   week  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nThat is that 's that would, stretch out for six weeks   yeah   oo  six weeks  ay  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nOh so it 's it 's different from any regular school I mean  the way they handle the subjects\n\n<$B> \n\nUh yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nThe way they offer the   subjects  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah different   quite different quite different   and they have  \n\n<$A> \n\n And this is   not the same with the other regular  regular schools uh which offer\n\n<$B> \n\nVery different   very  different   except that it 's  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh   \n\n\n Twenty-one units   and then you attend regularly daily or M W F T T H no\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n\nIt is you have a regular schedule though\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYou go on   regular schedule  \n\n<$A> \n\n But shorter   \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah because it 's just   <unclear> word </unclear> in our profession  \n\n<$A> \n\n  Kaya lang    I would be wasting four thousand\n\n<$B> \n\nOh why don't why don't you just apply\n\n<$A> \n\nJust apply   and  be a teacher\n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then acquire\n\n<$B> \n\nUndergo training   for free  \n\n<$A> \n\n The methodology   \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then you also take you 're also you have the privilege to take one course\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\nFor free\n\n<$B> \n\nFor free\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nDuring the time that you 're teaching\n\n\nSo you just find time to attend and they would even encourage you to attend\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSome of their courses \n\n consultants \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYou just ask the consultant if you could  uh sit in for one or two sessions  ,  just to just to observe\n\n\nActually they they encourage newcomers to observe the  ,  the old comer the old comers the old ones the old timers \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n \n\n\nWhere is the  ano  where is the the main office or the main\n\n<$B> \n\nThe main is that\n\n<$A> \n\nMain office\n\n<$B> \n\nCubao\n\n<$A> \n\nUh Cubao the one that you   mentioned a while  ago\n\n<$B> \n\n The main office   yeah\n\n\nThat 's the main because that 's their building\n\n<$A> \n\nProbably they know if there are other branches aside I mean\n\n<$B> \n\n Oo  really\n\n<$A> \n\nIn what areas the other branches are located\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah yes you may do so\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I could probably ask   if there 's one in Antipolo  I 'll be\n\n<$B> \n\n And they would even tell you   \n\n\nThey would even tell you to go to this place it 's nearer your place\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo  \n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's basically the same\n\n\nIt 's our branch\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThey 'll tell you that\n\n<$A> \n\nBut uhm  ano   commonly how many units do they give a a consultant as you call yourself\n\n<$B> \n\nIt depends\n\n<$A> \n\nIt depends\n\n<$B> \n\n Oo  \n\n<$A> \n\nAs long as you can handle the number of units\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause I used to handle before I was given a an eight to five\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nEight to five job like it 's from eight to ten then ten to twelve then we have a break from twelve to one and then one to three three to five\n\n\nThat 's how it is\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then when I was already in I think on my third year they gave me an eight to eight job\n\n<$A> \n\nHuh   my God  \n\n<$B> \n\n Because that   depends upon the vai availability of the consultant\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd yet you don't have any benefits even if you have been teaching for that long already\n\n<$B> \n\nNone because teachers just come and go consultants come and go, \n\n<$A> \n\nSo you 're not  I mean you 're you 're your status is not on a permanent basis   but just a part-timer  \n\n<$B> \n\n It should be on a permanent   basis\n\n<$A> \n\nAhhh\n\n<$B> \n\nThat is if you are one of the one of the what do you call them operations manager\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat do   you mean  \n\n<$B> \n\n If you 're   one of the operations managers then\n\n<$A> \n\nYou share a\n\n<$B> \n\nYou are\n\n<$A> \n\nA capital  \n\n<$B> \n\nNo not really\n\n\nYou 're the you are the what do you what do they call them\n\n\nLittle J Ms J M the owner the owner   the founder  \n\n<$A> \n\n Junior manager   \n\n<$B> \n\nNo no no the founder\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nThe founder owner of Speechpower, the J M  \n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know\n\n<$B> \n\nThere he 's Joe Mordano the Little J M because they do the they call the shots\n\n<$A> \n\nHow I wish there were there 's one in Antipolo   so I could probably  work as a part-timer\n\n<$B> \n\n If there 's if there is   another one\n\n\nIf there would be a new one\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know what is rewarding is the experience\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo    that 's what I 'm asking for  \n\n<$B> \n\n You 'd be exposed to   the experience to the modules and besides this is about what is good at Speechpower that 's why I stayed that long\n\n<$A> \n\nHow many years did you work there\n\n<$B> \n\nWell six six\n\n<$A> \n\nUh six years\n\n<$B> \n\nSix not uh continuously  ha  \n\n<$A> \n\n Oo  \n\n<$B> \n\nBecause during the regular school year I go to my to   regular school, during summer  \n\n<$A> \n\n  Ay  no wait wait wait may I   interrupt you\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nNot Speechpower in Antipolo\n\n\nIt 's it 's it 's S T I  pala  \n\n\nMy goodness, \n\n\n Oo kasi  I know of one my my former or rather  oo  my

our dismissal time is at two thirty or three thirty\n\n\nWell at Saint Peter, we we go home at around five thirty so it 's better\n\n\nCollege is better\n\n<$B> \n\nOurs is four so it 's not much of a difference  \n\n\nBut, college is okay since, we learn to be more independent of ourselves\n\n\nIn high school you 're still like in the four walls of the school\n\n\n  You don't go  \n\n<$A> \n\n Everyone spoon-   feeds you\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah you don't go out much like in college, you go out you see the world you see how it looks like  \n\n<$A> \n\nMake projects tons of projects and paper work\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah that 's the only problem  \n\n\nWe have lots of projects\n\n<$A> \n\n  Lots of  \n\n<$B> \n\n In high   school we like, we sit around watch T V  \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd do

childlike on our first year\n\n\nWe had, water guns  \n\n\nYeah, water guns\n\n\nThey are, they were shooting water guns, \n\n\nTeachers confiscate water guns  \n\n\nSomebody brought a big water gun\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nI thought what 's in the bag and it 's a big water gun, and then, on our first year there 's still  sipa  \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah still they still play it then second year there 's the mousse  \n\n\nYeah you have to bring shampoo and a towel to wash it off  your hair\n\n\nYeah and the end of the year uhm end of the year, everybody was, putting mousse everywhere  yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nIn your hair\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah, friends like that\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nPutting it on each other 's friends\n\n\nIt was so funny but it was fun\n\n<$A> \n\nHuh, our batch we were in fourth year then and also like uh  Day\n\n\nWe had this celebration for teachers but we ended up in a food fight and everyone the whole fourth floor was really splattered with food because us the fourth year was like wow throwing foods soda ice cream cake at each other\n\n\nThen afterward the Religion Department got angry and made  us clean up the whole mess  \n\n\nAnd then they 've, they, suspended us for a day\n\n\nSo we didn't have class for a day which was actually kind of fun  \n\n\nSo <O> chuckle <O> so  we are bad  \n\n\nWe never, regretted it\n\n\nActually, I felt kind of sad 'cause the food, went to waste but well it was a fun experience once in a lifetime kind of thing\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah you don't get to food fight I don't know\n\n\nI haven't experienced food fight in my life yet\n\n<$A> \n\nIt was really yucky you know\n\n\nYour hair with y'know pieces of   food  ice cream spaghetti cake icing oh no\n\n<$B> \n\n Spaghetti   \n\n\nIcing is better\n\n\nI

don't have any opponent  and then\n\n<$A> \n\n   You just watch  \n\n<$B> \n\n Automatically   I win\n\n\nBut I don't get to, have a trophy so uhm 'cause my friends who played against they have uh

lot of work three times a week three hours\n\n\nBut you know the thing is it 's easier for him than for me 'cause\nhe does the written phase  ,  so when they write he can sit\ndown  ,  and rest\n\n\nI you ask   Telly  how she felt when she was listening\nto me  she said\n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\n Rest  oo oo    \n\n\n  Oo nga    \n\n\nShe was more tired than you\n\n<$B> \n\nShe was definitely more tired than I because I was you know my\nadrenaline was pumping  ,  because here is this group of\nseven nice nuns and I wanted to find out how much I can do really   \n,  but it 's too much\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n Uh hum   \n\n\nI thought Annabelle Lee would have handled the class, she has\n\n  no patience  \n\n<$B> \n\n Telly didn't   I don't know Telly said if she\nhandles it then I will have to worry about it  ,  \n\n\nAnd so she wanted me to handle it first  ,  \n\n\nI said Telly you know I tried  ha  I 've been a\nvery good girl  ,  \n\n\nI tried and she she almost faints  siguro  almost\nfainted  \n\n\n Ay  Telly let her tell you\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh huh okay   \n\n\n  Oo    \n\n\n  Oo oo    \n\n<$B> \n\n Ay  gosh but the thing is when when the guy\nshowed me the written work it was so good yes  ,  it 's\nalmost poetic   the language is almost poetic  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh really  ha    \n\n\n So it 's really just practice   they need practice\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's the mouth and the ears\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo  \n\n\nSo   that means they are  reading a lot I guess in China\n\n<$B> \n\n It 's the oral phase   \n\n\nI think so yes yes yes and they are reading but when you talk to\nthem they can hardly understand you\n\n\nYou have to speak very slowly and even then they cannot understand\nyou\n\n\nSo you have to write go to the board I have to write every word\nalmost every word I would say\n\n<$A> \n\nOh my gosh\n\n\n Oo  \n\n<$B> \n\nI said okay let 's talk about opposites\n\n\n\" Opposite opposite \" \n\n\nThen they would check their dictionaries\n\n\nEach one had a

equipped\nso that in case they have to ask questions\n\n\nI haven't said good-bye to them\n\n\nI said  o  Telly I haven't said good-bye to them\nand because I want to tell the reason why I cannot continue with them is I\ndon't know  I have to think of a nice reason\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n It 's too much work\n\n<$B> \n\nUh I don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nSo Telly reports every day\n\n<$B> \n\nNo

Benjie  what is this rumor I 'm hearing about\nyou\n\n\nAnd then he says  Hindi ko nga ho alam ba't ginaganito nila\nako e  \n\n\nI don't know why they 're doing this to   me  \n\n\nYou mean there 's no truth to that rumor\n\n\n Wala sabi niya  \n\n\nSo I 'll go there on November and follow up my papers personally\nand find out why they 're giving me a problem with my papers\n\n\nSo\n\n<$A> \n\n Oh my God   \n\n\nOh my God when did you call him\n\n<$C> \n\nAbout a month   <unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n<$A> \n\n Before November   \n\n\nWhen did you start hearing the rumor\n\n<$C> \n\nProbably   August  \n\n<$B> \n\n Did somebody   check bother to check\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah Lita wrote  Stanford  University\n\n\nBut you know the the funny thing is Wyona  yon hindi ba\n\n before the Dean uh works on the papers before the appointment is\ndone and <unclear> 2 words </unclear> committee the V P A clears the papers\n\n di ba tapos noon  go on and hire\n\n\nSo we assumed that  ,  Wyona did all the background\nchecking otherwise she would not have told us okay go on and hire  Benjie\nRebullida  \n\n\nSo we hired him and I we we gave him Associate four which is only\nfor P H D holders\n\n\n Tapos ni-  recommend  ko pa na  \nprofessorial chair holder\n\n<$B> \n\n It was cleared   \n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n\nHe was so promising so bright  ,  very bright\n\n<$C> \n\n  Oo oo    \n\n\nAnd then so I was told that somebody from abroad came and\nmentioned that to the International Studies people\n\n\nBut I didn't believe because I called  Benjie  and he\ndenied not having a P H D\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd did he show anything\n\n<$C> \n\nNo so we went over his papers and uh they you know the people\nfrom  Stanford  didn't say he does not have a P H D\n\n<$B> \n\n Ha  \n\n<$C> \n\n Oo  that 's why Wyona gave him they cleared\nhis name but they didn't mention that he has no P H D so we I I Wyona must\nhave assumed that  ,  okay and then Lita wrote\n\n<$B> \n\n Strange  'no    \n\n<$A> \n\nDidn't  Stanford  say he 's a graduate or   \nsomething like that  \n\n<$C> \n\n No no no  basta    they cleared\nname  niya  but not the degree\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat do you mean by \" cleared \" \n\n<$C> \n\nThat he has no problems\n\n<$B> \n\nBut what you are interested in is   his degree  \n\n<$A> \n\n It was a   character reference it was a character\nreference\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah a character reference\n\n\nI don't know what Wyona asked but that was the paper   that\nI saw  \n\n\nAnd so Lita finally wrote and was told he has no P H D\n\n<$B> \n\n Oh my   \n\n\nThat he does not   have categorically  he does not have\na P H D\n\n<$C> \n\n  Wala    \n\n\nA P H D  \n\n<$B> \n\nWas he working on his dissertation\n\n\nDid he have an academic\n\n<$C> \n\nI think he had a problem with his adviser\n\n\nThat was what all of these\n\n<$B> \n\nUsually it comes out\n\n<$A> \n\nIt was speculation already\n\n<$C> \n\n Oo  all of these were rumors rumors\n\n<$B> \n\n Oo  \n\n<$A> \n\n O  where is he now\n\n<$C> \n\nHe 's still with La Salle  ,  paying back\neverything\n\n\nSo  hindi ba  we paid him uh the rate of the\nAssociate four\n\n<$B> \n\n  Ha    \n\n\nWhat 's he paying back\n\n<$C> \n\n E di sobra yung ano  he was his rank was\nchanged now so he was made  ,  Associate  siya 'no\n\n now he was made Assistant Prof\n\n\nAnd so he 's paying now the difference between Assistant and  \n\n,  the Chair also four thousand five hundred\n\n<$A> \n\n Associate   \n\n\n And the Chair   \n\n<$B> \n\nOh my gosh\n\n\nIt 's a wonder that he still sticks around\n\n<$C> \n\n Sabi ko  I hope I don't meet him   ba't naman pati yung  I called him  'no\n\n and said this is very confidential\n\n\nWill you please tell me\n\n\nHe said he has a P H D\n\n<$A> \n\nOh my gosh\n\n<$C> \n\nYou know I it was  Manolo  who recommended him\n\n\n Hindi ba   Manolo  went abroad so then he\nbrings this  Benjie Rebullida  and he says  o  he has a\nP H D tatata tatata make sure we don't lose him tatata tatata so  ako\nnaman  I worked fast and we hired him\n\n<$B> \n\nAt Lyceum I always told do not take any word of any man or\nwoman who claims to have a P H D if there is no paper attached\n\n\n Kasi  I 've learned that early enough in my career\nas a Dean\n\n<$C> \n\nI think you know Wyona I have a feeling that Wyona considers\n\n Manolo  's word  parang  the guarantee\n\n<$B> \n\nUh no no no\n\n<$C> \n\n Ayan ayan  \n\n<$B> \n\nThis is not the first time that it happened in De La Salle\n\n di ba  \n\n<$C> \n\nIn Liberal Arts\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nSeveral cases I guess but I cannot cannot remember a case\n\n<$B> \n\nI usually would tell uh uh Paulino I already told you be very\nvery careful\n\n\nAs it has strung me once and I will never forget that  , \n\n \n\n\nAnd you 'll recall that was only one person that said she\ngraduated as an honor student at U P\n\n<$C> \n\n  Oo oo    \n\n\n Oo oo  \n\n\nBut you know  Benjie  I think didn't apply\n\n\nIt was  Manolo  who encouraged him to join La Salle\n\n<$B> \n\nAll you need is\n\n\n Hindi ba  when I applied at De La Salle  \nkumpleto ang  papers  pati  transcript  ko\n\n plus the diploma\n\n<$C> \n\n Hay naku  I really don't like to see  \nBenjie  anymore because I called him I called him\n\n<$B> \n\n Hindi ba si   Santos  also\n\n\nRemember that  Santos  guy the one who sang with the\nChorale French computer  ba  computer\n\n<$A> \n\nAhh  Carlo  \n\n<$B> \n\n Carlo   oo nga  \n\n<$C> \n\nHe didn't have a P H D also\n\n<$A> \n\nHe did not defend his dissertation or something\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd yet when people called him \" Doctor \" he\ndidn't correct them\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd he was Dean\n\n<$C> \n\nSo the latest is Brother Andrew uh is giving him I don't know\nhow true this is  'no  up to the end of uh this school year to\nfinish  ,  to finish his P H D\n\n<$B> \n\n To pay   \n\n\n Aba , where\n\n<$C> \n\nI don't   Stanford  \n\n<$B> \n\nGo back  ganoon

\n\n<$A> \n\nFunny  naman   Stanford  \n\n<$C> \n\nI didn't see the letter of  Stanford  to Lita but that\nwas what Lita told me  wala siyang  P H D\n\n\nThat 's why he 's paying back", "subdomain":

lonely\n\n<$A> \n\nBeing lonely\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I just don't want to be alone, \n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's hard being alone definitely\n\n\nLike they said  no man is an island  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah that 's right\n\n<$A> \n\nAs for me I I fear snakes\n\n\nI hate them\n\n\nI despise them for besides that I would I fear what I fear the most is not being able to be a good mother or wife, \n\n\nIt 's not like there are books you could follow or you know   uhm  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   unlike in cookbooks you just\n\n<$A> \n\nFollow the   instructions  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   follow the instructions get the ingredients and\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nVoila it 's there, \n\n\nLife is really like that\n\n<$A> \n\nYou just have to do what, you have to do\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n\nDo what you think is right\n\n\nDo things that you think will make you happy\n\n<$A> \n\nMake do with what you have\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nHey I have a question for you\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat\n\n<$A> \n\nUh what do you think about teenagers nowadays\n\n\nWere you that wild back then\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nI know I wasn't\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah no, I mean, teenagers nowadays are very extreme, like, \n\n<$A> \n\nAt thirteen at twelve years old they get to have a boyfriend smoke drink do drugs have sex\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah although I did those things\n\n<$A> \n\nBut not that early\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah not that early\n\n\nAt the age around seventeen after high school\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut definitely not grade school  \n\n<$A> \n\nWhat about getting married\n\n\nSo when do you plan to get married\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uhm around twenty-four to twenty-six   I mean  \n\n<$A> \n\n Why   so late\n\n<$B> \n\nWell nowadays it 's really hard to make a living and\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah   I know  \n\n<$B> \n\n I think   you have to be financially stable emotionally stable at the same   time  to get into such things   so  \n\n<$A> \n\n Definitely   \n\n\n Yes   \n\n\nYou have to be mature   in order to  be married to somebody not mature\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nYeah 'cause that 's hard\n\n\nIt takes a lot of responsibility to get into one\n\n\nIt 's a very serious thing\n\n\nIt 's a lifetime thing so\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's a lifetime   commitment actually  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah so you really   have to think about it uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat else is holding you back, \n\n\nFinding uh the right kind of guy  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah same thing same thing as before\n\n\nIt 's finding the right person I mean it 's easy to look no it 's easy to look for the the person but looking for the right person the person   who  \n\n<$A> \n\n You   believe in such things the right   person the right man the right one  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah as I mentioned earlier   I still believe in those things\n\n\nI still believe that there is such thing as as I I mentioned before the magic thing\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh you know you just feel it\n\n\nOnce it 's there it 's there\n\n\nI don't know\n\n\nI 'm not sure, \n\n<$A> \n\nHow about soul mates\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I do believe in soul mates but for me soul mates comes in different   aspects  \n\n<$A> \n\n Forms   \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah yeah different kinds of relationships also like\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm friendships \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n\nYour soul mate can be your Mom it can be your brother or even a friend\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's just someone who you feel close to\n\n<$A> \n\nSomebody you can connect with\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah \n\n So, how 's your married life\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's okay it 's not that it 's not what I expected it would be but it 's definitely great having someone beside you and everything\n\n\nAnd having a kid to light up your life  ang  corny  \n\n\nAnyway but it 's true you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah it 's true\n\n<$A> \n\nEven if you 're tired and everything when you get home you see that smile in your kid, well, it erases all the tiredness away  and\n\n<$B> \n\nI can see that\n\n\nI can see how how hard it is to take care of a kid and a husband at the same time\n\n\nBut at the same time I <.> also see the brighter side of it   you know  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\nIt makes you glow it gives you more uhm sort of inspiration to do things\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah definitely   that 's one  of the things that you should remember when getting married\n\n<$B> \n\n That 's why   \n\n<$A> \n\nDon't just focus on the bad side but you know try try to focus on the good side not dwell on the bad\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nIn order for you to have a good marriage\n\n<$B> \n\nUh that I 'd know in time\n\n\nI think I have to

'm ready to answer\n\n<$A> \n\nLet 's talk about our trips abroad\n\n<$B> \n\nTrips abroad\n\n\nActually I 'm going to Philadelphia\n\n<$A> \n\nOh don't brag about it\n\n<$B> \n\nHopefully   on  sometime this week if ever I get my visa then\n\n<$A> \n\n    \n\n<$B> \n\n'Cause my friend is going there on Sunday and I 'm not and he 's really he really wants me to go with him because he doesn't know his way around Disneyland\n\n\nHow   about you  \n\n<$A> \n\n So it 's   it 's his first time\n\n<$B> \n\nYup it 's Dan 's first time in the States and Dan and I planned ourselves our trip to the

everything  \n\n<$A> \n\n But the   but\n\n<$B> \n\nDuring the course of the training\n\n<$A> \n\n during the course of the training\n\n<$B> \n\nBut after that which is around April fourteen we will be going on our own using our own money which frankly is not that much\n\n<$A> \n\nThat hurts your Mom\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy would that hurt my Mom\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause she 's gonna spend for you\n\n<$B> \n\nMy Mom 's not gonna spend for me that 's all my savings in my bank\n\n<$A> \n\nHow about our, \n\n\nForget it\n\n<$B> \n\nOur what\n\n<$A> \n\nForget it\n\n<$B> \n\nForget what\n\n\n Ha  \n\n<$A>

some project, in the U K\n\n<$A> \n\nBut aren't you thankful that you are in the per diem basis not allowance\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah that 's cool actually because being on an allowance is really a

spent\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what 's the minimum, uh, allowance you get\n\n<$B> \n\nSpeak louder\n\n<$A> \n\nSorry\n\n\nWhat 's the minimum allowance from the  the office\n\n<$B> \n\nSo the for the standard allowance for people going to the States it is forty-four dollars a day\n\n\nThat would include everything from breakfast lunch dinner   laundry  everything\n\n<$A> \n\n So   \n\n\nOkay so meaning that per diem basis means that if you are if you 're if you are going to spend only ten bucks a day   so  \n\n<$B> \n\n I get   to keep all thirty-four   dollars  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nWow\n\n<$B> \n\nYup wow\n\n\nBut that 's small compared to the per diem we get when we are assigned to Hong Kong\n\n<$A> \n\n  You were  \n\n<$B> \n\n It 's close   to sixty-six dollars\n\n\nThat was when Dan was assigned to Hong Kong   that was the standard per diem  \n\n<$A> \n\n You were there   \n\n<$B> \n\nI wasn't there\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\n'Cause I wasn't there

{"text": "<$A> \n\nExplain it\n\n<$B> \n\nFor me peer pressure is uhm getting influenced by your friends\n\n\nIt 's like when your friends try to tell you to do this or that and you think that it really isn't right\n\n\nIt 's like you, since they are your friends you go along with the flow and you just, you just do what they say\n\n\nSo uhm they they won't be able to tell you that you are chicken or something\n\n<$A> \n\nI think I think I also feel the same way about it\n\n\nUhm I think that peer pressure is very, very\n\n<$B> \n\nCommon\n\n<$A> \n\nCommon now\n\n\nI mean,  each every every any person goes through this you know and it 's just like yeah your friends telling you to do something that you 're not sure of doing but you end up doing it and then later you regret doing it\n\n\nIt 's usually that 's usually the case   for   any person any student\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nSo, uh do you do you have any experiences that can be related to to this topic 'cause I do but   you first  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nI asked you first\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay I have I have some actually many but I 'll just state one like there was this time when it was our lunch break\n\n\nI wait at Wendy 's and  one of my friends just spurted out that what if we cut class and we watch this movie I  I heard it 's nice \n\n\nThen  all of sudden uhm each one of us gave in and except except one of my friend\n\n\nI think uhm the pressure really was on my friend because uhm she really didn't want to cut class because she besides that she liked that class she never cut class in her life\n\n\nSo uhm there the pressure was there and at the end uhm she was able to control herself\n\n\nSo she really didn't give in but we did\n\n\nAnd after watching that movie, we really felt so guilty\n\n\nAll of us felt so guilty because after that when we went to our next class they told us that we had a test in that class\n\n\nThat 's why we really regretted what we did\n\n\nHow about you\n\n<$A> \n\nI have this friend who always cuts I mean me I don't really like the feeling of   cutting classes  \n\n<$B> \n\n Cutting class   \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah uhm one time uhm, we I  we we were gonna have this test this long test\n\n\nBut you know I wasn't able to study for it\n\n\nSo I was thinking if if I should just not go to class\n\n<$B> \n\nSince you did not   study  for it\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nYeah since I didn't study for it\n\n\nThen my my  all along my  my classmate was also thinking of the same thing\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I wasn't really, considering, that that  considering cutting class but then my friend forced me into it\n\n\nShe she she forced me to do it\n\n\n  So we   yeah  \n\n<$B> \n\n Did you   \n\n<$A> \n\nWe ended up cutting class\n\n\nThen the next   the next   the next meeting uhm I found out that that the test was really easy\n\n<$B> \n\n Meeting   \n\n\n  Oh shit  \n\n<$A> \n\n It was open notes   so I really regretted doing it\n\n\nBut then uhm our our teacher gave me another chance and you know he gave me the same test\n\n<$B> \n\n  The same kind  of test\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nSo it was really easy\n\n\n  It was okay  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah it 's good that   it 's good that your teacher   gave  you the same kind of test  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nI mean uh I wonder what why do you think these things happen to us\n\n\nI mean   why  \n\n<$B> \n\n How   friends pressure us too much\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's maybe because uhm, it really depends on us if if we are that uh weak not that really weak but if we really give in at once to our friends\n\n\n'Cause sometimes uhm even though we know that this thing is not right we still do it for the sake of our friends since uhm we stay together then and if we don't go with them they might say things about us\n\n\nBut that 's not the nice part of it\n\n\nWe really should have our own principles, \n\n\nHow about you\n\n<$A> \n\nI think, yeah it depends on the person and you know sometimes, I think if if if peer if there wasn't peer pressure life would be boring\n\n<$B> \n\nBoring   so boring  \n\n<$A> \n\n I yeah    \n\n\nI mean I I I believe that, it 's so easy to do the the wrong thing   rather  than doing the right thing   'cause  it 's more exciting\n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n Yeah    \n\n<$A> \n\nThere and uhm oh why why do you why do you think your your friends pressure you\n\n\nWhy why I mean\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy do they\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nMaybe  maybe\n\n<$A> \n\n  They just want to,   \n\n<$B> \n\n They just want to do it   yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nThey just want to be with you\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah uh   yeah  \n\n<$A> \n\n That 's it   \n\n<$B> \n\nThey wanna do something different\n\n<$A> \n\nOr if they wanna do something bad, they want someone to be with them\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah   because  \n\n<$A> \n\n So that   it  it 's so that the blame\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah the\n\n<$A> \n\nThe blame would be, on all of you\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd not only on that person\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I think that 's it\n\n<$A> \n\nHow do you feel after being pressured\n\n<$B> \n\nAfter, if I if I really liked what I did uhm  of course I enjoyed doing it\n\n\nBut after when I think about it I really feel guilty\n\n\nBut what can I do I did it already\n\n\nSo there 's nothing I can do\n\n<$A> \n\nMe it really depends on on what I did\n\n\nOf course I I feel bad but then I think of the the excitement I felt   when I  experienced that certain thing\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah    \n\n\n'Cause sometimes you do something that you know it really isn't right but you really enjoyed doing it\n\n<$A> \n\n  Yeah  \n\n<$B> \n\n Especially if   you 're with your friends\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah and I have this one but then I had this one experience\n\n\nI cut class   and then  \n\n<$B> \n\n For what   \n\n<$A> \n\nUhm to watch a movie  the same with you\n\n\nThen we had fun\n\n\nBut when I got home I really felt bad and I\n\n<$B>

other\n\n<$A> \n\n It will make the relationship more strong\n\n<$B> \n\nI I really don't think that that 's true 'cause if you love a person uhm you can wait for each other\n\n\nYou know if your love is really uhm pure and honest how sex is not sex is nothing\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah it is it is yeah I I believe in that also\n\n\nI mean some guys  ay  most of the guys they even look for sex first\n\n<$B>

why people do drugs\n\n\nMaybe, yeah I know it 's certainly because of peer pressure but why do they still do it if they know that uhm a lot a lot of people really die because of drugs\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nAnd their life gets so   ruined  \n\n<$B> \n\n Miserable   \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah   get  really  it 's terrible I mean people just end up you know, in the streets\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nUhm doing nothing\n\n\nInstead of them working they just do drugs like the rugby boys under the bridges\n\n<$A> \n\n  Yeah and  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   you know I really every time most of the time we pass by that bridge I don't know what bridge that is\n\n\nAnyway under the bridge I can see a lot of young boys   uhm  \n\n<$A> \n\nI  think   those doing doing that that\n\n<$B> \n\nThose stuff\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know I think those boys do drugs I mean, specifically rugby 'cause, they have so many problems and you know they don't have money to, to buy food and they 're really hungry\n\n\nSo they just you know they just do drugs to forget forget their hunger forget their   problems  \n\n<$B> \n\n Problems   \n\n<$A> \n\nBut still I mean   they can  \n\n<$B> \n\n They 're not excused   \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah it 's no excuse I mean they can they can look for a job\n\n\nThey 're   not  they 're not disabled\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nI mean imagine disabled people\n\n\nThey 're disabled they 're they they like one one person one disabled person lacks a hand but still, that person you know  would work if if he or she had a chance\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I you know uhm but maybe because those young young boys uhm do do those drugs because they don't have money\n\n\nBut still it 's no excuse, on why why why they should do it\n\n\nThey could look they could look for jobs even though they 're uneducated like uhm there are a lot of programs in the government that give jobs to those uhm not only poor boys all people, all poor people\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah but what about those rich\n\n<$B> \n\nKids\n\n<$A> \n\nKids   I mean  they they all they have all the money to buy drugs I mean but still they don't even uhm you know   they don't  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n Engage   in those stuff\n\n<$A> \n\nThey shouldn't, they shouldn't engage in those stuff\n\n I mean they have their future ahead of them", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

taken from California or they 're pizzas based on California recipes\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's not because of the size\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't  \n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe it 's larger\n\n<$B> \n\nIs there a California size, \n\n<$A> \n\nWhat about in California Pizza Kitchen\n\n\nYou ate there the other day right, \n\n\nHow were their pizzas\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I think it it it 's mostly about the California lifestyle or\n\n<$A> \n\nSo it 's the flavor of the pizza\n\n<$B> \n\nI think it 's the flavor of the pizza\n\n<$A> \n\n  What do they have  \n\n<$B> \n\n Or the character   of of a Californian which is I suppose ambiguous because it 's a mix of Western and Asian <unclear> 1 word </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nRowdy bunch  \n\n<$B> \n\nA rowdy bunch it 's a rowdy bunch of ingredients\n\n\nSo uh I think that 's that 's why they call it California pizza it 's uh it 's a hodgepodge of of of of of influences\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd where do pizzas really come from anyway\n\n<$B> \n\nI think they originated from   Italy  \n\n<$A> \n\n From Italy    \n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nBut\n\n<$B> \n\nPizza what 's what 's the what 's the root word of \" pizza \" \n\n\nIs pizza like a piazza\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I don't think so\n\n<$B> \n\nUh   okay  \n\n<$A> \n\n Pizza   \n\n\nWhat does \" pizza \" mean\n\n\nIs it a piece\n\n<$B> \n\nDoes \" pizza \" mean\n\n<$A> \n\n   it 's a piece  of a pie\n\n<$B> \n\n A round   \n\n\nIt 's a piece of a pie\n\n<$A> \n\nI I don't know\n\n\nI 'm just guessing\n\n<$B> \n\nUh okay well  maybe it 's because I think it 's it 's uh well it 's probably the the uh the way Italians would do the uh like to have their round bread I suppose\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I 've eaten Italian pizzas and they 're not round\n\n\n  They 're actually  square\n\n<$B> \n\n Oh really   \n\n\nOkay   so  I guess\n\n<$A> \n\n Or     sort of rectangular  \n\n<$B> \n\n But the popular   \n\n\nWell does it also depend on the the location or the the place where it originated\n\n\nI mean there are\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'm not too sure because of the many regions in Italy\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah there are many uh there should be many types of pizzas according to the different regions\n\n<$A> \n\nI know there are different types of pizzas in terms of what you put inside the pizza or what you put on   a pizza  on top of a pizza\n\n<$B> \n\n On top   \n\n<$A> \n\nBut in terms of shape\n\n<$B> \n\nI think \" pizza \" means simply means the type of bread\n\n\nIt 's like a pita flour-based   bread  \n\n<$A> \n\n Actually   it 's flat  nga e  \n\n\n  It 's  your thin crust not the thick one\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nYeah so uh   it 's more of the bread  \n\n<$A> \n\n Maybe the Americans   made uh did the, uh\n\n<$B> \n\nPopularized some form of\n\n<$A> \n\nYes  another yeast another bread to make pizza another kind of dough\n\n\nThat 's why we have our pizzas right now\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I guess it 's also the the kind of of of treating the dough\n\n\nDon't they throw the dough in the air and   clip it  in and   punch it in  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n But they usually roll it out   thinly\n\n<$B> \n\n  And  twirl it\n\n<$A> \n\n But   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nDon't they do that with pizzas\n\n\nI mean   do you  do you remember the the the that restaurant the Italian Village\n\n<$A> \n\n Pizza dough   \n\n<$B> \n\n  Uhm  \n\n<$A> \n\n In   Quezon Avenue\n\n<$B> \n\nQuezon Avenue   and also  one in I think in in EDSA\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nThey they originated Italian pizza here\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThey popularized Italian pizzas   before Shakey 's came out here  \n\n<$A> \n\n But they   they serve thick crust pizzas\n\n<$B> \n\nThey serve all kinds of pizzas\n\n\nBut the point is they popularized pizza in the Philippines\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I didn't know even before Shakey 's\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah even before Shakey 's even before Shakey shook\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat 's Shakey shook\n\n<$B> \n\nShakey shook the pizza\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> 1 word </unclear> Shakey 's  \n\n\nOkay so what else\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm about pizzas\n\n<$B> \n\nPizzas and uh, \n\n<$A> \n\nWhat else\n\n<$B> \n\nWell the Italians also have aside from\n\n\nDon't pasta come from flour as well\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah they do\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so\n\n<$A> \n\nBut did you know that pasta originated from China\n\n\nIt didn't   really  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nI think   Marco Polo  \n\n<$A> \n\n As noodles   \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah   Marco Polo  \n\n<$A> \n\n As noodles   and then Marco Polo brought the same concept   but  instead of using\n\n<$B> \n\n To   \n\n\nIs Marco Polo Italian, \n\n<$A> \n\nNo he was Portuguese\n\n<$B> \n\nWas he  \n\n\n  He was  \n\n<$A> \n\n Portuguese    di ba  \n\n<$B> \n\nHe was Portuguese\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay I think he was Portugese\n\n\nSo what were we what were we talking about\n\n<$B> \n\nI think we were talking about pastas\n\n<$A> \n\nPastas uhm it originally came from   Italy   ay  China as noodles right\n\n<$B> \n\n China   \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then Marco Polo brought it to Italy\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd they used flour instead of using\n\n<$B> \n\nRice\n\n<$A> \n\nRice yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWell and then the Italians popularized it\n\n\nBut I think I suppose well there are the Chinese also   have been  \n\n<$A> \n\n Popularized   noodles\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah and I think they also have uh different recipes for different kinds of noodles\n\n<$A> \n\nYes they have   it  in soup\n\n<$B> \n\n There   there there are rice noodles glass noodles\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm egg noodles\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm okay I thought it was how you use them\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but but they have different kinds of recipes for that   don't they  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nYes they do\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm I think the Chinese are more adventurous and more innovative in terms of their recipes in the world\n\n\nI think they are\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Chinese\n\n<$B> \n\nI think so\n\n\nI mean they have different recipes for, different kinds of of of of uh food or ingredient\n\n\nThey almost they use almost everything in uh\n\n<$A> \n\nCan't you say the same for Filipinos\n\n\n  For example in  \n\n<$B> \n\n Not really   \n\n\nIf you look at   the recipe yeah you  \n\n<$A> \n\n If you have your  pig  you can eat   everything\n\n<$B> \n\nYes but if you look at the Chinese recipe or the Chinese if you go to a Chinese restaurant for example they have more choices rather than Filipinos in terms of of their uhm food\n\n\nLike uh and I think they I think\n\n<$A> \n\nBut they only\n\n<$B> \n\nThey are equally as as uh as uh, uhm, they 're equally as as uh adventurous in terms of their recipes compared to the Thais\n\n\nWell the Thais have Chinese influences as well\n\n<$A> \n\nBut they usually use the same cooking   method  \n\n<$B> \n\n They use   \n\n\nNo   no not really  \n\n<$A> \n\n Where they   stir-fry steam\n\n<$B> \n\nNot really\n\n\nBut the ingredients they use are the Chinese are more   have more  ingredients\n\n<$A> \n\n Adventurous   \n\n<$B> \n\nThey they uh they uh they, they 're tastier\n\n\nThey have  varieties of of of uh of ways of cooking things like uh\n\n<$A> \n\nI I can also say the same thing for Italians\n\n\nI think it depends   on  \n\n<$B> \n\n Not   really\n\n\nI   don't think  Italians are the  the same as uh   the Chinese  I think\n\n<$A> \n\n Why   \n\n\n Yes   \n\n<$B> \n\nChinese have more ingredients rather than the Italians\n\n\nThe Italians are well they 're typically\n\n<$A> \n\nThey have their olive oil   there 's tomatoes  the garlic\n\n<$B> \n\n Western meals   \n\n\nExactly they have that\n\n<$A> \n\nThe anchovies the capers but that 's basically it\n\n\n  Yeah  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   but Chinese have  wansoy  \n\n<$A> \n\n I can see your point   \n\n<$B> \n\nThey have uh they use ginger a lot\n\n\nThey use garlic they use onions a lot\n\n\nThey use cornstarch a lot\n\n\nThey use uh soy sauce sesame seed oil uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBut don't   they usually  taste the same\n\n<$B> \n\n <unclear> 1 word </unclear> oil   \n\n\nNo I don't know\n\n\nI don't think so I don't think so\n\n\nThere 's this Szechwan style of cooking\n\n\nThere 's a Mandarin style of   cooking  \n\n<$A> \n\n What 's   the Szechwan style of   cooking  \n\n<$B> \n\n Szechwan   I think is more uh spicy\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd more, darker in color presentation as compared to the Cantonese which is more based on cornstarch\n\n\nAnd I think it is more uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYou mean the sauce is like\n\n<$B> \n\nThe one   that is very  \n\n<$A> \n\n Sauce-based   \n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nVery sauce-based\n\n\nThe Mandarin I think is is is uh is with I think the Mandarin is because\n\n<$A> \n\nSteamed the dumplings \n\n<$B> \n\n The Mandarin   cooking I think is primarily served for kings and therefore they 're more   uh  \n\n<$A> \n\n Really   \n\n<$B> \n\nI think so\n\n<$A> \n\nI 've never really read anything about   Chinese cooking  \n\n<$B> \n\n It 's very interesting   if you if you look into\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nChinese cooking\n\n\nThe way they prepare uh their their food uh it 's sort of a ritual uhm because there 's a certain uh cultural value attached to on their  ,  their food \n\n<$A> \n\n Well   \n\n\nAren't the French supposedly the the the  parang  the father of all cuisines\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't think so\n\n\nUh well that 's because you know Westerners they they tend to they 're very ethnocentric\n\n\nThey think that they are the the superior race   or  superior culture\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't think so\n\n\nBut when it comes I think to food I think it 's the Chinese that are more more uh adroit\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat do you mean\n\n<$B> \n\nThey 're more adaptive\n\n\nThey 're more uh innovative\n\n\nThey 're uh they they, they tend to use ingredients in so many ways\n\n\nThey they easily modify their their recipes, plus the fact also that the Chinese enjoy their food a lot\n\n\nI think\n\n\nRather than the than the French, uh they have the classic recipes but that 's about it I think uh\n\n<$A> \n\nAny deviations they usually do\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I think it 's because also of a certain form of an elite culture or class attributed the French to be the uh the world class cuisine which I I really don't uh agree or subscribe to\n\n\nI think it 's the Chinese\n\n\nAnd I think what we know here in the Philippines is is uh is nothing compared to to what the Chinese really can do in terms of their food or in terms of real Chinese cooking\n\n\nI suppose that when one goes to Beijing or or Peking or Hunan or or any other Chinese   province  they discover a whole different world of cooking\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nI can't say that for Filipinos because you tend to see the same thing wherever you go\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAlthough it 's the Kapampangans that are known to be more of the cuisine type\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut that 's about it\n\n\nFor example can you   think of any  \n\n<$A> \n\n How about the   Bicolanos\n\n<$B> \n\nFor the Bicolanos it 's like this\n\n\nYou go to the north you   the Ilocos region  \n\n<$A> \n\n The Ilocanos   \n\n<$B> \n\nYou have the   you have you have  \n\n<$A> \n\n  Pinak-   pakbet  \n\n<$B> \n\nYou have signature recipes\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n Pinakbet  uhm  dinengdeng  uh    pinikpikan   \n\n<$A> \n\n That pork one   that pork\n\n<$B> \n\n Bagnet  \n\n<$A> \n\n Bagnet  \n\n<$B> \n\nYou have those\n\n\nWhen you go to Pampanga oh you have a lot of recipes\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat do you call those crickets that they eat, \n\n<$B> \n\n cucaracha  no  kutkut   I don't know\n\n\nUh you go to Bicol\n\n\nYou talk about Bicol express\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat exactly is Bicol express\n\n<$B> \n\nI think it 's chili peppers\n\n<$A> \n\nSo it 's any kind of\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's chili peppers   cooked  in in ground pork and uh\n\n<$A> \n\n Ingredient   \n\n\nIt 's always   ground pork  \n\n<$B> \n\n Coconut milk   \n\n\nI think ground pork because uh pork is the more   popular  \n\n<$A> \n\n It 's like   your  sisig  but it 's with    gata    \n\n<$B> \n\n No   yeah but no this is ground pork is just the the secondary ingredient\n\n\nIt 's really the chopped chilies that 's the main ingredient\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you 're eating chilies\n\n<$B> \n\nYou 're actually eating chilies\n\n<$A> \n\nI thought it was   just like  \n\n<$B> \n\n And the oil   that 's coming  the oil used for saut\u00e9ing comes from the pork\n\n\nThat 's simply it\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then you   put that  \n\n<$A> \n\n I always   thought Bicol express was\n\n<$B> \n\nYou put that away you mix it

him\n\n<$A> \n\nParalyzed\n\n<$B> \n\nSort of paralyzed\n\n\nSo he had, no she noticed scars all over the King 's body and stuff,  and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah he knows stuff like that  actually healed\n\n\nBut then there were lots of them all over his body\n\n\nAfter a few months, the King died\n\n\nSo\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nThe whole kingdom was sorrowful because their King was already gone\n\n<$A> \n\nSo, \n\n<$B> \n\nWhat 's that noise\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know\n\n<$B> \n\nThis building is too much\n\n\nOkay so, after the King 's death, of course the child the Princess, the tendency of the child is to become, sad   because , her father is already dead right\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh  , \n\n\nUh-huh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nSo the the child the little Princess she came to, the Queen 's bedroom\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo the Queen understanding the situation that the child is in, she openly comforted the child\n\n\nUhm she hugged the Princess you know comforted her\n\n\nBut then, you know what happened\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm what\n\n<$B> \n\nWell, the Princess bit her\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\nDon't know, it 's just said in the story that the Princess bit her, \n\n\nAnd then you know what the Princess did\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat\n\n<$B> \n\nWell, she just sucked blood from the wound\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Queen sucked blood from the wound\n\n<$B> \n\nNo the child\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy, is she a Dracula or something\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know, but then the child kept on sucking blood from, the Queen 's wound\n\n\nSo the Queen fainted at the sight that the  the little child was sucking blood from her arm\n\n\nSo next morning, when the Queen woke up uhm she was at the foot of her bed, \n\n<$A> \n\nThe Queen\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah, because she fainted right\n\n\nSo when she woke up she saw that there was a faint scar\n\n<$A> \n\nWhere\n\n<$B> \n\nAt her arm where the little child the Princess was sucking last night, \n\n<$A> \n\nHow old is that Princess\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Princess is about, fourteen fifteen, or sixteen\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nSo, when the Queen saw that scar at her arm she was scared because she remembered that the the King remember the King\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nHe had scars all over his body before he became bedridden\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo what she concluded was that the little child was responsible for the King 's death\n\n\nSo uhm, she steered clear of the Princess\n\n\n  She,  \n\n<$A> \n\n Wait   wait wait is the Queen also bedridden by then\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n\nRemember she was only bitten once\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo what she did was she stayed away from the Princess\n\n\nShe tried avoiding avoiding the Princess because she didn't want to end up like the King as in dead\n\n\nOkay so she barricaded her doors at night so that the Princess couldn't get in and suck more blood from her\n\n<$A> \n\nWhere did the Princess go\n\n<$B> \n\nWell the Princess stayed at her quarters at her bedroom of course\n\n\nBut then they always found these animals as in deers, uhm, little birds dead without, a trace of blood in their body left\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nSo one day, the Queen, as scared as frightened as she was, because she has power like in   POLIGOV   \n\n<$A> \n\n Wait wait  wait that 's a fairy tale right\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah, I told you it was a twisted version, okay\n\n\nSo one day,   she  , \n\n<$A> \n\n Oh oh   it 's raining\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh I hate the rain, because my, cupcake gets wet  'no  \n\n\nOkay back to the fairy tale okay so one day she ordered a huntsman to take the Princess to the forest\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause she has power right\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nSo so she ordered the huntsman to take the heart of the Princess you know take it back to her after he kills her\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know I think I heard about that, you know the taking of the heart   and then  \n\n<$B> \n\n Okay so   what fairy tale is it\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know  \n\n<$B> \n\nUh you don't know, uh how can you be like that\n\n\nOkay let 's continue with the story\n\n\nSo the huntsman, of course he will do the job for a price  ,  as in lots of gold jewelry\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nWait wait I know the  the huntsman   right  the huntsman didn't, get the heart of the Princess\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nUh that was in the other story\n\n\nThis is the twisted version remember\n\n\nSo the huntsman took the Princess to the forest and then he did take the heart, and then, he brought it back to the Queen and then the Queen, well, she hung the heart, over her dresser\n\n<$A> \n\n  She 's  so cruel\n\n<$B> \n\n So she 's   \n\n\nUhm, you might say that\n\n\nSo she hung the heart at her dresser and then, the funny thing, the horrifying thing is, the heart continued beating, even without the body\n\n<$A> \n\nWithout a blood\n\n<$B> \n\nWithout blood, it just continued beating and beating and beating for years\n\n\nOkay let 's go back to, okay so, the huntsman killed the Princess right\n\n\nSo, there were, dwarfs who found the body of the Princess\n\n<$A> \n\nUh it 's like Snow White\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah you finally got it okay\n\n\nSo, it is a twisted version of Snow White\n\n\nSo, there were dwarfs who found the body of the Princess and you know what they did\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat\n\n<$B> \n\nThey built a coffin\n\n<$A> \n\nHuh   then  \n\n<$B> \n\n Okay   so, they built a coffin for the dead Princess,   and  \n\n<$A> \n\n I know   what happened next\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then after that uh maybe a year later or something something and then the Prince will come\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so uhm it goes like that but you missed a lot of details\n\n\nOkay so here it is\n\n\nSo they built this coffin for the Princess\n\n\nIt was made of glass as in all glass\n\n\nSo they, carried her coffin, up to a hill\n\n\nSo they left their coffin there so that, uhm people could see her\n\n\nSo after a few years as you said after a few  a few years a Prince came\n\n<$A> \n\nWait wait wait, this is I think the dwarfs don't know Snow White\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah they don't know Snow White in this story in my story okay\n\n<$A> \n\nWell, why did they build a coffin for her\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause they pitied her because she was dead\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so a prince came to the Kingdom\n\n\nSo what happened was that this Prince he was a weird Prince, \n\n\nYou know why\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause, he didn't\n\n<$A> \n\nWait wait wait, is he like your cupcake\n\n<$B> \n\nNo he 's not like my cupcake\n\n<$A> \n\n  Oh okay  \n\n<$B>

\n\n Wait wait wait,   you know, I think Prince Prince a Prince look like  ano  tall and then white and then have uh long hair and then you know everything kind of like\n\n<$B> \n\nSo what so he   smiles  \n\n<$A> \n\n But   but but he 's not cute okay\n\n<$B> \n\nOh my\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay continue with your   story  \n\n<$B> \n\n Okay   let 's continue\n\n\nI 'll get back, at you later\n\n\nOkay so, the Prince he was weird because, he was like what you mentioned a Dracula\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nNo not really a Dracula but he was extremely pale, and\n\n<$A> \n\nIs he the Dracula\n\n<$B> \n\nNo he 's not the Dracula\n\n\nHe is extremely pale and he 's, eerily silent he 's always silent   and then  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah yeah   like my prince who 's always\n\n<$B> \n\nSilent\n\n\nSo what happened was like this, uhm the Prince and the Queen had an affair, \n\n\nBut the weird thing is the Prince didn't want any motion\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n\nWhat motion\n\n<$B> \n\n Motion, he didn't want the Queen, to move, as, they were\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay\n\n<$B> \n\n   as they were  having intercourse\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay  \n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so that 's the weird part okay\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Prince\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Prince didn't want the Queen to move\n\n<$A> \n\nSo the Prince and the Queen did something\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah they had an affair\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so, the Queen\n\n<$A> \n\nWait wait how old how old is that Prince\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Prince is about twenty\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then the Queen\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Queen is about, twenty-eight\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause she 's a stepmother remember\n\n<$A> \n\nOh stepmother   yeah  \n\n<$B> \n\n Okay   so, the Queen kept on squirming\n\n\nShe kept on moving so the Prince, he was, angry\n\n\nHe became angry because the Queen didn't follow his orders   you know  to keep still so what he did was he left the castle so he left the castle\n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\nWait wait wait a while ago it is raining but now it 's not\n\n<$B> \n\nGood for us\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so he left the castle and he, he traveled the kingdom as in he went through the forest and then that 's where he found the Princess Princess Snow White\n\n<$A> \n\nOh Snow White\n\n<$B> \n\nSo he was shall we say enchanted by the beauty of Snow White so what he did was, he he made love with her and because Snow White 's

captain guy he was so, he was so stubborn and and he didn't he didn't want to listen to the group  ,  about the storm and they had a choice to to make a short cut through the storm or to wait or go around it, and but reach home later compared to taking the short cut\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nYeah I think it 's nice but then you know I 'm not so into those  ,  \n\n\nThose natural disaster stuff

\n\n<$A> \n\n It 's not   so, so exciting or something\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah it 's not realistic in a way because it doesn't I don't know it doesn't happen in  here\n\n\nIt doesn't happen uh uh it 's just

there was something wrong with the script\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n\nWhat\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nIt was flat it was it wasn't\n\n<$A> \n\nUh  uh okay but then I heard everyone saying  na  it 's nice

loved it but then is it if you 're asking me, uhm, the story was I don't know\n\n\nIt was weird\n\n\nIt revolved around some this this lady but, the story that   happened  \n\n<$A> \n\n But   is it uh it 's not  it 's not a comedy film it 's not a comedy   movie  \n\n<$B> \n\n It was   a comedy it was a comedy\n\n\nBut uhm when you when\n\n<$A> \n\nBut it ended like low\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\n Parang  it 's,   low  \n\n<$B> \n\n Low   I don't know low\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nIt it didn't have much of a story   the ending  wasn't that nice\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh okay  \n\n<$B> \n\n E  it was nice it was a happy ending but, uh action scenes there were action scenes I guess\n\n<$A> \n\nUh what about action movies\n\n\nDo you like it\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm pretty much   okay  \n\n<$A> \n\n Some   some of them right like   ay  what 's \" Mission \" like thrillers and all those\n\n<$B> \n\nMission Mission \n\n<$A> \n\nMission Impossible and all those\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I haven't I haven't   watched  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh you   haven't watched\n\n\nIt 's kind of nice\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's action right I mean <unclear> 3 words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah yeah   I kinda like action  \n\n<$B> \n\n I wanna watch   X-Men\n\n<$A> \n\nX-Men \n\n\n  Really  \n\n<$B> \n\n The movie   \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know, yeah uhm, X-Men, I 'm not really into those you know these  ninja ninja kung fu    X-Men  \n\n<$B> \n\n It 's not    ninja  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh you know those cartoon turned movies   are  I don't know\n\n<$B> \n\n You know I   \n\n<$A> \n\n  I don't like X-Men

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood morning Lulu\n\n\nGood morning  uh Lito\n\n\nHow are you today\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I 'm fine thank you\n\n\nBut the rains are quite bad\n\n<$A> \n\nUh did you experience any traffic problems on the way to the office\n\n<$B> \n\nApparently there are less people traveling now because of the weather\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I heard in the news that uh this morning the elementary and high school uh students uh are are excused to go to the school right now, but in certain areas I think only\n\n\nNot not in the entire uh N C R  but in certain areas like Manila Malabon Navotas Marikina\n\n\nBut I think in Para&ntilde;aque there is still school\n\n<$B> \n\nQuezon City also has school\n\n<$A> \n\nWell last night the weather the the rain was so hard and uh it caused a lot of flood\n\n\nOur street was flooded again\n\n<$B> \n\nI think this is basically because of the typhoon that got stuck in uh the Balintang Channel\n\n\nIt hasn't moved and it has been uh triggering the monsoon in Manila even though we are not covered by typhoon signal number one\n\n<$A> \n\nBut this weather disturbance uh uh is quite quite uh much better compared to last year  'no  \n\n\nI think last year we experienced much much worse uh uh rainfall  'no  when we had a lot of big floods \n\n<$B> \n\nBut I think this one is also a major disaster because so many towns in Bulacan are under water up to now\n\n\nAnd many believe that the water will stay there for some time\n\n\nIt has not receded\n\n<$A> \n\nWell in uh Pampanga also I think there is again uh a report about a problem on road road uh uh  uh you know the the water is uh the bridges are you know are almost   being  overflowed overflowed uh\n\n<$C> \n\n All the roads are flooded   \n\n<$B> \n\nWashed away\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$C> \n\n Lahar  has been washed away again, \n\n<$A> \n\nAny problems on your uh\n\n<$C> \n\nWhat about your farm Lits\n\n\nIt 's under water\n\n<$A> \n\n Well uh in Zambales I think it 's a high high area\n\n\nDo you do we experience uh flooding in that area\n\n<$B> \n\nWell my area is in the mountains so there 's no flooding\n\n\nBut uh if the rains continue the  you know the land becomes very soaked in water and we could say it 's water-logged\n\n\nAnd some of the, it 's not stable anymore\n\n\nSome of the loose soil uh slide down in the slope\n\n<$C> \n\nToo much water will destroy your crops\n\n<$A> \n\nYou mean to say that there are a lot of cut trees also in your area\n\n<$B> \n\nNo actually we are planting trees\n\n\nWe are allocating one hectare just for the forest\n\n\nWe are reforesting the place and uh it will be a very it will be high density\n\n\nUh we are putting hardwood trees in that uh particular hectare\n\n<$A> \n\nBut uh is it difficult to reach your area when it 's uh rainy season or\n\n<$B> \n\nWell there 's a road\n\n\nYou can reach the area but it 's difficult to walk in the farm because of the\n\n\nIt 's a slope so you could slide\n\n<$A> \n\nBut the problem is uh you have to pass Pampanga in order to reach  ,  Zambales \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh   \n\n\nWe go via Pangasinan\n\n<$A> \n\nPangasinan\n\n\nBut it 's a long way  e  \n\n<$B> \n\nUh you add one and a half hours to the trip\n\n<$C> \n\nJust to reach your place\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nBut uh during this time I don't think the fruits uh prices are down because of uh of this weather\n\n<$B> \n\nMany crops will be damaged so I assume uh you have to pay a high price for your vegetables\n\n<$A> \n\nI think even fishponds uh have problems right now\n\n<$C> \n\nOverflowing\n\n<$A> \n\n yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nSo many many of the neighbors will be very happy because they can get fish for free  ha  \n\n<$C> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you see uh Mr the the President uh looking at the uh Manila Bay area\n\n\n  There is  so much garbage  ha  \n\n<$C> \n\n Yeah yeah   \n\n\nYeah that 's right\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh a year ago they had this advertisement saying that if you throw your garbage it 's gonna come back   to you  \n\n<$C> \n\n Come back   \n\n\nIt will come back to you\n\n<$B> \n\nSo today uh  ,  that has become a reality and the garbage has come back to us \n\n<$C> \n\n It 's gonna come back to you   \n\n<$A> \n\nI didn't know that uh some of the uh garbage guys are disposing their garbage in the sea  ha  \n\n<$C> \n\nPeople along the squatter area they just dispose their garbage\n\n<$B> \n\nBasically the main problem is the attitude\n\n\nThis they want to keep themselves clean but they don't take the responsibility of cleaning their environment\n\n\nThe I think it 's very typical of Filipinos\n\n\nThey are very clean with themselves but outside around them they don't maintain it clean\n\n<$C> \n\nYou mean they clean themselves without cleaning their surroundings Lits\n\n\nIt follows sometimes that\n\n<$B> \n\nThey don't care whether\n\n<$C> \n\nIt reflects your personality\n\n\nOnce you keep yourself clean you also keep your surroundings clean\n\n<$B> \n\nNot really\n\n\nUh they will throw their garbage at their neighbor 's place\n\n<$C> \n\nIt is because they live in a surrounding which is not really that clean so naturally it comes you know  in the way they live\n\n<$B> \n\nBut Filipinos normally are clean with themselves\n\n\nThey know how to take a bath every day even though they are in the squatter area\n\n<$C> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut where they dispose their garbage God knows\n\n<$C> \n\nBecause the garbage problem is not really a problem that you keep to yourself\n\n\nIt 's an it 's an economic and social problem\n\n\nIt 's a problem of the the city  di ba  \n\n\nHow how you dispose of your garbage  ,  that 's one reason \n\n<$B> \n\n Talking of   \n\n\nSpeaking of uh disposing of garbage I think they have opened again the uh this   garbage dump  in Tondo\n\n<$C> \n\n Landfill   \n\n\nSmokey\n\n<$B> \n\nSmokey Mountain\n\n<$C> \n\nSmokey Mountain\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$C> \n\n  They 're dumping again  \n\n<$A> \n\n Because I think uh   the the current uh dumping ground in Payatas I think is scheduled to be closed so\n\n<$B> \n\n  Yes  \n\n<$A> \n\n The   one that 's in uh the one that is located in uh near Antipolo\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's going to be closed by the end of the year and I think uh the Metro Manila Authority has not found a suitable replacement up to this point in time\n\n\nThey were thinking of Cavite but uh the I think the local government people there does not allow this to happen because it will cause a lot of environmental problems\n\n<$C> \n\nI think no one nobody\n\n<$B> \n\nLikes garbage\n\n<$C> \n\nLikes garbage\n\n<$A> \n\nHow could they do it in other countries\n\n\nDo you do you know of any of the systems that is being done in the other countries\n\n<$B> \n\nWell most uh countries they do they have a recycling program where bottles or plastics are stored in or thrown in a special uh disposal area\n\n\nLet 's say all bottles are consolidated uh all papers are also consolidated in one area and then these are all recycled\n\n\nAnd then let 's say organic garbage such as uh kitchen refuse\n\n\nNormally it goes to their sewage system because they have what we call uhm digester in their sinks\n\n\nWell in the Philippines our sewage system exists only in Manila and especially in the old part of Manila and the rest they don't have the sewage system\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd the system in Manila is an old system way way back pre-war years I think\n\n<$B> \n\nYes it 's pre-war years and that 's why in certain uh houses in Malate Ermita they don't have uhm septic tanks because it 's all disposed in the sewage system separate\n\n\nThe rest of us the rest of the areas make use of the septic tank\n\n<$A> \n\nAnother thing that uh the problem of Manila is the transportation  ano  \n\n\nThey could not organize themselves in such a way that uh it will be advantageous to the people you know like for example in in other countries they have this uh well organized uh\n\n<$C> \n\nMass transport system\n\n<$A> \n\nMass transport\n\n\nOf course we have already started the M T R  the L R T  but uh we need to have more\n\n<$C> \n\nHopefully\n\n<$A> \n\nI think we need to have more\n\n\nI think we have to have good links with this uh rail system when after the people are going down in their station they have connections\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah\n\n\nYou know Jun how I wish they they had you know built a train along along the South Super Highway rather than built that Skyway because it will be more advantageous if they ever did the train thing\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah but they\n\n<$C> \n\nThen I won't be able to bring my car to Makati   anymore  \n\n<$B> \n\n No need   to bring\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah but the other thing I heard that uh Ayala is   uh  thinking of that\n\n<$C> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nSupposed to be\n\n<$A> \n\nThat uh that that that  project\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah supposed to be\n\n\nBut I 'd I hope Ayala will not change its mind\n\n<$A> \n\nEspecially now   that uh  the the oil prices are uncontrollable  ha  \n\n<$C> \n\n Its mind   \n\n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know it 's so expensive\n\n<$C> \n\nIt 's not easy to bring your\n\n<$A> \n\nI think the   the more they raise it  the more our economy will be affected uh negatively because it might cause some recession\n\n<$C> \n\n Your car every day   \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd uh you you can also notice our economy our economic situation right now is not in at its best\n\n\nYou can see that the Philippine peso has gone down to\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nForty-four to one again\n\n\nOne U S dollar is in fact uh some of them are projecting that this will go up up to forty-six pesos\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd this will affect the cost of fuel  'no  \n\n<$C> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause first the cost of money and then the cost also of the oil\n\n\nIt 's quite the oil has increased in cost although Saudi Arabia is trying to produce more to bring down the cost of the oil\n\n<$A> \n\nThis will be a domino effect again\n\n\nNow when we increase the oil prices prices of goods will go up and then uh the workers will demand\n\n<$C> \n\nThen people will demand for more wages\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n\nAnd then what will be the result\n\n\nWe will not be competitive in the world market anymore\n\n<$B> \n\nI think we no longer are competitive\n\n\nWe 're only good for, expensive items, or specialty items that can be only produced here but if they cannot be produced here\n\n\nNormally the other countries like Thailand China Indonesia and especially maybe the former communist countries like Burma and maybe in the near future North Korea will be, uh benefiting from the the world market because of the they have lower prices\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause in the year two zero zero four it 's going to be a global uh world market uh there will be no more import restrictions\n\n\n  Whoever can  produce  the cheapest and high quality uh will will be able to be the successful one\n\n<$C> \n\n No more quotas   \n\n<$B> \n\nBut I think that 's a very myopic view from the point of view of the, of the rich countries\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat do you mean \" myopic \" why\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause they only look from their own point of view\n\n\nActually the ones who benefit are the rich countries\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you mean   do you mean  \n\n<$B> \n\n Poor countries   will become poorer\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you mean to say that we should still impose uh import restrictions\n\n<$B> \n\nI believe so\n\n<$C> \n\n  In a way  \n\n<$A> \n\n To protect   the local industries\n\n<$C> \n\nIn a way that will help us\n\n\nThat 's a commitment, \n\n<$B> \n\nWhat do you mean \" commitment \" \n\n<$C> \n\nCommitment\n\n\nIf there are quotas I am committed to   share  this much \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh   yes\n\n\nOf course\n\n<$C> \n\nBecause there are still restrictions restraints quantitative limits but if there are no  it 's a global market so everybody is fighting for for his own product\n\n\nWho buys the best who buys the cheapest\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's true\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd uh you can see the development in the uh in the I T  ha  in the Information Technology\n\n\nA lot of people are using now the what is called the E commerce the electronic commerce\n\n\nAnd it 's very popular that uh a lot of companies are putting up their own web websites or web browsers or something like that, \n\n\nUh what do you think\n\n\nDo you think\n\n\nEven our company I think is uh going to come up with this kind of uh operations wherein the we will put up a  website and then interlink it with our uh business partners like uh\n\n<$C> \n\nLike our suppliers\n\n<$A> \n\nLike our suppliers and then accessory suppliers\n\n\nYou know they can put these goods suppliers they can put input there the latest uh   prices  \n\n<$C> \n\n Products   that they have\n\n<$A> \n\nPrices and then the suppliers can uh immediately come up with their own uh selling prices based on those things\n\n<$C> \n\nSo you can actually do your shopping using the Internet\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah shopping I think is now now more feasible in by using the Internet\n\n<$B> \n\nIs that what they call \"

Heidelberg\n\n<$A> \n\nI was there a year ago\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's a beautiful city\n\n<$A> \n\nWell it 's a it 's a university town huh\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's a , \n\n\nHow about the the University of Leeds\n\n\nIs that is Leeds supposed to be a town or\n\n<$B> \n\nWell Leeds used to be an industrial town they produced wool  ,  textiles and the university was built because of the woolen industry\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nYes then philosophy evolved and philosophy and literature\n\n<$A> \n\nI heard from uh Vic Brias that uh the the author of a of our book Alistair Macintyre\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nHe 's supposed to have taught in the University of Leeds\n\n<$B> \n\nI 've no idea\n\n<$A> \n\nThey told me once, yes\n\n<$B> \n\nProbably, probably before I was there\n\n<$A> \n\nHow 'd you find that book of uh Macintyre\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's good although I had to get used to the language  ,  uh it 's not Anglo-American so it takes getting used to\n\n<$A> \n\n \n\n\nI uh my comment is that uh I think Macintyre is uh getting into a problematic into that problematic of uh what we call \" postmodernism \" like that of <unclear> 1 word </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know anything about <unclear> 1 word </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh, postmodernism\n\n<$B> \n\nPostmodernism uh although I have heard people mentioning the word but I 've never really <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nLet me see let me see\n\n\nLet me recall how Macintyre gets into this problem\n\n\nUh based on this book \" After Virtue \" that very title \" After Virtue \" I think it 's postmodernist because \" virtue \" you know \" After Virtue \" what uh it it it gets you into thinking about the the the phase, \n\n\nI think the cultural phase in which, something of the past, is uh going through a threshold, being questioned, being transformed and uh precisely at the point where you don't yet know exactly what the, what it is that it 's going to be transformed into, \n\n\nNow it doesn't uh, \n\n<$B> \n\nWell so far somebody told me I 'm not really sure about this you have to correct me then\n\n\nSome people say that postmodernism is sort of a critique of all forms of meta-narrative something  ,  it 's anti-foundationalist, uh I 'm not really sure uh I may be talking my head off\n\n<$A> \n\nYes uh, \n\n\nMaybe if we we could say it is anti uhm, anti-modernism\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm of course that begs the question of what is modernism\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's a critique of a of the modern spirit and so again the question of uh what is the modern spirit isn't it\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it also a going back to the classical <unclear> 1 word </unclear> it 's not\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's not   it 's not  a going back\n\n<$B> \n\n It 's not   \n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's a moving on it 's a, it 's going forward, without having to I hope without having to lose the heritage of the past\n\n\nBecause for example this uh book of Macintyre while it is it is speaking of something \" After Virtue \" is contextualizing itself within history isn't it, \n\n\nThere 's a great deal of of  history in uh Macintyre, \n\n<$B> \n\nWell, I have to you know think about that\n\n<$A> \n\nYou think about it\n\n\nThere is however a kind of post-modernism which is uh also anti-history\n\n\nAn example will be uhm will be somebody who is Nietzschean who is radically, negativist, \n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo\n\n<$B> \n\nWhose  postmodernism could be a sort of umbrella term for a lot of things but they could share certain assumptions\n\n\nIs it like that\n\n<$A> \n\nIncluding that, but generally it is uhm, it is it has a historical dimension because uh we are supposed to be going through through a stage, a stage in history in which we are no longer we no longer belong to the modern age\n\n\nIn other words the modern age is past in the same way that there was a time when the medieval age was uh was past, \n\n\nAnd uh we are moving into a new epoch\n\n\nWe don't have a name for it yet so we call it \" post-modern \" \n\n<$B> \n\nSo what characterizes this as you as you say it new epoch\n\n<$A> \n\nAt this point of the game uh the general  character of this epoch is one of critique the critique of the immediate past,  \n\n<$B> \n\n I see\n\n<$A> \n\nSo there 's something new in, I I think post-modernism is uh is optimistic about about the future that there 's something new in the offing, \n\n\nAnd you can see that even politically because uh everywhere in the world something 's going on right, \n\n\nChanges right and left, \n\n\nThese are no longer the same as before\n\n\nSo new time is a new epoch\n\n\nDon't you feel that way, \n\n<$B> \n\nNo, no not really\n\n<$A> \n\nNot really , \n\n\nAre you enjoying your classes, \n\n<$B> \n\nYes, oh I enjoy the the the graduate class\n\n<$A> \n\nThe graduate class I see, I see, \n\n<$B> \n\nHey I hear you have plans to introduce computerized logic teaching   in La Salle  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd so that will relieve the teachers to, to discuss to discourse more on the philosophical issues involved in logic \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm yeah\n\n\nWhen you come back I think uh we should uh think along those lines\n\n\nDesign courses and uh, 'cause I have done this tradition also with <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\n'Cause when I was in Leeds they they they had the they had this logic interaction with with computers and it 's it 's\n\n\nThe computer really teaches you how to because if you make some for example if you  devise  something wrong the computer will give you a feedback it 'll say it 's wrong like that\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's very good\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm we don't have that yet here\n\n<$B> \n\nI know\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know it 's Raymond 's birthday also\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I heard, \n\n\nSo when is the, \n\n<$A> \n\nWhen is the\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen is the lunch going to start or are we just waiting\n\n<$A> \n\nWe 're just waiting, we 're just waiting\n\n\nBut the food is here right\n\n<$B> \n\nActually I have had my lunch, \n\n<$A> \n\nYou haven't received word from uh where 's that\n\n<$B> \n\nFinland\n\n<$A> \n\nFinland\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I haven't yet, I think they 're supposed to deliberate on it after the end of March\n\n<$A> \n\nOh and then you 'll hear from them\n\n<$B> \n\nApril May\n\n<$A> \n\nApril May, and then  just in case you uh get accepted when you when do you are you supposed to go\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's my choice actually\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's your choice\n\n<$B> \n\nMy choice\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh, you don't want to teach uh for the first term\n\n<$B> \n\nWell it depends\n\n\nYeah, because uh, I 'm not really sure what I want to do yet with my life actually\n\n\nBefore I was so sure but then

type it out\n\n\nIt 's very tiring\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n\nBut uh what 's your contract with them\n\n\nIs there a stipulation time or\n\n<$B> \n\nWell it 's until the end of May\n\n<$A> \n\nOh   until  the end of May\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nYeah, it 's until the end of May <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nHow would you like teaching for the first term graduate school, logic\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I 'll, I 'll I 'll see about that yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nMay June July\n\n<$B> \n\nAbout May June July, \n\n\nYeah, \n\n<$A> \n\nHave you met Dr Quito, \n\n\nHave you, talked to her\n\n<$B> \n\nNot

she does not have a meeting\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nShe 'll be very open to you, \n\n<$B> \n\nI enjoyed it very much when she went to England to see <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\n Oo nga daw   ano   \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   that was very nice\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm, she visited you at the university\n\n<$B> \n\nNo she she was in London uh I went down from Leeds to London\n\n<$A> \n\nOh is it a distance\n\n<$B> \n\nTwo hundred fifty miles\n\n<$A> \n\nTwo hundred fifty miles\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's uh four hundred kilometers\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh, that 's quite a distance huh\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but the train is fast two and a half hours\n\n<$A> \n\nTwo and a half hours\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah fast train, \n\n\nI 'm going to see Dr Reyes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd you left each other there\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no I wrote to him\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh and I so I\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you know that both of you were coming this year\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I had no idea\n\n<$A> \n\nNo idea\n\n<$B> \n\nUh yeah I only knew it when I came in I think that was the Friday before the start of term\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd the secretary said that uh <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nI was supposed to meet uh Prof Quito in Paris\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah uh after she visited me she would be going to Spain then France and I would see her in Paris\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nShe gave me her address in Paris\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut then something came up uh I went to Liechtenstein which is a small country between\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes\n\n<$B> \n\nI went there instead and uhm Germany Switzerland I sent her a postcard, \n\n<$A> \n\nLuxembourg, uh Luxembourg\n\n<$B> \n\nLuxembourg is nice, \n\n<$A> \n\nHow long have you been in been there, five years or so\n\n<$B> \n\nFour and a half\n\n<$A> \n\nFour and a half and Keith was about the same time\n\n<$B> \n\nI think a bit a bit longer five or   seven  years, \n\n<$A> \n\n Six   \n\n<$B> \n\nThere is a in England there is a time limit for the P H D\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's four years\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n<$B> \n\nIf you 're doing full time four years is the maximum time limit\n\n\nI did it in four and a half because they calculated because I stopped for for a few months\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd if you don't make it for four years\n\n<$B> \n\nYou 're considered <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n<$B> \n\nYou fail yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then uh you don't have an M A there right\n\n<$B> \n\nThere is but, I think it is because of their educational system because their undergraduate is already very geared towards research \n\n\nSo after you finish your undergraduate you can proceed if you have excellent grades you can go straight away to P H D because in P H D in P H D in England we don't have we don't attend any classes we just do research\n\n\nWe   don't have  class\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   uh uhm how nice,   so  \n\n<$B> \n\n Only   it was quite disorienting in the first because I am not very much, because I I was not part of that system so at first I was a bit disoriented\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nBut in the second year I slowly\n\n<$A> \n\nYes, \n\n\nHow was the language, \n\n<$B> \n\nThe language, Yorkshire\n\n\nWell if they speak with a Yorkshire accent you wouldn't know what they 're talking about\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat is it\n\n<$B> \n\nYorkshire accent\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat 's that\n\n\nIs that a native\n\n<$B> \n\nWell it 's not native, it 's , it 's sort of English with a very thick very very strong\n\n\nLet me give you an example uh, \" I thought that was me \"  \n\n<$A> \n\nHoo hoo hoo hoo\n\n<$B> \n\n\" I thought that was me \", \n\n<$A> \n\nWhat time do you have\n\n<$B> \n\nTwelve thirty\n\n<$A> \n\nTwelve thirty\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm going to the

{"text": "<$A> \n\nOkay good afternoon\n\n\nI 'm here with my friend Jun and we 're going to talk about a lot of things especially about Jun whom I will interview a little bit\n\n\nSo hi Jun\n\n<$B> \n\nHello Mimi\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so uh today I really want to know more things about you and I would appreciate it if you can be honest enough to tell me your ideas about some of the things that I 'd like for us to talk about\n\n\nIs that okay\n\n<$B> \n\nSure\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n\nFirst I 'd like for you to give me a brief background about your teaching experience uh your experience as a teacher in La Salle and then a little bit on your teaching experience before you came to La Salle\n\n<$B> \n\nUh can I cite my non-teaching experiences as well\n\n<$A> \n\nYes you may if that 's uh what will make uh an idea or give us an idea of how you came to be who you are   right now  \n\n<$B> \n\n Alright   \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay uhm first of all I I 'm a graduate of A B Mass Communication from F E U in nineteen eighty-seven  okay\n\n\nAnd then I started my I started my career in advertising as a copywriter and account manager\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\nOh and by before I move on uhm what does an account manager do in a    advertising  \n\n<$B> \n\n An account manager   deals with the client clientele of the advertising agency you know we we the creative department collaborates with the management team of the   company  and through the account manager\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nOkay and then after working uh in an advertising company what   did you do  next\n\n<$B> \n\n I moved on   \n\n\nI moved on as an  administrative assistant at  I- \nTemps  \n\n\nIt 's a recruitment agency\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI I got uh  I have experienced had experienced uh dealing with overseas Filipino workers  ,   bound for Saudi Arabia and I conduct training workshop for them which is   I guess  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n On what   topic\n\n<$B> \n\nAbout about procedures policies   dos and don'ts  in uh on when migrating to   Saudi  Arabia\n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd after that I had my first teaching experience at uhm East Asia Computer College\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's in F E U for about uh more than three years\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh three to four years\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then I worked there as a part-timer \n\n\nI was in-charge of the language laboratory   and  while uh while I was pursuing well I was doing my M A at that time I and then I I finished well I finished my M A here in La Salle\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIn M A English Language Education  ,   e  two years ago two or three\n\n\nAnd then I while I was working at East Asia I was also teaching here part-time so I I I taught, uh I taught for about four terms here as a part-timer and then   other institutions educational institutions I have uh worked with uh include AMA AMA Computer College in Caloocan and University of the East Caloocan uh for about two years\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nFor about two years and then I finally settled here in La Salle as a full-timer\n\n\nThis is already my second probationary year\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh so far I 'm enjoying   my stay  here in La Salle\n\n<$A> \n\n Your stay   \n\n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nMy stay in La Salle\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's good\n\n\nBut uh let me ask you a question\n\n\nYou mentioned about starting uhm in an advertising firm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then you moved on to becoming a a a trainor\n\n<$B> \n\nA   trainor yeah  \n\n<$A> \n\n For   a recruitment agency\n\n\nHow come there 's a distinct shift in profession\n\n\nMeaning uhm I can't really see you from an advertising firm to become a trainor in a recruitment agency\n\n\nOh how how did the transition happen\n\n<$B> \n\nWell it is it is by accident I guess  and also because the the the  travel opportunities are there the pay is good so and that 's why I I got attracted with the job\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I I dealt with foreign principals and I guess it 's somehow related   because it  the training involves communication\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nCommunicating dealing with people\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you ever get a chance to uh travel by being a trainor\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I I was sent to Cagayan Cagayan de Oro that 's in in uh\n\n<$A> \n\nDown south\n\n<$B> \n\nDown south yes uh\n\n<$A> \n\nCagayan de Oro  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah   down  south\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n   Oo   in Mindanao\n\n<$B> \n\n And in   \n\n\n   yes and also during my stay in advertising agency I was also sent uh\n\n<$A> \n\nAbroad\n\n<$B> \n\nNo  uh northern Mindanao northern Mindanao\n\n\nSo  there are travel  there were travel opportunities  and besides I I I have no regrets having an industry experience because I can somehow uh relate what my experience to the experiences in the in the academe\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm but let me ask you which is more enjoyable for you   the  experiences you had outside of the academe or the experiences that you have now that you 're sort of full-time in school\n\n<$B> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\nWell my experience as a teacher is fulfilling is very although very demanding\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh the job entails tedious paperwork but uh so far I 'm not complaining\n\n\nI 'm enjoying every minute of my teaching profession\n\n<$A> \n\nYes you said enjoying but uhm which part of teaching do you enjoy the most\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I enjoy dealing with  uh students like uh molding their minds or helping them become a better person\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat about the power of being able to control the class don't   you enjoy that  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yes that 's also   another challenge that 's part of the challenge challenge which I enjoy most   the  ability to persuade the ability to manipulate    or to  let other people do what I want them to because I want them to because I care for them \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n\nOkay another question would be now that you 're uh La Salle is a research institution\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd uh they 've been uh encouraging us to do research work \n\n In what particular field are you most interested in and uh why\n\n \n\n<$B> \n\n I am   \n\n\nI am interested in psycholinguistics\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's uh presently I 'm doing uh my dissertation uh uhm on on the cognitive how how mind works uh in terms of the, analyzing the ability of the students to detect grammatical error   and then  to explain \n\n That 's uh or or this is the so-called metalinguistics or\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nSo are you saying that this is some sort of an experimental research wherein you will use your classes to be the subjects of your thesis and where your own students will be the ones to determine if they recognize their errors and if they are able to correct their errors\n\n<$B> \n\nYes uh my target subjects or respondents would be my students and of course I 'm also planning to uh to try to have other students other than Lasallian students\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay \n\n\nSo when are you planning to start this are you already doing it\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm at the proposal stage\n\n\nI I hope I 'll be able to present it at the end of the term if not then maybe second term\n\n<$A> \n\nJust uh as a matter of curiosity uh isn't pilot testing part of the proposal making or proposal uh you know uh when you 're conceptualizing the proposal isn't piloting it uh going to help you refine your proposal   before  you actually implement it \n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nNo uh because of time constraints I I don't think I can pilot test my questionnaire anymore but what is more important is the refinement or refinement of the paper uh uh relating the concepts together to to make it coherent\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I can probably do the testing proper after I have presented my proposal\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so as a teacher you don't only teach  'no  but you also have some form of social life\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat do you do in your spare time when you 're not in La Salle\n\n\nWhat are your preoccupations\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I I am still active with our parish-based choir and I I used to be active with the church with our Parish Commentators and Lectors Guild\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I am a trainor at our parish-based cooperative\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay uh other than that are there

too negative on the Filipinos that uh Singaporeans are good at\n\n<$B> \n\nWell\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen you compare that when you say that we 're lagging behind that we should improve specifically on which

\n\nNone\n\n<$A> \n\nGood for him\n\n<$B> \n\nGood thing they are not uhm asking us to to substitute for them anymore   because last time  \n\n<$C> \n\n Imagine you would   travel from here to\n\n<$B> \n\nNot to the main building  ,  that 's so far \n\n\nReally\n\n\nYeah\n\n\nThat was the what do you call that the procedure before\n\n<$C> \n\n To the new kingdom   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBut now it changed\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nGood thing\n\n<$C> \n\nBy the subject\n\n<$A> \n\nBy the subject and by the level\n\n<$C> \n\nI think no\n\n\nUh if there will be nobody who 's going to substitute from the subject areas that 's the time they get from the level other levels\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's a form it 's a different procedure here right\n\n\nWe get substitute teachers by the level not   by the subject  area\n\n<$C> \n\n Uh by the level   \n\n<$A> \n\nLike if there 's an absentee from the senior prep you cannot, right prep\n\n\nActually junior prep because they don't have classes in the morning\n\n\nIn the afternoon when we have absentees or absent teachers the senior prep substitutes for them\n\n<$C> \n\nUh so only the prep substituting for the prep\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah prep for prep and then grade one two and three I think\n\n<$C> \n\nSo you have the same subjects anyway\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah because it 's self-contained\n\n<$C> \n\nSame thing with grade one\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm grade one is also self-   contained  but grade two and grade three they are semi-departmental right\n\n<$B> \n\n Grade one   \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$C> \n\nSo they substitute by the level by the subject\n\n<$A> \n\nI think by the  \n\n<$B> \n\nBy the level\n\n<$C> \n\nJust the same thing\n\n<$A> \n\nThere\n\n<$C> \n\nSo how about your LET\n\n<$A> \n\nOh    don't remind  me\n\n<$C> \n\n It 's coming by   \n\n\n  It 's coming by  this August\n\n<$A> \n\n This uhm   this August twenty-seven\n\n<$C> \n\nSunday\n\n<$A> \n\nYes whole day because I got secondary could you believe that\n\n\nI 'm in prep and they gave me secondary\n\n<$C> \n\nBut your training is in high school\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n\nI graduated B S Biology\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo that 's why\n\n<$B> \n\nGood thing it 's only for it will only last for the whole day because last time  ,  when we took the test \n\n<$C> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nTwo days\n\n<$B> \n\nRight yeah we took it for about two days\n\n<$A> \n\nTwo days\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOne whole day for all the general education thing and then the second day which is half day\n\n<$C> \n\nFor specialization\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah for our   specialization  \n\n<$C> \n\n Specialization   \n\n<$A> \n\nSo you mean\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's two years ago\n\n<$A> \n\nYou mean for the general you have one day and then another half-day for the major\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah your   major subjects  \n\n<$C> \n\n Major subjects   \n\n<$A> \n\nOh my goodness\n\n<$C> \n\nBut it 's different in the elementary\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$C> \n\nWe only have one day\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm even today\n\n\nUh no half-day\n\n<$C> \n\nUh for the   elementary  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nFor the elementary they have half-day\n\n\nSecondary we have a whole day  ,    to do the test  \n\n\nI think it 's draining\n\n\nIs it draining\n\n<$C> \n\n So it 's the same thing   \n\n\nTraining for\n\n<$A> \n\nDraining for us\n\n<$C> \n\nUh okay\n\n<$A> \n\n'Cause we have to do the test for the whole day\n\n\nWhat do you think\n\n<$C> \n\n  Maybe a bit  \n\n<$B> \n\n You can manage   \n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's what you 're here   for   \n\n<$C> \n\n With Grace   \n\n<$A> \n\nNo  \n\n<$C> \n\nWith Grace I doubt\n\n<$A> \n\nOh my goodness\n\n\nIt 's   quite scary  \n\n<$C> \n\n But don't worry   you 're going to pass\n\n<$A> \n\nI hope so\n\n\nWe 're praying

something, Civil Service Commission\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$C> \n\nNot P not uh P R C yet\n\n\nThat time I went to Batasan\n\n<$A> \n\nBatasan in\n\n<$C> \n\nIn Quezon   City  \n\n<$A> \n\n Quezon   City\n\n\nSo far  \n\n<$C> \n\nThat 's where I got my uh results\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's where you got your results too\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nThey didn't mail you\n\n<$C> \n\nThey did but they only gave me the a notice of passing   not the real thing  \n\n<$A> \n\n Without the percentage   \n\n\nSo you want to see the percentage\n\n<$C> \n\nOf course\n\n<$A> \n\n So how did you   fare  \n\n<$C> \n\n The yellow   the yellow card\n\n<$A> \n\nHow did you fare\n\n<$C> \n\nDon't ask  \n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n\nI bet you got high\n\n<$C> \n\nUh nah   just average  \n\n<$A> \n\n Maybe you 're even   the topnotcher  \n\n<$C> \n\nHow I wish\n\n<$A> \n\nYee\n\n\n  You even made a  courtesy call in Metro Bank  \n\n<$C> \n\n It 's not possible   \n\n<$A> \n\nI bet you received fifty thousand pesos  \n\n<$C> \n\nIf only those things are true I would probably uh buy you what hamburger  \n\n<$A> \n\n Ay  so cheap\n\n<$C> \n\nPlus coke\n\n<$A> \n\nUh hamburger plus coke\n\n<$C> \n\nPlus uh\n\n<$A> \n\nAdd French fries and I 'll be happy\n\n<$C> \n\nFries what fries the curly\n\n<$A> \n\nNo the regular ones\n\n<$C> \n\nThe regular ones, \n\n\nWhat else\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat else\n\n\nWell right now\n\n<$C> \n\nAre you going there by\n\n<$A> \n\nCarpool\n\n<$C> \n\nUh okay\n\n<$A> \n\nWe 'll be going there by carpool\n\n<$C> \n\nWith the others\n\n<$A> \n\nYes with   Anne and Chloe  \n\n<$C> \n\n How many of you are taking the tests   \n\n<$A> \n\nAt P U P we 'll be three   Anne  Chloe and I\n\n<$C> \n\n Chloe   \n\n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then in Lyceum there 'll be   I think  four no three Ruby uhm B J   and Olive  \n\n<$C> \n\n Uh Lyceum   \n\n\n Ruby will   still take the test\n\n\n  I thought she had  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   Secondary English\n\n<$C> \n\nNo I thought she had already taken one last year\n\n<$A> \n\nNo she didn't\n\n<$C> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause she already uh no she didn't have the education units then so that 's why\n\n<$C> \n\nUh that 's uh okay\n\n\nSo she has to complete first the   eighteen units  \n\n<$A> \n\n Eighteen units   of education which we finished last summer actually\n\n<$C> \n\nFor the T C P\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah T C P\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd you 're done with your T C P\n\n<$A> \n\nAlmost because we specialized\n\n<$C> \n\nWhat do you mean\n\n<$A> \n\nWe took uhm six units for the major because it 's Teacher 's Certificate Program right\n\n\nAnd then you can get six more units so that you 'll have specialization like we got six units of Early Childhood\n\n<$C> \n\nUh that 's why you 're taking Early Childhood with Ruby also\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n\nWe 'll finish this term\n\n<$C> \n\nSo how many units have you earned already\n\n\nEighteen plus six\n\n<$A> \n\nActually we got nineteen because of PROFE one unit\n\n\nPROFE 's just one unit\n\n<$C> \n\nWhat 's that\n\n<$A> \n\nUh Professional Ethics\n\n<$C> \n\nIn Education\n\n<$A> \n\nYes and then nineteen plus six so that 's twenty-five\n\n<$C> \n\nUh okay, twenty-five units for the T C P\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah T C P with special   training in Early Childhood  \n\n<$C> \n\n That 's before you take   the uh board exams\n\n<$A> \n\nBefore uhm before we take the board exam you have to get eighteen units right\n\n<$C> \n\nBut that 's more than eighteen units already\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah that 's more than eighteen units already but we opted to take specialization so that it will jive with our present job\n\n<$C> \n\nBut if you have only eighteen units\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's okay\n\n<$C> \n\nIt 's okay\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's fine\n\n\nAs long as you get the requirements\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nWe have these requirements in the P R C so\n\n<$C> \n\nFor Secondary Education\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no for licensure\n\n<$C> \n\nUh okay, for the exams\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah for the exams, \n\n\nThat 's it\n\n<$C> \n\nI hope you 're going to uh, to bring the bacon  \n\n<$A> \n\nNo that 's pressure already\n\n\nYou know what\n\n\nDid you, have packed lunch during that time\n\n<$C> \n\nUh, what, I didn't have\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$C> \n\nBut we were asked to buy because there was a canteen anyway in the school\n\n<$A> \n\nUh   is  it open\n\n<$C> \n\n So   \n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's Sunday, \n\n<$C> \n\nThere was one in our school uh in the in that was I forgot the name of the school but it 's in Quezon City also\n\n\nSo we were allowed to take the lunch outside\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$C> \n\nThen uh we were asked to come back one o'clock I guess or one thirty\n\n<$A> \n\nFor the test\n\n<$C> \n\nFor the remaining tests\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm I think we 'll not be allowed to go outside\n\n<$C> \n\nJust bring your own  baon  so, it will not be a big problem\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know I don't think I 'll be able to eat anyway\n\n<$C> \n\nAnyway you 'll have what uh eight o'clock\n\n\nYou 'll be starting at eight o'clock\n\n<$A> \n\nNo we have to be there before six thirty\n\n<$C> \n\nUh it 's too early\n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe it 's seven o'clock\n\n<$C> \n\nSeven\n\n<$A> \n\nI think it will start at seven o'clock and\n\n<$C> \n\nThe test itself\n\n<$A> \n\nIt will end about four, maybe or three\n\n<$C> \n\nUh okay\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know yet because I didn't have the notice\n\n<$C> \n\nSo you will have uhm seven to maybe eleven thirty\n\n<$A> \n\nI think so and then twelve\n\n<$C> \n\nTo\n\n<$A> \n\nI think one to three or one to four\n\n\nIt depends   I think it depends on the proctor  \n\n<$C> \n\n Just bring your packed lunch  , and  merienda  maybe\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh candies\n\n<$C> \n\nI can't remember we were given time to have  merienda  that time\n\n\nWhat I remember is we only had lunch\n\n<$A> \n\nI think you can take\n\n<$C> \n\nI think yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nYou can take  merienda  during the test\n\n<$B> \n\nBut since you 're so nervous\n\n<$A> \n\nEngrossed\n\n<$B> \n\nOr engrossed with the test you won't have the appetite to eat\n\n<$C> \n\nIn my case I didn't remember any  merienda  I just remember the lunch\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$C> \n\nThat was nineteen  kopong-kopong   \n\n<$A> \n\nIn my case I can't take drinks during the exam because by that time I will go outside to go to the comfort room\n\n<$C> \n\nNo don't take it so seriously\n\n\nAnyway you know yourself if uh you 'll be able to make it or what\n\n\nAnd with the kind of review you 're doing my goodness\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause we 're

Art\n\n<$B> \n\nUh okay uh well I think uh basically uh, I wanted I was uh in the charismatic uh renewal and I uh wanted to search for something deeper as far as my prayer life is concerned\n\n\nSo uh one day I was in Mass in Magallanes and I saw an ad on a Christian Meditation Retreat which uh uh made caught my interest and I decided to sign up for that retreat\n\n\nAnd uh in that retreat uh Fr Lawrence Freeman was the one who  who started to teach uh uh and share meditation\n\n\nAnd it intrigued me and as far as ah I was concerned I wanted to see what it would do to me in my life  'no  \n\n\nSo I decided to practice that way of praying meditation\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen was this   nineteen  \n\n<$B> \n\n This is   in nineteen ninety nineteen ninety eighty-nine or ninety and then uh I decided to tell myself uh I 'll do it for two months religiously as taught to me and see what it will do to me if it changes if I see a lot of changes in me then I 'd  I would continue to practice it\n\n\nSo after two months I realized that it was really giving me a lot of insights and a lot of uh depth as far as life was concerned\n\n\nI started to see the other side of the coin so to say so to  \n\n\nSo uh, I decided to continue the practice until today\n\n\nUh I 'm still practicing it for the last ten ten years  'no  and uh I still try to do it uh religiously twice a day\n\n\nSo I and I don't think I intend to stop because I see that it has really given me uh a lot of peace a lot of tranquility a lot of security uh uh and it has brought me closer I think to God and uh I 've come to know God uh the many aspects of God uh in this life\n\n\nSo uh I think it 's something that I will not give up and I consider it as my prayer time every time I meditate\n\n\nI took aside this time and say this is God 's time so I devote twenty to thirty minutes in the morning and twenty to thirty minutes in the evening for this   so  \n\n<$A> \n\n That is   daily practice\n\n<$B> \n\nThat is my daily practice\n\n<$C> \n\nBut uh on the first time that you did the meditation did you have a guide or did you read books\n\n\nHow were you able to sustain two months of uh meditating on your own\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nUh did you go to Fr Lawrence or you mean just by this one talk you were inspired to do this all alone\n\n\nYou did not have community you did not have books\n\n<$B> \n\nNo uh nothing\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIt uh there was no organization yet at that time\n\n\nThere was no structure that was the first time Fr Lawrence gave a retreat here\n\n\nIt was a one day actually it was a one day not retreat but a one day recollection on Christian meditation and uh I just told myself I 'll really do it for two months\n\n\nAnd then uh later on I his books came along and I decided to buy some of his books and that 's what uh kept me in the journey\n\n\nAnd after two months or three months I decided that uh I think there should be a group really that should start to share this and I realized that uh uh maybe about four months later someone called me and told me that they already have a group that had started in Don Bosco\n\n\nSo I decided to go there to Don Bosco and then as I started to sit and meditate in this group I also started to go out and try to share it with others\n\n\nSo then other groups started to come along the way\n\n\nAnd that 's when Christian meditation really started\n\n<$A> \n\nUh  how about our group what did you, when  when was the group formed\n\n<$B> \n\nWell of course this is where we live  'no  and uh so with uh it was one of the earliest groups also formed\n\n\nI decided to take along all my friends around me uh and share it with them\n\n\nSo this I think this group also started the same time in nineteen ninety\n\n<$C> \n\nIn my recollection  it first started with uhm Art 's trying uhm making an appointment in uh the parish in Merville Parish\n\n\nUhm he asked the the parish priest then to if he could give a talk and after the Mass after the six P M Mass and so after the six P M Mass he gave a talk and then we started putting out poster one or two at the church door and uh we or he was able to find the venue that was the   Knights of Columbus  \n\n<$B> \n\n Knights of Columbus   \n\n\nYeah Knights of Columbus\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd there were people and he we started uh just being there and then there were people who read the the poster or who would uhm or who heard his speech his his talk and they would uh go to this session and uh because it was happening weekly uhm shortly after we we started to experience a bonding uh among us\n\n\nSo we extended it a little bit more to cover uh Bible sharing\n\n\nSo originally it started as a pure uh talk on meditation and experience of meditation and then later on as as the participants uh\n\n<$D> \n\nGrew\n\n<$C> \n\nUh stayed on longer they they had a hunger for the Word\n\n\nAnd uhm so there was a suggestion that uh we read the the gospel and  and share\n\n<$A> \n\nBut then you were already  Kuya  Manny you were you were already complete you were there, \n\n<$D> \n\nWell uh, in my case uh\n\n<$B> \n\nActually uh excuse me actually even before it started in Knights of Columbus we already started here in South   Admiral  \n\n<$D> \n\n South Admiral   yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nIn the chapel and uh of course uh Manny being one of my best friends I asked him to join us in the South Admiral Chapel, okay\n\n\nAnd then it grew after maybe a month in South Admiral Chapel we moved to Knights of Columbus\n\n<$D> \n\nThe group uh grew bigger as Dinggay was saying\n\n\nSome people saw it through the posters and uh some people were invited uh as the group became bigger\n\n\nAnd then you know that was the time that we incorporated through a suggestion of a couple that we incorporated the Bible sharing so that uh there 's also more bonding and more activity in that sense\n\n<$A> \n\nYou were all charismatics then\n\n<$D> \n\nI was not\n\n<$A> \n\nOnly  Kuya  Art\n\n<$B> \n\nMe and Dinggay  oo  \n\n<$D> \n\nWell I 've always been you know I was not charismatic but I 've always been uh uh how do you say that a searcher you know uh I think ever since I was born I have been searching you know\n\n\nUh even before the formal practice of Christian meditation which I am doing now uh I started reading books on uh self knowledge uh self-realization\n\n\nI went into the Hindu scriptures\n\n\nI read uh  Bhagavad Gita  and uh uhm another one I forgot  'no  \n\n\nAnd I worked I dabbled into uh Buddhist scriptures also and some theosophical books and I sort of toyed around with uh different forms of meditation\n\n\nIt was just that you know I could not sustain it because I was all alone and I was doing different forms\n\n\nUntil you know uh I got to join this group also and then there was a sort of formal way or technique of doing it and uh there was this uh group that met once a week so it that 's helped sustain me you know until now\n\n\nI still sit quite regularly\n\n\nUh that 's about it\n\n<$A> \n\nTwice a day also\n\n<$D> \n\nUh twice a day\n\n\nSometimes well sometimes it 's once a day but I do do a lot of quiet you know\n\n\nUhm for me meditation is not just simply just sitting  'no  \n\n\nUh meditation is I think a way of life\n\n\nIn that sense  'no  uh it 's being aware of what I am doing\n\n\nIf I am eating I am just eating  'no  \n\n\nTotally there  'no  \n\n\nIf I am playing billiards I 'm just playing billiards  'no  \n\n\nUh nothing outside that\n\n\nSo that for me is also a part of of the whole process of integration\n\n\nThat 's about it as far as I 'm concerned,  \n\n<$B> \n\nHow about you\n\n<$C> \n\nUh  on how I discovered meditation\n\n\nUhm I was a regular uh Blessed Sacrament worshipper and uh I was a charismatic\n\n\nAnd also uh in the beginning uh Centering Prayer was uhm taught to the community of  Buklod ng Pag-ibig  where I  the community where I belonged\n\n\nAnd I tried to do centering uh but it was a one day seminar one day teaching and then it was not followed up by the community\n\n\nUhm so I could not sustain it\n\n\nSo I stayed in the Blessed Sacrament that that was my quieting\n\n\nWhen I saw Art there whom I did not know at that time uh  'no  \n\n\nFinally I got to know him uhm and I I wondered how this man could uh keep so still and  I asked him about it and he and he taught me the the technique  \n\n\nAnd from there on uhm I started meditating\n\n\nUhm then he started he put up this group which uh which sustained me and others because of the regular teaching and then there were there were Fr Lawrence would come often so there was constant nourishment uhm, \n\n In the beginning I I was so hungry for silence in my life uhm although I had hours and hours of it in the Blessed Sacrament but for some reason this this type of quieting was, was deeper\n\n\nI I  I can't explain it but then it 's a hunger of the soul  e  and and uh I I do I do meditation five six times a day and, and uhm I 've stayed on\n\n\nI I do it twice a day and I 've seen a lot of uhm changes in myself like I used to be a very nervous person I 'm very anxious and uhm trying to please everybody all the time\n\n\nWhen the group knew me they knew they they knew me on that level \n\n But because I believe I 've been faithful to the to the sittings I 've been able to detach from the opinions of others and I 've been able to discover myself uh love myself understand myself\n\n\nI I was able to uhm unmask many of my masks unravel uh and and then I started to understand how truly God must have loved me\n\n\nAnd because of that I, because of that I love myself more and when I love myself more I, I uhm when I love myself more I just became a better person\n\n<$B> \n\nBasically I think the reason why people who really practice it stay on to it is because uh you see that uh it really expands us\n\n<$D> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIt   widens  our level of understanding\n\n<$D> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\nIt uh makes us uh the opposite of being narrow-minded you know\n\n\nOh uh we can be so focused and be one track mind but not closed to others\n\n\nIn other words it has led us to understand the journey better especially the spiritual journey\n\n\nAnd understanding the spiritual journey I I feel that uh following the context of the Bible where Jesus said uh  where the Spirit is there 's freedom and liberty  it frees uh it has freed me from a lot of perceptions and concepts which I feel has restricted my growth in life\n\n\nAnd through the practice of meditation uh this way of praying it has led me to understand that, there there we can widen our horizon we can widen our understanding call it maybe wisdom uh and this widening happens without studying\n\n\nIt 's an internal knowledge that comes about through the practice of meditation\n\n\nUh you don't need to read a lot of theories uh and study in order to understand the insights the depth uh the call it maybe the revelations or uh what term do we use uh when\n\n<$A> \n\nIntuitions", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

just realized later on that it is all\nabout a woman  \n\n\nSo which is which\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause I was thinking since he portrayed the woman as an\nobject which is something like sex object object of his desire\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWould that count as pornographic when you trivialize women\n\n<$C> \n\nWas he\n\n<$B> \n\nExample only\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uh\n\n<$B> \n\nTreating her as an object

about Neil and the words he said about he lashed out about my character, \n\n\nAnd I lost my patience\n\n\nI asked him to talk to talk about the behavior of his brother, well that 's all\n\n<$B>

crush on me\n\n<$B> \n\nHe 's just a boy\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah he 's just a kid\n\n\nHe 's only eleven years old\n\n\nAnd then hearing those words gosh it really made me feel so miserable\n\n\nCome on let

</unclear> getting serious\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nWhat do you think\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nJust an advice don't get so serious about her, because, that will lead to nowhere\n\n\n  You

what Arlene it is fun to to have a fling like that\n\n\nI  I can call it a fling because it is a fling right\n\n\nBut don't get too serious with with such a kind of relationship because it 's not

to\n\n<$A> \n\nTo hope about what\n\n<$B> \n\nTo hope  that things will be the same\n\n\nIt 'll still be the same but I know\n\n<$A> \n\nIf Amy will come to your place, you are going to introduce her to your high school friends right\n\n<$B> \n\nYes, \n\n<$A> \n\n  Uhm  \n\n<$B> \n\n What   am I going to tell them\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nNothing\n\n<$A> \n\nThat you 're  just friends, and that, \n\n<$B> \n\nI am not   even sure  \n\n<$A> \n\n Will they   accept will they accept Amy, I mean the company\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course they will, they must I mean  \n\n<$A> \n\nIt is a must for them to accept Amy\n\n<$B> \n\nShe 's my friend\n\n<$A> \n\nShe is your friend they know\n\n<$B> \n\nI am their friend\n\n<$A> \n\nBut don't give me that bullshit that she 's just a friend\n\n<$B> \n\nOhhhppp, bullshit\n\n<$A> \n\nI said don't give me that bullshit\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's <unclear> 1 word </unclear> to say\n\n<$A> \n\nNo it 's just, it is just an expression of mine though I know it 's not right\n\n\nSo it is not proper for me\n\n\nEver since we transfer here in Metrica I 've learned to mention so many foul words\n\n\nI 've learned to use those foul words because of all my hang-ups, so you better, better ignore all those words and you better get used to it\n\n<$B> \n\nI am used to it\n\n<$A> \n\nYou 're used to it\n\n<$B> \n\nWith all my friends in school\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nI know you 're in a Catholic School as well\n\n<$B> \n\nWell\n\n<$A> \n\n  Now   \n\n<$B> \n\n Well   \n\n<$A> \n\nNow what will you do this sem break\n\n<$B> \n\nThis sem break, uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n\nWill you go swimming together with Amy and together with, with Engel\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nWill you stay at the will you stay at the resort or will will you stay at the beach house of your friend\n\n<$B> \n\nI want to ask you something\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat\n\n<$B> \n\nAre you happy with your life now\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'm not happy with my life, \n\n\nYes I can say that I am contented with my life but I 'm not that happy with my life\n\n\nYou know what I mean, \n\n\nThere 's still an emptiness within me which I cannot see what it is\n\n\n<unclear> words </unclear> I 'm still searching, \n\n<$B> \n\nBut in your condition of course you know what you want\n\n<$A> \n\nAs of now I 'm not so sure I 'm not so sure of the future\n\n\nI 'm not so sure of my plans, especially especially of all those things that happened with me these past few months\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know I envy those people especially my classmates who already have plans after they graduate from college\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat are their plans\n\n\nWhat are their plans\n\n<$B> \n\nAs usual, go into mass media\n\n<$A> \n\nBut isn't it such a bore to, to plan your life ahead\n\n\nAnyway it is good to have definite plans but, that will be so dull\n\n\nIf you simply, if you simply  follow the pattern of your life, of your life that you want it to be   then you won't have to  \n\n<$B> \n\n It is much more   thrilling\n\n\nBut then you went you won't have to get to be worried,   for the  \n\n<$A> \n\n Worried about what   \n\n\nAbout the future\n\n<$B> \n\nYes, if you plan ahead\n\n<$A> \n\nFor me it is quite a bore\n\n\nI don't know\n\n\nIt 's just that, I take life as as it is you know although I have plans for the future it 's just that I don't want those plans to run my my present life because it will ruin me", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "116dbb16-b633-4f3b-9011-074f66eb6263", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:58.987469+00:00"}

I 've seen\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nYou were with me when we watched the Green Mile right\n\n<$B> \n\n I I don't think so\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Green Mile Tom Hanks\n\n\nWe were with Sir Bruce and Lavoxa\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay I was with you   and the guys  \n\n<$A> \n\n You were with us   \n\n<$B> \n\n  Yeah  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nIt was well for me a very touching movie uh Gotesco One so I liked very much\n\n\nHow about you \n\n<$B> \n\nGreen Mile was kinda cheesy\n\n<$A> \n\nCheesy\n\n<$B> \n\nSince uh it was wrote by Stephen King a horror   a horror  writer\n\n\nBut I never, not that

\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then being murdered later on and raped\n\n<$A> \n\nIt was gross\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nI never liked that\n\n\nYou were the one who asked me to watch that\n\n<$B> \n\nIt was a nice movie\n\n\nHillary Swank won an Oscar for that\n\n<$A> \n\nBut he was I mean she was   raped  \n\n<$B> \n\n She   she was raped\n\n\nIt was a real life story\n\n<$A> \n\nIt was a kind of a real  \n\n\nAre you <unclear> 1 word </unclear> at me whatever\n\n\nAnyway\n\n<$B> \n\nShe was raped from behind so what\n\n<$A> \n\n So what \n\n \n\n<$B> \n\nM I Two was great uh technically wise\n\n<$A> \n\nWe were not together when we watched that one\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but we were in the same cinema\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nI think you were with\n\n<$A> \n\nFr Glen\n\n<$B> \n\nFr Glen\n\n\nI was with Rey and Mike\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause you asked me not to watch it with you\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause you will you will be late\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh and\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd you told us that you would be late so, we we moved on we watched the movie by ourselves not waiting for you because you would belate\n\n<$A> \n\n E  but but the thing is you never waited for me\n\n<$B> \n\nI always do\n\n<$A> \n\nI made    tampo   that like that uh   at that  moment uh\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n Then   \n\n\n Ang baduy mo  \n\n<$A> \n\nThank you\n\n\nBecause the thing is uhm the reason why you watched that movie earlier than I did was uhm perhaps because everyone would be late also so it would be   perhaps  \n\n<$B> \n\n The reason   why we met was because of the Bingo by the Jaycees\n\n<$A> \n\nWhich was not   continued  that day\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nYeah it was postponed for two weeks   then  \n\n<$A> \n\n And you were   not there during the Bingo\n\n<$B> \n\nI was sick\n\n\nCould you blame me\n\n<$A> \n\nYou were not sick then\n\n<$B> \n\nI was sick since uh Thursday\n\n<$A> \n\nYou were not talking to me\n\n<$B> \n\nYou were not talking to me\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm you were not talking to me\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause we were waiting for you that Thursday night\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen\n\n<$B> \n\nAt the North Lounge\n\n\nWe always do\n\n\nWe waited for your last exam\n\n<$A> \n\nUh during that time\n\n<$B> \n\nBut then you never showed up\n\n\nWe left then we saw you\n\n<$A> \n\nWell my mind was not actually clear at that part\n\n<$B> \n\nWe saw you with who 's that Christopher and Bhang\n\n<$A> \n\nWe were settling a case I guess\n\n\nOh that time, uh oh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I was sick   waiting for you  \n\n<$A> \n\n 'Cause we were   'cause we were not talking then\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy\n\n<$A> \n\nCan you imagine we 're talking about this on tape now  \n\n<$B> \n\nWe 're talking about not talking\n\n<$A> \n\nAnyway\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause Monday uh we worked at J V in the morning then Tuesday I was out\n\n<$A> \n\nYou said J V right\n\n<$B> \n\nG V\n\n<$A> \n\nYou said J V  \n\n<$B> \n\nG V\n\n<$A> \n\nYou   said J V  \n\n<$B> \n\n J V F M    \n\n<$A> \n\n Uy  one day Sonia went to the station\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd   brought you   bibingka  \n\n<$A> \n\n She was   \n\n\nNo no it was not Sonia\n\n\nUh the one who brought the  bibingka  was a couple and they sort of just brought the  bibingka  because they said they were listening to our show\n\n\nAnd Sonia came there because she 's organizing this uhm club which you know we 'd like to call Friendship Club\n\n<$B> \n\nKiko and Friends\n\n<$A> \n\nIf if ever we would have to be to to uhm name that organization what do you think would be the best\n\n<$B> \n\nI can't think of anything right now\n\n\nIt 's a public service program\n\n<$A> \n\nI was I was thinking that it should not be only focused on our show but on others as well   because  \n\n<$B> \n\n As   G V per se\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Great  Goers  \n\n<$A> \n\nThe best\n\n\n Uy  one time  uhm after our class in La Salle when a classmate approached me and told me that there 's this D J who said on air that I was not texting him anymore it 's like as if he 's asking to text him again\n\n\nAnd he said his his duty is during the night time\n\n\nSo I guess it 's if I 'm not mistaken\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's Dean\n\n<$A> \n\nDean\n\n<$B> \n\nDennis \n\n<$A> \n\nDennis \n\n\nYou never went to Maverick 's birthday\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause I was sick Saturday\n\n<$A> \n\nYou never returned the tape\n\n<$B> \n\nI haven't returned the tape\n\n\nI  I still have the tape at home\n\n<$A> \n\nYou 've got to return it to your friend\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course I 'm gonna return the tape\n\n\nIt 's not mine\n\n<$A> \n\n After  \n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's even recorded for him not by him\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n\n Ha , dead air dead air  \n\n<$B> \n\nI know, \n\n\nI haven't had lunch\n\n<$A> \n\nLikewise  \n\n\n  Are you saying   \n\n<$B> \n\n Hungry   \n\n Saying what\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSaying what\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat time would you be coming again to class\n\n<$B> \n\nTwo  two o'clock\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nFor my theology class\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you have built your name in theology\n\n<$B> \n\nYes everybody knows that I don't believe in God\n\n<$A> \n\n why is that\n\n\nYou know when we had Rizal it was like Sir Pieto told us that there 's nothing wrong with believing\n\n\nIt 's like when you believe now and you die later and then you realize there is no God then there 's nothing to regret about because you are already dead\n\n\nBut if you die and you realize there 's really a God\n\n<$B> \n\nHow could you regret\n\n\nYou 're dead\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah that 's why so I\n\n<$B> \n\nSo\n\n<$A> \n\nThe point is there 's nothing wrong with believing\n\n<$B> \n\nI think uh believing is just having uh a hope that okay I 'm gonna die I 'll meet this person who who guided me all my life\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd doesn't it give you anything like a spark in your life\n\n\n  A hope  \n\n<$B> \n\n You could   be a spark in my life  \n\n\nYou could be my hope\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I   see  \n\n<$B> \n\n See   I don't have to  to have faith on this someone I do not know 'cause I have faith on myself\n\n\nI have faith on my friends\n\n<$A> \n\nBut the thing is don't you think it 's uhm sort of natural for somebody to hold something above him\n\n\nUhm like someone who would not put him down\n\n\nIt 's like I know you can believe on me and count on me but then I also have these times when I go up and then I go down and well I it 's not that I want to put you down but there might be a time that I may be putting you down just like the time that we were not talking to each other\n\n<$B> \n\nSo\n\n<$A> \n\nSo the thing is isn't He sort of somebody who you 'd place above you and like He 'd not put you down\n\n<$B> \n\nUh that is making a false hope of yourself\n\n\nI mean if you put me down it 's just a a mere fact because you 're a human\n\n\nSo not that you 're supposed to make mistakes it 's just that you can't avoid mistakes\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nGranting that putting me down is a mistake\n\n<$A> \n\nUh no okay, \n\n\nDoes it give you some sort of hopeless attitude\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy\n\n<$A> \n\nNothing, it 's just\n\n<$B> \n\nYou 're hopeless not me\n\n<$A> \n\n This conversation really <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nAnd what else\n\n<$B> \n\nUh you know back in U P, I had this uh classmate\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh his uh point of view or argument is that God is only an excuse that if I ask you why does it rain\n\n<$A> \n\n  Precisely  \n\n<$B> \n\n Because you   can't answer you would say \" God \" \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that 's an excuse not that God created the rain\n\n\n  It 's just  that you don't know the answer so you say it 's God\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nI guess that 's the precise point  \n\n<$B> \n\nThat\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nI guess it 's for me it fits me\n\n\nThat whenever I do not understand a thing especially  it 's not with regards to things that you could study   about  but it 's with things that you have to believe in without looking \n\n I always say it 's because of Him because my mind is that limited\n\n<$B> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\nHow could you   always  say that uh it maybe it 's just meant to be that way but not really make an excuse\n\n\nI mean if there 's a God how would you feel that He 's just an excuse \n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n\nI just hope that everybody else can understand you as much as the

first kiss and all\n\n\nThey start really young\n\n\nI mean during our time it was like Maricel Soriano Dina Bonnevie but they were past   thirteen  fourteen \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n You know    ,  \n\n\nYou know how I 'll compare this\n\n\nI 'll compare this to cellular phones\n\n\nKids now at a young age they get cellular phones\n\n\nWho who give them their phone\n\n<$B> \n\n And now   \n\n\nTheir parents\n\n<$A> \n\nTheir parents so who, like initiate it or encourage them\n\n<$B> \n\nI can't blame their parents\n\n<$A> \n\nWho encourage them to go into uh pre-marital sex\n\n<$B> \n\nWell majority would still be their friends but it 's all the influence of the media\n\n\nI can't say parents condone it\n\n<$A> \n\nOf course parents will condone it\n\n<$B> \n\nWill not, condone it\n\n<$A> \n\nWill not\n\n<$B> \n\nWill not\n\n\nWhy will they condone pre-marital sex\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah you 're right\n\n\nI misunderstood you\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat do you mean\n\n<$A> \n\nNothing\n\n\nAnyway so  uh, so what why do kids go into it\n\n\nJust for the fun of it\n\n\nUh they wanna explore they wanna experiment\n\n<$B> \n\nDriven by   curiosity  \n\n<$A> \n\n Or   is it really the libido that 's acting up or\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know I never had it when I was their age\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah but let 's try to look into\n\n<$B> \n\nI really think it 's the media\n\n\nUh I think it 's the environment 'cause when we were when we were in our teenage years we didn't have this kind\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah that 's true\n\n\nHow old are you anyway\n\n<$B> \n\nTwenty-nine\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's kinda old\n\n\nI 'm only twenty-five\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah right\n\n<$A> \n\nNah I 'm twenty-seven so basically we come from the   same generation  \n\n<$B> \n\n Same generation   \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I agree with you but, if we become parents hopefully we 'll we will be\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I think we will be 'cause I 'm gonna marry you in two years right\n\n<$B> \n\nCan't we make that earlier\n\n<$A> \n\nUh that 's a different topic\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so  if I become uh a parent I know what is right and I know what is wrong\n\n\nSo I would really instill in my children 's in my kids' mind that, sex is really not a bad thing\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat do you mean sex is not a bad thing\n\n\nSex is not a bad thing within the context of something\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah to have sex is good really good after marriage\n\n<$B> \n\nAfter marriage   yes  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   that 's how you should explain to your children\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but you see it 's not  naman  the parents' fault\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\n  I mean  I can't say that\n\n<$A> \n\n But if if   the background if if the persuasive uh, ability  tama ba  \n\n<$B> \n\nPersuasive ability of what\n\n<$A> \n\nOf the parents\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nIf it 's good then the kids will not be will not buckle under pressure 'cause\n\n<$B> \n\nThey 'll not give in\n\n<$A> \n\nThey 'll not give in from peer pressure\n\n\nSo it really comes it boils down to or it comes down to still the basic unit, of the community\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay you mean   the family  \n\n<$A> \n\n Which is   the family\n\n<$B> \n\nDoes it mean that if a teenager engages in sex then I will directly assume that the parents are terrible\n\n<$A> \n\nThen there there must be a lack of uh uh you know  explaining\n\n<$B> \n\nGuidance\n\n<$A> \n\nGuidance or you know there should be uh like a one-on-one talk or a man or\n\n<$B> \n\nDo you think you 're gonna have a\n\n<$A> \n\nFather-to-son talk or a mother-to-daughters talk mother-to-daughter talk or mother-to-son talk and vice versa so   I think  \n\n<$B> \n\n Do you think   you 're gonna actually talk to your own kid about sex\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I would\n\n<$B> \n\nDid your Dad\n\n<$A> \n\nI will\n\n<$B> \n\nDid your Dad talk to you about sex\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yeah he did when he saw me uh\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat\n\n<$A> \n\n Ano ba 'yon  'cause I can't I was like twelve years old when he looked at my uh drawer and he saw some pornographic materials inside\n\n\nThen he said hey this is this is really not what it 's uh uh meant to be or meant for it 's not what it 's meant for \n\n<$B> \n\nWhat do you mean\n\n<$A> \n\n'Cause the acts shown in that material are disgusting in a way it 's not supposed to be that\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat made you buy them\n\n<$A> \n\nUh friends gave it to me\n\n<$B> \n\nYou 're not gonna admit you bought them\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't have that kind of money\n\n<$B> \n\nUh back then\n\n<$A> \n\nBack then \n\n I don't have that kind of money to buy\n\n\nMaybe my friends got it from their brothers or cousins or I don't know\n\n\nSo, we had that little talk and, it kinda, you know it kinda stuck in my mind\n\n<$B> \n\nThat what\n\n<$A> \n\nThat it 's, sex is really with responsibility, \n\n<$B> \n\nYou know I 'm so confused about pre-marital sex actually\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\nMy views are changing\n\n\nWell before my best friends and I it it was like a no no thing until people close to us started confiding about actually doing it\n\n\nAnd it 's like how can we hate her we know her too well and she 's not that kind of person\n\n\nOr how can we judge her when we know who she is I mean her character doesn't change just because she engaged in it\n\n\n  So all  of a sudden when when people near you close to you start really doing it you 're forced to change your outlook\n\n\nAnd also forces you to look deep down and make you question your own values \n\n<$A> \n\n Okay   \n\n\nYou have to question your your, uh your strength also 'cause, if you 're really strong inside, you, \n\n<$B> \n\nWill resist the temptation\n\n<$A> \n\nFrom your friends\n\n<$B> \n\nWell yeah, pre-marital sex is still a sticky issue as far as I 'm concerned   sticky  and sensitive\n\n<$A> \n\n Sticky   that 's it  e  \n\n\nSo if the foundation is good about sex\n\n<$B> \n\nMy the families of my friends are like, well-respected families\n\n<$A> \n\nBut you don't know what 's what goes inside the  the the house the home,   maybe  \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh I 've   been with these people since grade school\n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe inside the house they 're   not  \n\n<$B> \n\n Dysfunctional   \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah they 're not they 're not the ideal family, \n\n<$B> \n\nWe went to the same school\n\n\nWell anyways,  basta  it 's just a sensitive issue and it makes me really look down deep inside what is really my stand regarding pre-marital sex\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what 's your stand\n\n<$B> \n\nMy stand is it 's still wrong it 's still a sin against God\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nNothing can make it right\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay I have this question\n\n<$B> \n\nWait\n\n\nNothing can make it right but having love in it will probably make it a little less wrong\n\n\nNot right uh it 'll just lessen the guilt\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay what if you 're uh in this situation, uh you had a few drinks few laughs listen to music\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then\n\n<$A> \n\nThen you stumble into doing it\n\n\nHow would you feel\n\n<$B> \n\nAs in I 'm drunk\n\n<$A> \n\nIf if\n\n<$B> \n\nAt that point I 'm tipsy I 'm drunk\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm you like the guy\n\n<$B> \n\nNot love\n\n<$A> \n\nYou just you like him you you love him\n\n\nOkay let 's put it that way you love him\n\n\nBut you stumbled into doing it\n\n\nHow would you how would you react I mean right after doing it\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'd probably cry\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\nI didn't imagine it to be that way\n\n<$A> \n\nBut the two of you I mean you love each other\n\n\nYou know that you 're gonna end up with him\n\n<$B> \n\nWho knows that for sure\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay let 's let 's change the the the what 's this the scene or the situation\n\n\nWhat if you 're gonna get married tomorrow\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd suddenly the guy knocks at your door and says hey Chinks it 's just like you know just a formality why don't we get down and dirty\n\n\nLet 's do it tonight instead of tomorrow the wedding day \n\n\nWill you do it\n\n<$B> \n\nProbably not\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy because you 're tired\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm tired\n\n<$A> \n\nAfter preparing for\n\n<$B> \n\nFor the wedding\n\n<$A> \n\nWedding\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'd wanna look good\n\n\n  I wanna get  a beauty sleep beauty rest\n\n<$A> \n\n But you know   \n\n\nBut you know even if you 're tired it only takes a minute to do it  \n\n<$B> \n\nI wouldn't imagine my first time to take a minute  \n\n\nI 'd wanna go through all the motions and all the preparations\n\n<$A> \n\nBut if you did it the day before your wedding is it wrong, \n\n<$B> \n\nHard to answer I don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what 's wrong with\n\n<$B> \n\nDoing it the week before\n\n<$A> \n\nA week before\n\n\nA year before\n\n\nUh two years before, \n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nBut you see my point\n\n<$B> \n\nI see your point\n\n<$A> \n\nSo\n\n<$B> \n\nI 've never been asked that question\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah but it makes sense  'no  \n\n<$B> \n\nIt makes sense but I still think it 's not right\n\n\nI don't know if\n\n\nCan we say there 's a degree in wrong-ness level of wrong-ness or probably not wrong-ness degree of guilt\n\n<$A> \n\nDegree of guilt\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know   I 'm not sure  \n\n<$A> \n\n I like that  , degree of guilt\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat 's the nicest thing you imagine you 'd do to a girl\n\n\nI mean I 'm not talking about physical context\n\n\nDo to a girl in terms of uh what you can do for her, make her happy\n\n<$A> \n\nInstead of, having sex\n\n<$B> \n\nOh no not within the context of sex\n\n<$A> \n\nOh what\n\n<$B> \n\nNothing what makes a girl happy\n\n\nYou know sex is not the only thing that can make a girl happy\n\n<$A> \n\nBuy her shoes\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yeah buy her shoes\n\n\nThat would make me very happy\n\n<$A> \n\nBuy her shoes buy her jewelry\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen are you gonna give me my engagement ring\n\n<$A> \n\nUh it 's a surprise\n\n<$B> \n\nI wanna be surprised now\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's not anymore a surprise\n\n<$B> \n\nHonestly when\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's a surprise  nga e  if I tell you when then it 's not a surprise anymore\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen will your parents know that we 're engaged\n\n<$A> \n\nAs soon as I give you\n\n<$B> \n\nSo they don't know that we 're engaged now\n\n<$A> \n\nNo but you know the formality\n\n<$B> \n\nSo what do they know now\n\n<$A> \n\nThat we 're gonna get married soon\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThat I 've decided already that you 're the one I want you 're my love\n\n<$B> \n\nI feel like having Mongolian barbecue tonight buffet\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't like\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy not\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'm in a budget that 's why\n\n<$B> \n\nNo it 's my treat\n\n\n  It 's  my turn\n\n<$A> \n\n No   \n\n\nActually, Mongolian barbecue is not for me\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy not\n\n<$A> \n\nCan't finish it\n\n<$B> \n\nOh you make your own bowl\n\n<$A> \n\nNah it 's okay\n\n<$B> \n\nI I I 'm really hungry, I 'm hungry\n\n<$A> \n\n Di

now is you\n\n<$B> \n\nOr sex\n\n<$A> \n\nNo it 's you\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah right\n\n<$A> \n\nNo yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nWell, I had a bad day today, a real bad day\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah why\n\n<$B> \n\nWell for one uhm I looked at the bulletin board of the M B A program\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I did not recognize a single name in the Dean 's List\n\n\nAnd I realized most of my batchmates have graduated while I am still half-way through and I shifted to a different masteral program\n\n\nI 'm not even sure if I 'll finish it\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you feel like you were left behind\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nBy your batchmates\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nBut you changed uh programs right\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich I 'm having difficulty finishing because of all the travel schedules\n\n\nBecause of my work which brings me to any point in the Philippines at any given time\n\n<$A> \n\nBut your problem is a fun problem right because you 're enjoying your course your program\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but I 'm having difficulty\n\n\nI 'm getting insecure whether I 'll finish it or not\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you mean you you 're not enjoying your course\n\n<$B> \n\nI am enjoying my course\n\n\nI 'm worried I might not be able to finish it like\n\n<$A> \n\nSo if if you 're\n\n<$B> \n\nI dropped my M B A didn't I\n\n<$A> \n\nIf you 're enjoying it there 's no, you shouldn't think that you will not finish it\n\n<$B> \n\nNo my problem is not whether I enjoy it or not\n\n\nMy problem is the time, \n\n\nMy problem is whether term after term   I 'll  be able to enroll\n\n<$A> \n\n Oh   \n\n\nIt 's just a matter of uh proper scheduling and proper planning\n\n<$B> \n\nI feel like I 'm driving my body crazy\n\n\nAnd you know the sad part is I 'm enjoying my course so much as in well I never thought English could be so difficult\n\n\nI 'm really enjoying it because I 'm really learning but my problem is I might not be maximizing the opportunities for learning because I don't

{"text": "<$A> \n\n They 're Playing Our Song \n\n<$B> \n\nI don't have enough money to buy tickets\n\n<$A> \n\nNo uhm if you want to buy more tickets uhm I think you can get them at all uhm Ticketrons at the same time \n\n\nThey give you discounts if you buy them in groups\n\n\nUhm also if you 're interested in watching other plays if you 're interested in watching other plays we have one right\n\n\nWe have uhm I think in Repertory Philippines a new season we have Kiss of the Spider Woman which is a straight musical and then the River in Through the Woods straight play\n\n\nThen we have Aimee 's View and Murder for Rent what I think happens to be which happens to be I think a comedy\n\n\nAnd then for children 's theater they 're having Jack and the Beanstalk which runs I think it started already in July and it 's going to run through 'til December\n\n<$B> \n\nSo how could I get one\n\n<$A> \n\nYou can go to Repertory Philippines at Shangri-La Plaza at the fifth level you 'll find the box office there\n\n<$B> \n\nYou were able to watch They 're Playing Our Song right\n\n<$A> \n\nYes I watched it twice\n\n<$B> \n\nTwice\n\n<$A> \n\n'Cause Lea Salonga was so amazing\n\n\nShe and Adrian Pang had this chemical reaction on stage\n\n\nThey just complement each other without the other having to hog the limelight\n\n\nYou should have seen it\n\n\nIt was amazing\n\n<$B> \n\nSounds great\n\n\nBut  how was it\n\n<$A> \n\nIt was it was different especially the acoustics of the theater\n\n\nIt was held in the Aguinaldo theater and the theater is very very preserved\n\n\nIt 's very nice\n\n\nAll the acoustics are very uhm, even with their sounds\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's really great\n\n\nWhat\n\n<$A> \n\nYes have you have you already purchased your tickets for Miss Saigon\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm planning to have one but I 'm still thinking what 's the most specific date that I 'll be watching that\n\n<$A> \n\nYou should be watching if you want to watch all the Lea Salonga shows you should watch all the evening shows because Lea will only be doing the evening shows for three months\n\n\nAll evening shows only\n\n\nThe rest will have an alternate for the afternoon during matinees and then for the rest of the succeeding months because it 's gonna uhm run from October until March uhm\n\n\nThere will be another person playing the role of Kim\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that 's really that sounds too bad so I really have to purchase the tickets   right now  \n\n<$A> \n\n And not   to mention how much it costs for the orchestra\n\n\nI think it costs like four thousand plus for the evening and then for the orchestra side right three thousand plus\n\n\nAnd all the good and cheap seats are already sold out\n\n<$B> \n\nOh my God so how am I going to purchase the tickets\n\n\n  I don't have  \n\n<$A> \n\n Oh my God   oh my God you could have a credit card\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's too bad\n\n<$A> \n\nTeacher Donna why are you so busy\n\n\nWon't you join us\n\n<$B> \n\nTeacher Donna\n\n<$A> \n\nTeacher Donna teacher Donna has a sore throat\n\n<$B> \n\nHow about you\n\n\nWould you like to watch Miss Saigon too\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm I 'm not interested\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat are you barbaric or something  \n\n<$C> \n\nSort of\n\n<$A> \n\nGet cultured get out of that cage and get moving\n\n<$C> \n\nDon't disturb me I 'm busy\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat are you doing anyway\n\n<$C> \n\nI 'll be observed later okay\n\n<$A> \n\nNo wonder you look so pretty\n\n<$C> \n\nOf course I have to\n\n<$A> \n\nReally and blooming like a wild  sampaguita  flower  \n\n<$B> \n\nWere you  observed already last week\n\n<$A> \n\nThank God no  \n\n<$B> \n\nYou weren't but I thought you were you would be observed also\n\n<$A> \n\nI thought so too\n\n\nApparently somebody forgot their watch so, \n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's good news anyway   right  \n\n<$A> \n\n So   yes I will still be waiting for another couple of sleepless nights until somebody observes me in my class and I hope it 's not in your loony class   because you  have  Anton Silva  well among the students\n\n<$B> \n\n I hope so   \n\n\nTalking about  Antonio Silva  you know what he did this morning he was howling all over the place\n\n<$A> \n\nHowling\n\n\nYes did you put on his leash because I reprimanded him the last time for kicking somebody 's table\n\n<$B> \n\nReally I didn't know that\n\n<$A> \n\nYes it happened to be the teacher 's table\n\n<$B> \n\n Oh my God\n\n<$A> \n\nYes so no wonder you didn't know about it \n\n\nRez you know what movie I saw last night\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat\n\n<$A> \n\nMy God you 'll never believe it\n\n\nI saw the Sixth Sense again on H B O, \n\n<$B> \n\nSo so uhm was it uhm the same thing as you 've watched it before\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm probably I 've watched it around six times already\n\n\nSo it 's not as scary as it was the first time I saw it because I remember the second time I saw it I saw it with you guys and you guys saw it for the first time and I could just I could just I could just see clearly now as I close my eyes the look on your faces, how freaked out you were\n\n<$B> \n\nThen you were just teasing us always\n\n\nFor example there was a scene there already and then you 're you always tell us that uhm okay look at the scene look closely to it and then we were very excited  di ba  waiting for that scene to come\n\n<$A> \n\nExactly\n\n\nAnd then by the time I watched Blair Witch I was already emotionally disturbed after seeing the Sixth Sense okay\n\n<$B> \n\nSo I thought that you wouldn't watch that anymore because it really scares you that much\n\n<$A> \n\nIt took me, uhm it was shown October November December January February, around until January just to get over the movie just to get over the fear of the movie\n\n\nAnd then by the time I was able to watch it again it now marks as one of my favorite movies of all time\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's really interesting right though have you watched other movies aside from the Sixth Sense after watching that movie\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm I 've seen the Blair Witch the Blair  what 's that Blair Witch\n\n<$B> \n\nBlair Witch \n\n<$A> \n\nBlair Witch one was it that one\n\n\nAnd then I saw The Haunting with you guys\n\n\nThree scary movies in a row is enough to give you a nervous breakdown so  \n\n\nBut I recovered don't worry I recovered\n\n\nBut lately for the past few months I haven't seen anything because of the bombings\n\n\nMy parents refused to let me in the you know to let me inside malls just so I could watch movies  ,  I was not allowed\n\n\nYou may never know what will happen to your safety\n\n\nSo they refused \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh that 's too bad because a lot of movies shown lately are really good like The Patriot \n\n<$A> \n\n what 's it about\n\n<$B> \n\nAbout Patriot\n\n\nIt 's like uh the continentals like they they 're fighting with each other with this country and then and then the most interesting part was that this a family are really bound together they they really are so close together\n\n<$A> \n\nWas this the one with Mel Gibson\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah with Mel Gibson\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd also you know what\n\n\nWe 're really so interested while watching the movie because it 's really uh talks about the bonding of a certain family like the family of Mel Gibson\n\n\nAnd then especially this kid when she was really crying because Mel Gibson was going to uhm to a war again\n\n<$A> \n\nThis revolves around what century what year\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm not really sure eighteenth I think nineteenth century\n\n<$A> \n\nEighteenth century\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I I don't know I 'm not really sure about it\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat country, \n\n<$B> \n\nI forgot  \n\n<$A> \n\nWere you really watching  were you really watching\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm just so amused with all the things that are happening in the movie especially those uh people who are right beside us because they 're really   <unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n<$A> \n\n The movie that   I have uhm\n\n\nLet 's uhm be wholesome   and  not worldly here\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nNow the movie I have failed to watch and I have regretted missing is, uhm Erin Brockovich \n\n<$B> \n\nUh yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nHave you seen it\n\n\nIt 's about what\n\n\nI have I have no idea\n\n<$B> \n\nErin Brockovich \n\n\nIs it uhm what was that Julia Roberts <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nI forgot\n\n\nWas it 'cause it was shown a long long time ago  \n\n<$A> \n\nDid your parents ever tell you you had uhm, short attention span  \n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's my problem anyway  \n\n\nSo don't talk about those uhm movies that were shown a few month ago already 'cause I can't even talk about the   ones that  I 've seen   yesterday and a few days  ago\n\n<$A> \n\n I 'm afraid   \n\n\n I 'm afraid that   \n\n\nLater on at three you might even forget that we had this conversation  di ba , \n\n<$B> \n\nThen\n\n<$A> \n\nUh what time is your next class\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's about nine o'clock\n\n<$A> \n\nSo we have fifteen minutes more to kill  \n\n<$B> \n\nTo talk about  ay  \n\n\nAre you done with your conduct grades already\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nConduct grades, \n\n<$A> \n\nYes and it 's uhm\n\n\nI 've already encoded it I 've already computed it, a week before it 's supposed to be due  ,  although I I was so pissed off when they had to uh I mean after finished deliberating it  ,  we had we had to grade it in another numerical manner like one two three four five \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then all of a sudden after you 've finished all the work after encoding it to your record book, to the computer to your diskette to the network all of a sudden they say that they have to change it\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI think it 's most annoying\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd careless\n\n<$B> \n\nSo   you know what  \n\n<$A> \n\n They apologized   but, at our expense\n\n\nAnd then now they have to rush us they say it for example they say they say that they have to be they have to be changed on Wednesday and the due date is already on Thursday\n\n\nI mean what were they thinking\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\nAnd one more thing because the other teachers are are done with their grading already so they need another extra work to do right\n\n<$A> \n\nExactly\n\n\nIt is just like\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's just a waste of time\n\n<$A> \n\nNot just a waste of time but they think that the teachers don't have anything to do at all and, ask them to do this to do that\n\n<$B> \n\nThey always have to rush things out\n\n\nSo especially now how would they know that they 'll be grading the the same persons again so\n\n<$A> \n\nExactly especially for the first grading period you are not that familiar with your students\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd what I did was in class I would get my record book and then I would call them according to their numbers and I saw their you know I 'd see who they are you would have an idea on how they behave in class\n\n\nIt 's easier for it 's it 's easier for it 's easier for uhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nArvin and company\n\n\nYes Arvin\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's easier for uh it 's easier for what do you call this\n\n\nFor, for regular subject teachers  ,  to see their students because they get to meet their students every day unlike the special subject teachers only get to meet their students once a week,  \n\n\nArvin have you gotten your tickets for Miss Saigon\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$D> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat show uhm what date are you watching\n\n<$D> \n\nWhat theater\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat date\n\n<$D> \n\nWhat date\n\n\nUh December twenty-three at eight P M\n\n\nUh Balcony one side   right   \n\n<$A> \n\n December twenty-three   eight P M\n\n\nWould that still be Lea\n\n<$D> \n\nYes that   will still  be Lea\n\n<$A> \n\n Because what uh   \n\n\nWhat I 've heard was there is no guarantee even for the evening shows that it 's gonna be Lea\n\n\nAgain I don't know if they 're trying to pull down uhm Ticketron or it 's really a part of they 're not yet sure if Lea 's gonna be playing all the evening shows\n\n<$D> \n\nI read in one newspaper recently that uh it 's Ces Campos who will only perform uhm two times a week for from October to December   two thousand  \n\n<$A> \n\n Forgive me   forgive me for saying this but I don't know who 's Ces Campos\n\n<$D> \n\nCes Campos\n\n<$A> \n\nCes Campos\n\n<$D> \n\nYeah Ces Campos\n\n<$A> \n\nWho is she\n\n<$D> \n\nThe other Kim\n\n<$A> \n\nI I I I know that but, what\n\n<$B> \n\nShe played the role of Kim when she went to Australia\n\n<$A>

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood afternoon Mike\n\n<$B> \n\nYo, \n\n<$A> \n\nUh how about you Mel what can you say about this afternoon\n\n<$C> \n\nI 'm tired uh but I 'm fine except I 'm tired\n\n<$B> \n\nSame here tired fine\n\n\nHow about you Mercy are you tired and fine  \n\n<$A> \n\nMe I 'm okay it 's just that I 'm having this kind of interest right now something about my hobbies that I would like to share\n\n\nBut I would like to think about other else to hear other sides or other people 's comments about their hobbies or something like what they do for during how many days already for these past days\n\n\nSo what can you say about your hobbies or what interests you right now\n\n<$B> \n\nUh I 'm currently indulged in reading lots of books mostly analytical books\n\n\nSo uh more on the line of psychology philosophy religion people relations that sort of stuff\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd oh can you tell something about that\n\n<$B> \n\nWell the latest book that I 'm reading is by a bishop named uh John Shelby Spong okay\n\n\nThe title of the book is Why Christianity Must Change Or Die \n\n\nIt 's a quite controversial book uhm here uh Fr Fr Spong uh believes that uh most of the dictums or most of the practices of the of the church whether Catholic or Protestant are already outdated and already uhm uh not very useful anymore in modern society\n\n\nSo he suggests ways in which we can uh revive or uh revive our faith or make the faith more significant and more attuned to the times\n\n<$A> \n\nI think it 's a very deep or enriching kind of book isn't it\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I I I should say so\n\n\nThe language that is used by the author is quite deep but I like books like that they kind of challenge me\n\n<$A> \n\nHow about you Mel what kind of books do you like to read\n\n<$C> \n\nAlthough I do have interests in analytical and psychological aspects of life I I believe that adventure and espionage interest me too\n\n\nAnd right now I am reading Clive Cussler 's, wow I forgot the title of the book but geez I 'm just  wind  up but that 's okay \n\n\nAnyway and I 'm already nearing it 's just like this Shanghai Express and I think this person just never dies the main character Dirk Pitt that is\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay aside from books let 's talk about other kinds of interests that you have right now\n\n\nCan you tell something about any interest you like to talk about Mike\n\n<$B> \n\n Well I do have many interests but uhm they 're seasonal  \n\n\nSo it really depends upon uh my mood for a certain uh number of months\n\n\nLike I said my indulgence right now probably for four years now is really books I 'm really into books right now\n\n\nThose kinds of books but uhm if you just ask me what are my other interests well uh well you you know Mercy I I love music so I love listening to music\n\n\nUh I like to sing  e  dance and all of that stuff yeah\n\n\nSo that would be one of my main interests\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat do you do during weekends uh you Mel\n\n<$C> \n\nI bake\n\n<$A> \n\nOh really\n\n<$C> \n\nI bake\n\n\nActually before I really came uh before I taught here I trained in a hotel because I was supposed to be shipping to New York\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah I was supposed to go there because I wanted to become a chef\n\n\nBut well I was lured here so here at school\n\n\nBut anyway that won't stop me from my dream\n\n\nSo but actually because there 's two aspects like being a chef but what I wanted in particular is to become a pastry chef so I 'd like to train more with the cakes and all those frilly stuff and presentations\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm you know what Mike Mike also I think you have that family business about pastries\n\n\nYeah you have the same characteristics or same interests\n\n\nThat 's good\n\n\nOkay aside from that what else\n\n<$B> \n\nWell since you mentioned it I also cook\n\n\nUhm I cook more than bake uh but I like baking too\n\n\nIt 's it 's sort of uh a hand-me-down kind of a, talent or or hobby\n\n\nUhm it started off with my grandmother on my Mom 's side\n\n\nShe she she loved to cook and she turned it to a business and up to now we still have that business\n\n\nFrom my grandmom to my Mom and then down to me so we 're all we 're more or less a cooking family yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nUh one time at the mall I saw you and is it with are you with your sister and grandmother\n\n\nOr was that your mother that you were going down the escalator from, Glorietta Four, \n\n<$B> \n\nWell I would like to think I would like to believe that was my Mom because if that was my grandmom you would have seen a paranormal uh phenomenon  \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so what else, \n\n<$C> \n\nWhat do you like to cook\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah that 's good\n\n<$B> \n\nMy specialty 's pastas\n\n\nI love cooking pasta and uhm uhm like I said my Mom cooks\n\n\nThe things that she 's good at cooking I can't make\n\n\nLike I can't make the usual  adobo  I 'm not good at that  nilaga  but my Mom makes fabulous there 's  nilaga  waiting for me at home right now\n\n\nIt 's really really fabulous\n\n\nShe cooks  empanada  \n\n\nHer bestsellers like  pastillas  I can't do that\n\n\nBut the thing is when it comes to pasta when anyone orders pasta from us I do the cooking because my Mom cannot make pastas as well as I can\n\n\nThank you\n\n<$A> \n\nWow\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm actually I 've been practicing making pasta but it 's just like the simple  pesto  and uh  pomodoro  from scratch\n\n\nAlthough it 's not yet uh I have not really road-tested it too much so it 's not appreciated yet just yet because I 'm I 'm more I 'm I 'm really more of like a vegetarian\n\n\nSo I try to get into that cooking since I also love pasta myself so I tried to experiment with the basic I think I agree that Italian cooking and French cooking are very basic so I 'm trying that\n\n\nI 've I 'm kinda I 'm I 'm kind of like the traditional cooking first\n\n\nSo there\n\n<$A> \n\nMe I 'm not very good in cooking because I 'm an only child and my mother is always there for me\n\n\nSo that 's why it 's it 's really my frustration right now\n\n\nBut I think it there 's still hope I think\n\n\nAnd then one thing I would like to bring up with you is something about your vocation or our vocation our teaching career so I don't think it 's a boring kind of thing to be brought up today\n\n\nI think me for myself I like to talk about my kids my students my grade one students because they 're very very very active very alert and every day is such kind of a new experience for me\n\n\nAnd like what I have shared this afternoon  during our colloquium we talked I talked and I shared about this kind of boy\n\n\nHis name is Juan and this boy is very very active very very alert and something like sometimes just squeezing twitching or anything that you would like to think about him he does it\n\n\nFor example standing without asking permission but at the other side I talked and I shared with the group something about him that touched my heart this morning\n\n\nHeart  ha  \n\n\nIt 's like he approached me this morning at my table and he said Teacher I will be going to States, it 's much longer but then I just have to say this to you in advance that I 'll be going there and I will not forget you \n\n\nImagine coming from a Grade One student and then he said I will send a package for you \n\n\nAnd you know what what 's inside the package\n\n\nThe very first thing that he thought about is he will replace my old chalk holder\n\n\nImagine that\n\na boy saying that kind of stuff for me\n\n\nWhat do you think about him\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I guess he 's very thoughtful\n\n\nYeah I 'm I 'm not really I have to admit I 'm not very well-oriented with the uh uh psychological profile of Grade Two students I 'm more oriented with the upper grades\n\n\nUhm but the most I would say oh I guess he 's a very thoughtful kid\n\n\nUhm he knows he knows what you want see and he he thinks about you and he 's very sociable too which that that 's very characteristic of many students in San Agustin yeah\n\n<$C> \n\nActually Juan happens to be my student and I would share the same thoughts about him\n\n\nHe 's very thoughtful\n\n\nHe 's actually very sweet and many times actually he would ask the most if I guess for a Grade One student he would ask most high-faluting questions\n\n\nOr sometimes if I would say if I talk to them to the whole class I would say  a word that 's not familiar he would ask all the time\nwhat 's the meaning of this word for example\n\n\nThen I don't know it wasn't just one occasion but it was like several occasions he would ask so I I think he 's like curious he wants to learn\n\n\nBut sometimes we 'd deviate from my subject which is which is Music\n\n\nBut I 'd be glad really like to talk to them all the time and I remember seeing him in the mall\n\n<$A> \n\nReally\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah I think that was my first I think that was my first experience in the mall\n\n\nActually somebody calling out my name really loud in front of my Mom and my brother but it wasn't anything really embarrassing\n\n\nI mean although I I guess in the  beginning I wasn't really used to it so it just felt so weird\n\n\nIt just felt so weird there in the mall but uh he was with his actually with his sister and parents\n\n\nSo  first it 's like I felt I don't know if it 's like embarrassing or something but I guess I just have to get used to it and it didn't end there\n\n\nWherever I go there 's somebody you know somebody will see you\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah get used to it\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah you see I don't know\n\n\nSome of them they saw I think they were like they saw me like in the restaurant and then I think at Mass\n\n\nSo the next the week after, Miss you know what you were at Magallanes this uh last Sunday I saw you you were wearing sneakers you were wearing jeans  you were wearing a striped shirt and you were wearing a parka and you were with your sister \n\n\n But no I don't have sisters it was my Mom \n\n\nSo I don't know probably I will get used to that\n\n\nSo like okay so wherever I go even though just in the grocery uh I am likely to see somebody\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's a very nice kind of experience we have been getting with these kind of pupils\n\n\nBut then how about paper works what can you say about it\n\n<$B> \n\nWell thank God I 'm not teaching language anymore\n\n\nLast year I had agh enormous load of paperwork 'cause I was uh I used to be a Language teacher Grade Seven Language teacher\n\n\nSo that means uhm every week you have spelling lists to the sum of three hundred fifty spelling lists to check and then every week you have a quiz to check\n\n\nAlmost every day you have seatworks you have the homeworks you have the notebooks and you have the the mastery test twice\n\n\nAnd it 's in a quarter and it 's not a joke to to check Language tests 'cause they 're they 're whole sentences and Grade Seven kids don't really write very good sentences and they don't write well okay\n\n\nSo uhm it was horrible and the activity sheets I had uh it 's a good thing I had an empty desk beside me last year \n\n The whole desk was filled with with activity sheets for the next quarter\n\n\nYou could hardly see me behind the pile of behind a stack of papers\n\n\nWell fortunately now uh they transferred me to Speech and Reading\n\n\nI 'm only teaching two three sections in Reading and there 's a lot less paperwork now\n\n\nSpeech no paperwork at all so uh I thank my coordinator for that", "subdomain":

band\n\n<$B> \n\nQuit the band, \n\n<$A> \n\nIt depends\n\n\nWhat if the band becomes successful, then\n\n<$B> \n\nI will not know that\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nI have no idea if we are going to be successful you know\n\n\nYou see other bands they don't you know they don't expect to be that big but they just do what they do and they they get records and they and then they make lots of sales and they become big and they just die out you know\n\n\nBut think about Wolfgang they didn't expect to be that big but you know but they they they got into the international market and, now they 're known at least here\n\n<$A> \n\nDo they sell records outside the Philippines\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah they they sell records outside but uhm they they have a they have a contract with ah Sony Epic\n\n\nEpic is a big name in the international scene you know, \n\n\nThey 're they 're hitting big outside   I think  \n\n<$A> \n\n So what   do you think is the problem with the band\n\n\nFor me, in some ways you don't really make that good music\n\n<$B> \n\nUs we make good music\n\n<$A> \n\nWell not all of you\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no our band makes good music but uhm I don't know\n\n\nI 'm not sure if we 're gonna make it big like uh like the like Wolfgang or like the  the Beatles or you know like Led Zep \n\n I just wanna play music and then, be rich\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's uh that 's an after effect of uh of working of trying to perfect or trying to\n\n<$B> \n\nTrying to perfect our craft\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah we 're just trying to gel with the other members of the band, \n\n<$B> \n\nIf I if I leave the band, one of one of our band members might also leave so, \n\n\nI 'm not sure if if I leave uh that they 'll be you know they 'll continue playing music you know, \n\n<$A> \n\nI have a feeling that they they won't continue after you leave\n\n<$B> \n\nNo they 're gonna get someone else\n\n\nThat 's good for me because I could leave the band they could get someone else\n\n\nThat 's going to be their problem not mine man\n\n\nBefore I I thought that if I could teach someone else to play for me like you know substitute for me playing the guitar I could stay and just make music and I could leave and concentrate on my work\n\n\nBut now that I don't have any work \n\n<$A> \n\nWhat are you going to concentrate in\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nI 'm just you know thinking about making more money than before\n\n\nYou know my Dad said that I could look for another job but, but I have to but that that job has to have the same benefits which he used to have you know\n\n\nSo I 'm not sure I don't know what to do with my life right now, you know \n\n<$A> \n\nBut I really hope that that the resum\u00e9 you gave to Caltex you know they would they would see it\n\n<$B> \n\nThey won't get me they won't get me you know because I asked for a much <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nNo way they they give they give that kind of salary that that high\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> they do they do\n\n\nThey do give that kind of salary but not for me you know\n\n\nI 've been working for three years in that kind of job but I 'm not sure if I I 'd fit the qualifications\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat what I remember they were looking for a person who has more than two years of experience and you you 've got three so\n\n<$B> \n\nRight now I 've got three before I used to have two and a half years\n\n\nI think that 's not worth it you know\n\n\nI wanna look for a job in uh you know McDonald 's McDonald 's\n\n\nRemember I I I answered a question in H R\n\n\nShe asked me why do you want to work in McDonald 's and I said because I love Big Mac \n\n\nThat 's kind of silly but you know it was honest\n\n\nIt was honest because you know that 's what I really feel\n\n\nI really want to work there but because I I I don't want to work there because\n\n<$A> \n\nI think I think the manager thinks you were giving a sarcastic answer\n\n<$B> \n\nShe 's stupid\n\n\nShe didn't know where she she didn't know what I was trying to say to her\n\n\nI told her that because I was honest with myself I was sincere\n\n\nShe asked me if what she asked me if the reason why I wanted to work there \n\n\nI told her I love Big Mac what more should you ask for from a person who has worked in a company who loves their product you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYou got a point there\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I know I have a point there\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you want to work\n\n<$B> \n\nBut they don't understand that yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you wanna work do you wanna work under Allan\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat 's he at what 's his work\n\n<$A> \n\nNo he he wants to he wants to make a company, uh a holding company\n\n\nThen from there then they would think about what kind of venture that they would really go into\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know what I think\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI think that Allan could be much more you know successful than he is right now because he has talent he has skills\n\n\n  He is  intelligent\n\n<$A> \n\n Skills in what   \n\n<$B> \n\nHe knows how\n\n<$A> \n\nI think he 's well he 's successful in, in being a stock  stock trader so\n\n<$B> \n\nStock trader\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know what he 's thinking right now but what I 've heard is that he wants to leave he wants to leave his company and start\n\n<$B> \n\nStart his own\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat about Glenn \n\n\nYou you you told me a while ago that Glenn would like to work for him\n\n\nUh I don't know 'cause Glenn is out of job right now right\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah so I think he he wants to concentrate also on having you know having our dream come true having a company, but it really depends on him\n\n<$B> \n\nWe did that before\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah right\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know what happened right\n\n\nSo what do you expect right now what do you expect me to believe what do you expect me to think man\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know I 'm sure there 's\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know if they could\n\n<$A> \n\nI would rather work with you Brian and Lemuel in a company instead of having to work with those guys because, it will start all over again\n\n<$B> \n\nWill start all over again and it 's better to work if there 's just two\n\n\nThe two of you or the three of you could work better\n\n\nLess manpower less overhead, \n\n\nI don't know I just believe that uhm if you 'd have a hand on uh something you should work on it yourself not with others or someone else you don't trust\n\n\nAnd if you work with someone you trust that 'll be better\n\n<$A> \n\nYou 're talking pretty straight right now  \n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm not yet drunk\n\n<$A> \n\nWe 're not drinking anyway so, \n\n<$B> \n\nWell not yet but we 're gonna drink tonight we 're gonna drink\n\n<$A> \n\nYup\n\n<$B> \n\nWe 're gonna drink lots of beer\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's a very Filipino trait, \n\n\nBut the weird thing is you know in other countries they it 's very common it 's very ordinary for them to drink beer in the morning in the afternoon in the evening\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah like like Brian said when he was in the States he said uhm you could you know just go inside a house and go to the ref and open and see bottles of beer six packs\n\n\nIt 's quite common because they give beer to their guests  \n\n\nYou know, I really like to drink beer but I don't really like drinking hard liquor \n\n\nMake me make me dizzy and all and sleepy and the next day I get a hang-over but with beer\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd and we don't we don't try to find alcohol because we have problems or we have some big things that we want to forget but we just drink beer because we want to drink beer\n\n\nIt 's part it 's part and parcel of what what males should be in some in some ways\n\n\nWe could drink we could drink and eat at the same time but\n\n<$B> \n\nEat and drink the same\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah you don't really have to over-drink or over-abuse I mean abuse the, the alcohol that you 're you 're drinking\n\n<$B> \n\nRemember when we when we when we used to think that we could start a company or a restaurant or a bar and inside the bar we could put our pictures there and you know the people coming over are gonna ask who 's these guys in the picture \n\n\nAnd then we 're gonna say to them that 's us because you know it 's our friends who got the bar and it 's us who who put up the bar \n\n And they 're gonna be curious about it and they 're gonna ask stories about us\n\n\nAnd then someday you know we might we might get their picture and put it there on the wall so they 'd say they got their <unclear> word <unclear> the bar\n\n\nThey drank at the bar and they could remember they drank the bar and for, I don't know\n\n\nI mean after a few years and they 're going to go back to the bar with their kids or their friends and they 'll say that we had good things there and we had picture taking there\n\n<$A> \n\nThat was me that was me hey \n\n<$B> \n\n  That 's me  \n\n<$A> \n\n In the picture   that was me\n\n\nHey look at your Dad  \n\n\nUh I went to a bar once with Ivan and Ian\n\n<$B> \n\nWhere\n\n<$A> \n\nUh, some Bosconian owned it batch ninety-three\n\n<$B> \n\nWhere\n\n<$A> \n\nUh along Bautista Street, just uh\n\n<$B> \n\nPorch\n\n<$A> \n\nNo uh I forgot the name\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Porch\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I think so\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause because I think Angel knows the owner\n\n<$A> \n\nOwner\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean you know if it 's in Makati it it 's most probably the people there you know people there the owner of the bar used to work used to study at Don Bosco because <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nYou   just work there yeah  \n\n<$A> \n\n They consider this home   \n\n<$B> \n\nThey just work around the area\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nThey just and we studied in Don Bosco almost almost half of our lives right now\n\n\nIn Makati we 've we 've worked and lived in Makati for ten twenty years no I mean fifteen years\n\n\nWe 're not even thirty so half of our lives is in Makati", "subdomain":

\n\n The story   is really nice\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat 's the story\n\n<$B> \n\nAbout, uhm, what 's the story the story 's about uh, the relationship between\n\n<$A> \n\nBetween   a father and a daughter and  \n\n<$B> \n\n A father and a daughter   then afterwards as they as the   kid grow older  \n\n<$A> \n\n As the   yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah what happened is that their relationship becomes different\n\n<$A> \n\nTheir relationship became different why  \n\n\nAnyway what happened to that young girl when she got older what happened\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen she got older uhm their relationship was strained\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\nI no the here 's something because the girl grew up in Manila studied in Manila and\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd she 's from Bohol I think\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I see\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then uh there was a gap\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nBetween uh as she grew   older  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\nYou know there was a you know there was a gap uh between them and then finally before the girl left\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nUh, \n\n<$A> \n\nWhat happened to the girl, she grew up\n\n<$B> \n\n  You know  \n\n<$A> \n\n Why was the   relationship strained\n\n<$B> \n\nI really I I I think you really need to   read  so that you can really understand because if I 'm going to tell   you all these things it 's  \n\n<$A> \n\n To read it   \n\n\n Explain things to me   \n\n\nOkay what about Youngblood Two\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat about   Youngblood Two  \n\n<$A> \n\n You 've read it   already\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah some are nice some are not really that nice\n\n<$A> \n\n  But it 's okay  \n\n<$B> \n\n You were talking   about gender  sensitivity  \n\n<$A> \n\nA while ago\n\n<$B> \n\nA while ago\n\n<$A> \n\nNo uh yeah yeah yeah yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nI read an article about uh about gender that 's   not  really  related to what you 're  you were saying a while ago\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   okay\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's about uh, \n\n\nDo you believe that guys are really good in math\n\n<$A> \n\nI I I I I think generally guys are good in math I mean they 're better off than girls when it comes to math\n\n\nBut for say for the for the arts and the languages I think girls are far better   than guys  \n\n<$B> \n\n You really   believe or\n\n<$A> \n\nI guess I mean that 's an observation\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's an   observation  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   why\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause we were discussing a while ago in our class uh last time in our class we were discussing about  uh guys are really better in mathematics   than girls  \n\n<$A> \n\n Are they   \n\n<$B> \n\nThere are researches   made  and we were discussing why \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nWhy why\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm, the thing uh the reason that we have was that uhm guys are really better in mathematics perhaps because of our culture\n\n\nBecause   before  remember before uh   time  of Plato   and Socrates  \n\n<$A> \n\n Why   \n\n\n I mean   \n\n\n So you 're you 're speaking   about uh so it 's not not not just the Philippine culture  \n\n<$B> \n\nInternational   research  \n\n<$A> \n\n  Ano  okay   yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nIt was really known and there   are so  many researches that shows you know\n\n<$A> \n\n And then   \n\n\nAnd why is that   regarding Plato and  \n\n<$B> \n\n Researches that show   uh if you can remember uh those uh philosophers before, they were allowed to you know only guys were allowed to study mathematics   remember  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh   uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nSo girls are not allowed and then we were saying\n\n<$A> \n\nThey were not allowed to study   mathematics nor  were they allowed to neither were they allowed to study   yeah  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah because   \n\n\n Because   they 're they were second class   creatures  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nDenizens  okay \n\n<$B> \n\nCritters  \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nNo uh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then we were saying that what we have now although we are always saying that there 's equality between you know men and women what we have is the residual effect of that chauvinistic culture   handed now  to   our culture  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh really   \n\n\n Handed down   \n\n\nAnd then\n\n<$B> \n\nBut there are no researches that prove that the factors but they are just assumptions that we are saying  ,  because all all the researches are saying perhaps guys are really good in mathematics but the question of why   was not   explored \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh   \n\n\n Yeah   \n\n\nI was thinking of a  ,  more biological reason for that \n\n<$B> \n\n What do you think   \n\n\nBiological reason\n\n<$A> \n\nLike perhaps what what part of the brain functions uh for math  uh\n\n<$B> \n\nLeft\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah left okay \n\n\nPerhaps uh the left part of the brain of the guys work better\n\n<$B> \n\nBut if   you  can\n\n<$A> \n\n Or   \n\n<$B> \n\nTo think that   there are  also girls who are   really excelling  in mathematics\n\n<$A> \n\n Than girls   \n\n\n Uh yeah yeah   \n\n\nBut generally it 's the guys who excel in   math right  \n\n<$B> \n\n Because that   was our culture before \n\n<$A> \n\nUh   okay  \n\n<$B> \n\n  Di ba    like engineering are only for guys  ,   Di ba  \n\n\n  So arts  are only for girls \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n But   why do you think girls generally succeed in the languages than guys in languages rather than guys\n\n\nI mean, do you owe that to culture also\n\n<$B> \n\nPerhaps because  ,  language is,   in a sense a weaker  \n\n<$A> \n\n Not really     like like   girls\n\n<$B> \n\nWeak\n\n<$A> \n\nWeak what\n\n<$B> \n\nA weaker\n\n<$A> \n\nA weaker\n\n<$B> \n\nUh a weaker science unlike math it 's a hard   science  \n\n<$A> \n\n So it needs   analysis\n\n\nAnd language doesn't\n\n<$B> \n\nEven psychology  di ba  \n\n psychology\n\n<$A> \n\n Women psychologists   \n\n\nUh really but but the proponents but much most of the proponents in psychology are\n\n<$B> \n\nNowadays but before\n\n<$A> \n\nLike   Sigmund Freud  \n\n<$B> \n\n Most of them   are girls\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah really\n\nI never thought of that\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's why in psychology because it 's uh nowadays uh they are already promoting   in  school \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   yeah but languages languages why or arts\n\n\nIsn't uh girls uh go for arts more than guys do\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know I don't think so \n\n<$A> \n\nOr or   the number 's  just equal\n\n<$B> \n\n Because in   architecture classes  di ba  \n\n<$A> \n\nThere are more girls than   guys  \n\n<$B> \n\n There are   more girls uh there are more guys  ,  I think you can see and architecture is an art an art form\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh yeah   \n\n\nUh oh yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it doesn't really follow but come to think uh there are only few girls in architecture classes right   why  \n\n\nBecause of our culture  ,  \n\n\nBecause we are saying that architecture is only for guys  di ba  \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah  yeah   \n\n\n Because our culture dictates   \n\n\nOh yeah\n\n\nI took that up with uh my class last summer when I taught So-An sociology and anthropology\n\n\nAnd that 's it we were discussing about what professions uh uh in what professions do guys usually dominate and what professions do girls usually dominate\n\n\nAnd that 's it like what professions do girls usually dominate\n\n\nThese are teaching  ,  the teaching profession nursing \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nNursing\n\n<$A> \n\nLike most of our nurses are, girls most of our teachers are girls what else\n\n\nAnd I I I I I even pointed out to them that I had a classmate in college before who took up education and like his friends were trying to tease him about it why why are you taking up education   are you gay  or something\n\n\nSomething like things like that\n\n If you also take up nursing and you 're a guy like hey are you gay or something because our culture dictates that this profession is only for girls and this profession only for guys yeah \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah that 's true   that 's true\n\n<$A> \n\nEngineering\n\n\nYou know there 's this anecdote about what was that\n\n\nUh a boy and his father meeting an accident and the  uh the father 's boy what was that\n\n\nAnd the boy and his father meeting an accident and the father uh a vehicular accident at that and then the father died on the spot\n\n\nSo uh the people who witnessed the accident uh brought the kid or the boy to the hospital\n\n\nAnd when the boy  and when they reached the hospital they called for a surgeon\n\n\nAnd when the surgeon arrived she exclaimed oh I couldn't I couldn't operate on this boy \n\n\nAnd then they were asked why\n\n\nAnd then the surgeon said 'cause he 's my son\n\n<$B> \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nSo who 's the surgeon\n\n<$B> \n\nThe what the mother\n\n<$A> \n\nThe mother\n\n\nAnd what most of my students said oh perhaps the the father who died in the accident was just the foster father and things like that because usually we have this notion that surgeons are male or males or guys yeah \n\n<$B> \n\n Like in the story of one of our teachers last time\n\n\nUhm in a mathematics class  he gave uh examples of Maria painted the room  twice as much as\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah yeah yeah yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know the usual problem in mathematics and then all of the students are you know  ,  reacting like there 's something wrong\n\n\nWe cannot solve the problem because  ,  there 's something wrong in the problem because Maria doesn't really paint\n\n\nI mean the usual thing \n\n<$A> \n\n What   \n\n\nReacted\n\n\n Why   uh\n\n<$B> \n\nMaria don't paint   Maria  cooks  \n\n<$A> \n\n Okay   \n\n\nSo if the problem was stated that Maria cooked more recipes than whatever or went to market\n\n<$B> \n\nShe doesn't paint   she doesn't paint  she doesn't you know do carpentries   like  some old culture  \n\n<$A> \n\n She doesn't paint   \n\n\n Okay   \n\n\nYeah or like Plato what Plato doing the laundry  \n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know if it was Plato or Socrates  ,  who who had eight female teachers I think \n\n<$A> \n\n Who   \n\n\nEight female teachers\n\n\nAnd then what was the implication\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it was not even mentioned in the articles\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy because men are not really that significant before\n\n<$A> \n\nWomen\n\n<$B> \n\nUh I 'm yeah I mean women\n\n<$A> \n\nWomen are really not not that significant before\n\nyeah\n\n\nHow would you attribute that to what would you attribute that\n\n\nLike women weren't really that significant because, weren't really that significant because, how did that originate\n\n\nDo you know\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nLike we we were born we grew up in a patriarchal society wherein boys rule over girls\n\n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\nPerhaps perhaps it can be traced back uh to activities of the society before ancient society\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nUh, where, guys are the rulers\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nBut you see Cleopatra\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yeah Cleopatra but was she a ruler\n\n<$B> \n\nWas she a ruler\n\n<$A> \n\nWas she a ruler\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause usually uhm girls are, you know on their emotional side\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah, is that uh scientifically proven like girls are more emotional and guys more logical, \n\n<$B> \n\nI read an article about that uh I 'm not convinced\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah   it 's because  you know uh\n\n<$B> \n\n You know   \n\n\nIt depends upon the culture where you 're growing it depends upon the environment you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nThe environment shapes you  di ba    so  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   because in our R S class before we had this hand-out no not  it was really a book it was compiled\n\n\nThe the the articles there were uh compiled by Fr Yatco and then yeah he  when we went into the topic of marriage of marriage uh that 's it he mentioned that uh why should men and women be what, understand each other\n\n\nThen we he he enumerated the things that men should understand in woman women and women should understand in men like men are basically what, silent that they don't talk much\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yeah that 's true\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah   is that  \n\n<$B> \n\n Women   talk much\n\n<$A> \n\nWomen talk much do they\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nI guess so\n\n\nMy Mom and Dad are like that\n\n\nMy Mom talks more than my Dad does\n\n<$B> \n\nThey nag more often  \n\n<$A> \n\nMothers nag more often obviously\n\n\nOkay what else\n\n\nWhat 's the difference between men and women\n\n<$B> \n\nThe thing that we you were saying a while ago  ,  the thing that you were asking I mean about gender what was that \n\n<$A> \n\n What   \n\n\nGender\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah  uh there are words that you know\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yeah that uh like there 's this study that uh showing that gender defines what, social language\n\n\nIs that is that the term or something\n\n\nThat uh men have  have a different language quote unquote from women\n\n\nDo you believe in that\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah perhaps perhaps   like I have  \n\n<$A> \n\n Like men   speak in different language\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah because like like us   we  cannot talk about, I mean private things like", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

nothing it just, passed my mind\n\n<$B> \n\nOws really  ha   \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay, well, well by the way how do you find the college canteen food\n\n<$B> \n\nNo comment  \n\n<$A> \n\nNo comment don't

questions\n\n<$A> \n\nI find the college canteen food really fine\n\n<$B> \n\n  Yeah how often do you eat there  \n\n<$A> \n\n You know uhm uh   they are they are scientifically designed\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat do you mean by scientifically designed\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm they are more or less recycled over and over again\n\n<$B> \n\nRecycled you mean those wastes   are being  recycled again\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nFor example you have  adobo  for lunch and next thing you know you have chicken curry the next day, and then pork curry\n\n<$B> \n\nI see\n\n\nHow sure are you\n\n<$A> \n\n Ha  \n\n<$B> \n\nHow sure are you that they are recycling it\n\n<$A> \n\nWell it 's just my guess and   mine are usually  are correct\n\n<$B> \n\n Oh so it 's a hunch   \n\n\nThat 's good\n\n<$A> \n\nWell almost all almost always correct\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm I see, \n\n<$A> \n\nWhat can you say about the condominium uhm right beside Gokongwei\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I can see that its foundation are built almost huh uhm\n\n\nAll the ground there are being laid foundation and those pillars being built right now are big\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know the size of each room\n\n<$B> \n\nNo but I expect its gonna be very expensive it will  cost millions   for  one unit \n\n<$A> \n\n Okay   \n\n\nWhy don't we try to buy one\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no money\n\n<$A> \n\nSleep there for instead of uhm sleeping here in school for our overnight for our projects or thesis and everything\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah give me the money and I 'll buy one\n\n<$A> \n\nSure I I can supply you\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah you 're sure\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah uhm I know a certain uhm Ms  de Leon  who would be uhm willing to support you and if you should like I can introduce you to her\n\n<$B> \n\nReally\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah oh no no problem, \n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so\n\n<$A> \n\nBy the way how do you find the I D policy\n\n<$B> \n\nI D policy\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nWell it 's, I don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nYou   find it  fine or you   still look for something  \n\n<$B> \n\n But   \n\n\n It 's fine but it 's somewhat   unfair for us\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n\n  It 's a training  for you  ha  you know\n\n<$B> \n\n From only   \n\n\n  Yeah  \n\n<$A> \n\n When you   get to work you get to pin your I D\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah though   I hope that  all college would also be like that as ours\n\n<$A> \n\n More or less   yeah\n\n\nWell if for example all of the colleges will uhm would promote that kind of law would we have that kind of law uhm would you feel uhm that we are treated equally\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay and therefore uhm you feel you would therefore feel that uhm the I D policy will uhm it 's time for you to graduate\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nIs that right\n\n<$B> \n\nActually the I D policy is fine because during our high school days we pin our I Ds   always  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   I mean but you 're in college already\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah   but still  \n\n<$A> \n\n It 's the   major quote unquote highlight of your college life so that you don't have to pin your I D anymore   and  you don't have to wear your uniform or something\n\n<$B> \n\n Really   is that how you view college\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I don't\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy not\n\n\nOh how do you view college\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I viewed it more learnings and\n\n<$A> \n\nReally okay\n\n<$B> \n\nSomehow it 's somewhat part of  yung  the training that I need for me to go to work\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay by the way what kind of work are you planning to go to to work for\n\n<$B> \n\nI hope I could be involved in a company that would really produce softwares so I would be a programmer or an analyst or even a graphics designer\n\n\nIt depends, but I don't want to do work such as inputting datas only into the database\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so you don't like uhm secretarial type of job okay\n\n<$B> \n\n  I hope  \n\n<$A> \n\n Well I   when I graduate uhm, I don't like to work in in programming stuff\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy\n\n\n  And why did you find select  COMSCI  \n\n<$A> \n\n Well I don't find   \n\n\nWell as long as it 's something I find joy in\n\n<$B> \n\nReally\n\n<$A> \n\nDuring my high school years that is\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah right, \n\n\nLook Lilibeth Lilibeth is conscious  \n\n<$A> \n\nAnyway so how do you find the no eat the eating no eating policy uhm here in La Salle\n\n<$B> \n\nWell it 's, somehow a discipline for us though it 's also hard   because  \n\n<$A> \n\n Are you   in favor of it, or are you are you against it\n\n<$B> \n\nPartially yes and partially no\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay why\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause, for instance you want to eat and there are only specific places that you can eat right\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah   are you in favor of that  \n\n<$B> \n\n And if those   \n\n\nWait let me finish\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd if those places are already occupied then where are you going to eat right\n\n\nSo it 's somewhat it 's not really needed actually it 's just it just <unclear> 1 word </unclear> discipline but not littering\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so well uhm so in conclusion you are saying that uhm uhm you are not that uhm in favor with the policy right, \n\n<$B> \n\nOh in some sense yes\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay  well let me tell you how I feel what I feel\n\n\nI hate that no eating policy\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy\n\n<$A> \n\n Ha  \n\n<$B> \n\nWhy\n\n<$A> \n\n E  it 's no use you know\n\n<$B> \n\nHow come\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm  are you in favor that they are limiting uhm the places where you could eat are you in favor of that\n\n<$B> \n\nNo", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "29fcf913-62ef-4bdb-a46a-e8167477a9c5",

uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd uh I think it 's one way of expressing myself\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah that 's why your masteral 's in relation to that\n\n<$A> \n\nWell yeah sort of but uh you know I really want to pursue a kind of uh further studies in theater arts\n\n<$B> \n\nTheater arts\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I think that would be\n\n<$B> \n\nWho 'd be your characters what kind of play by the way is   that  \n\n<$A> \n\n Well   it 's uh a typical Augustinian presentation\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nWell\n\n<$B> \n\nYou do that every year\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah this is for for three years already for three years\n\n<$B> \n\nSame play\n\n<$A> \n\nNo different plays of course\n\n<$B> \n\nUh different play\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause the the play should suit the characters and at the same time it should really touch a kind of issue\n\n\nIt should discuss an issue about for example our issue this year is about friendship and community life\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah   I 've read it   \n\n<$A> \n\n That 's very Augustinian   \n\n<$B> \n\nWait\n\n<$A> \n\nOh there 's a telephone call you better answer that\n\n<$B> \n\nHello good morning, \n\n\nWho 's on the line  \n\n<$A> \n\nShe 's looking for whom\n\n<$B>

friend   \n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\n  It 's the first time  \n\n<$A> \n\n So yeah   this coming August twenty-eight we 'll have a presentation\n\n\nI think you have to invite some of your friends also so you 'll not feel bored\n\n<$B> \n\nI won't Sharon is here\n\n\nSo   why would I be bored  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah Sharon   also is coming together with her friends I think\n\n\nThat becomes a tradition already that uh every time we celebrate the feast of Saint Augustine we invite our friends from different schools and from  from other seminaries\n\n\nAnd we and it 's a kind of socialization you know  Augustinians very friendly\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah like you\n\n<$A> \n\n  Am I  \n\n<$B> \n\n You really   belong here\n\n<$A> \n\nAm I\n\n<$B> \n\nYou are  \n\n<$A> \n\nOh thank you\n\n\nDo you still notice I have colds\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n\nActually I 've noticed that two weeks ago  \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah well forget the colds\n\n\nI  I am very very happy that I am here although I 'm not feeling well\n\n\nI just wanna see you because uh because yesterday I wasn't able to to join you for lunch\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n\nWhere have you been where were you\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I was just very busy doing uh a very important work uh in my room\n\n\nThen suddenly I slept I rested for a while then when I woke up it 's already three o'clock\n\n<$B> \n\nYou skipped lunch\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah it 's time for prayer   when I woke up  \n\n<$B> \n\n You always do that   \n\n<$A> \n\nWell sometimes I forget to to take lunch because I 'm too busy\n\n\nBut anyway I 'm too fat I 'm big  \n\n\nAnd I don't think\n\n<$B> \n\nNo that 's not enough reason\n\n\nYour size is not enough reason for you to skip lunch\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know in an Augustinian community we really we really value meal time\n\n\nWe should be together we should be eating   uh together  in the in the refectory\n\n\nAnd every time I skip dinner lunch or breakfast my brothers would always ask me where have you been  ,  why did you not take your uh your dinner why did you not take your lunch  ,  I feel so guilty \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n Yeah   \n\n\n And as I  observe   ha  \n\n\nWhen you don't join   them  for lunch\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nBut sometimes I can't help it but uh just to sleep just to take a rest  kasi  \n\n\nBut  every time I do that I ask for an apology especially to my brothers  ,  who who kept on asking me about that\n\n\nWell that 's part of life \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nYeah like when you were when you didn't join us for lunch I when I see you in the afternoon I asked you why didn't you join us for lunch \n\n<$A> \n\nWell every Friday and Saturday I 'm out for school and they understand that   I  have   I have to  take my lunch   outside  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n I understand   \n\n\n Outside   \n\n<$A> \n\n E  La Salle is too far from San Agustin Center of Studies\n\n\nSo uh I take my lunch outside\n\n\nBut Mondays through uh Wednesday I see to it that uh   I  \n\n<$B> \n\n You   take your lunch here\n\n<$A> \n\nWell  I try I always try but you know my work\n\n<$B> \n\nSometimes you fail\n\n<$A> \n\nMost of the time\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd as I observe that as I was saying as I observe when someone is not there for a lunch they look for\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's because you know it 's part of our training that we should go together we should be together\n\n\nThat 's very Augustinian you know community life\n\n\nWe value community life and when somebody is absent of course the fathers always look for the   lost sheep  \n\n<$B> \n\n Lost sheep   uhm yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know as the Bible says  He 's looking for the lost sheep  \n\n\nAnd so after that Father Master would always ask the leader oh where is Willy oh where is Dante where where is uh uh so and so\n\n\nSo because  belong to the community\n\n\nAnd every time we take our lunch we take our dinner here yeah we talk we discuss anything we discuss issues\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n\nThe things that happened to you   the whole day  \n\n<$A> \n\n The whole day   yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nFray Will I can I ask you a question\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat did you really want to become when you were a kid\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen I was\n\n<$B> \n\nYou wanted to become a priest\n\n<$A> \n\nWell when I was still in the elementary my one of my teachers asked me what my dream\n\n\nAs I  as far as I remember I really wanted to be an economist\n\n\nI don't   know why  \n\n<$B> \n\n You love   numbers\n\n<$A> \n\nNot really numbers\n\n\nI don't know why it sounds so good \" economist \" \n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBut later on I realized that, I cannot really I couldn't be an economist\n\n\nThen later on during my high school days uh I wanted to be a doctor\n\n<$B> \n\nUh yeah  \n\n<$A> \n\nBut I 'm but I 'm not good in Science\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A> \n\nThen uh I also hate numbers so I don't wanna be an engineer\n\n\nBut later on I realized that I want to teach\n\n\nI want to be with people\n\n\nThen after high school   I  \n\n<$B> \n\n What   course did you finish by the way\n\n<$A> \n\nBachelor of Education I graduated from the Philippine Normal University\n\n<$B> \n\n  Uh that 's good  \n\n<$A> \n\n Then   I taught for three years\n\n\nAfter before entering the seminary I taught for three years\n\n<$B> \n\nWhere\n\n<$A> \n\nIn Montessori de Manila in Para&ntilde;aque\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A> \n\nThen I really enjoyed teaching\n\n\nThen it was the time that I met my co-teachers who were seminarians before\n\n\nThen they invited me for a retreat for seminars symposia about religious life\n\n\nThen\n\n<$B> \n\nSeminarians of Saint Augustine\n\n<$A> \n\nNo uh S V Ds they were my former my former co-teachers in Montessori\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nThen they left the seminary and then it was the time that they invited me to   to join  the same congregation \n\n<$B> \n\n To join   \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A> \n\nThen after that I felt that there was really a calling\n\n\nThen the rest is history\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nIt seems that you 're interested about   my  my my vocation \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah I am   I am\n\n<$A> \n\nWell\n\n<$B> \n\nI am interested\n\n<$A> \n\nIt started there uh I felt that uh God is calling me for a very special purpose\n\n\nThen I enjoyed uh attending seminars about religious life\n\n\nI started reading the Bible and started uh examining myself\n\n\nI involved myself with contemplation\n\n\nThen after that I left my work I asked my superior I wanna enter the seminary then the rest is history as I said\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah so you you entered seminary three years after you graduated from college\n\n<$A> \n\nYes I worked for three years in Montessori de Manila\n\n\nIt was so compensating I really enjoyed my work\n\n\nI was able to meet different kinds of people and up to now they still uh we still have an open communication with my former co-teachers and administrators\n\n\nAnd <unclear> words </unclear> of me\n\n\nBut of course God has greater plans for me\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's why\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah that 's why I opted to be a priest\n\n\nWell it 's not an option but a kind of calling it 's a kind of vocation that I can't really resist\n\n<$B> \n\nThere was one time that you told me you missed kids like\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's why every time my my formators ask me oh Willy would you like to teach yeah I always see to it that I accept the offer because I really miss kids\n\n\nOne time we were at Bi&ntilde;an\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah yeah yeah that   was what  I was about to say\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh yeah

\n\nYou were still in New Guinea\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah in Papua New Guinea\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$B>  \n\nI was still in high school\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah you know that was really so much fun 'cause that was the first time I was actually ever out of the country\n\n<$B>  \n\nOkay\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah I mean you 've been like to several countries already\n\n<$B>  \n\nWell I think it 's you 'll get to appreciate 'cause you 've left the country when you 're older\n\n<$A>  \n\nWhat do you mean\n\n<$B>  \n\nLike 'cause I left the first time I got uhm Papua New Guinea was where I was born right\n\n\nI was still a kid and I didn't really remember the memories I wasn't really excited\n\n\nBut I still I I remember the time when I left the country by myself coming to the Philippines it 's more exciting\n\n<$A>  \n\nOh\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah I understand  na parang  I I I understand like, you grew up you feel liberated there\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah 'cause like 'cause like you know that was really the first time I left the country and that was the first time I was in a plane also    so  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Uh    \n\n<$A>  \n\nAnd you know how it is\n\n\nPeople say PAL  the service isn't that great the planes are kinda old the pilots are like you know  nyak  \n\n<$B>  \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A>  \n\nSo I remember when I told the guys in debating team David my teammates David and and Iba    ,   I was telling them guys you know this is the first time I 'm gonna leave the country this is the first time I 'm gonna be in a plane \n\n\nWhat this is the first time you 're actually leaving the country \n\n\nYeah yeah yeah \n\n\nSo it was we were all there and you know on on the plane we were all seated down and then at that point I was asking okay so what happens now oh we 're gonna out we 're gonna do this and that okay \n\n\nAnd when the plane started right remember when the plane first started you start hearing these weird sounds    rattling  and dripping and so I started sweating\n\n\nI was getting really getting nervous and they 're still ribbing me uh the plane 's gonna blow up the plane 's gonna blow up oh I never heard that sound before\n\n\nI say what I said stop it stop it stop it leave me alone \n\n\nGosh I was really scared\n\n\nBut once what and then that part I 'm sure you 'd agree with me that the worst part when you 're on a plane is just the exact moment when it leaves the ground\n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Yeah    \n\n\n\n Yeah    \n\n\nYeah you you 're your stomach, goes topsy-turvy\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah yeah it 's like as if you know you 're like fifty feet in the air but your stomach is still at ground zero\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$A>  \n\nGosh\n\n<$B>  \n\nYou feel like throwing up, also when your ears pound\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$B>  \n\nIt was weird\n\n<$A>  \n\nSo how was your first tournament like\n\n<$B>  \n\nMy first tournament\n\n\nTrip to Bangkok\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$B>  \n\nMy first yeah it was really exciting\n\n\nI really wanted to go to Bangkok I 've never been to Thailand\n\n<$A>  \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B>  \n\nSo I was really looking forward to it\n\n\nAnd it while on the plane it was it was pretty uh a fairly short trip\n\n\nAnd landing in Bangkok was, was uhm, \n\n<$A>  \n\nFreaky\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah freaky\n\n\nIt was like you 're landing in midnight and you 're really hungry 'cause the plane food wasn't that really good\n\n<$A>  \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B>  \n\nAnd Bangkok is pretty similar to the Philippines, in Manila similar to Manila\n\n\nAnd I really enjoyed debating there the debating experience the debating side\n\n<$A>  \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B>  \n\nIt was very, competitive and very worthwhile debating for C S B  and the experience was really unforgettable\n\n<$A>  \n\nAnd then considering you guys were all rookies right\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah not that much training\n\n\nOur team was a rookie team\n\n\nAlso your team was a rookie team right\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah we were we were a rookie team but we still had like several weeks of practice training and you know way back then I was hanging out with the people who are the great ones today Nikki Bombit\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$A>  \n\nCaloy\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$A>  \n\nR J Ledesma\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah the great debaters\n\n<$A>  \n\nOf course the the problem in that is that you know whenever I meet someone you know you 've seen me when people say oh you 're Jack right I remember you from ninety-four in the First All-Asians\n\n\nAnd then all of a sudden there 's this meta-comparison of R J then R J now Bombit then Bombit now\n\n\nIt was like me    \n\n<$B>  \n\nIt 's me still    the same  \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Yup    still me me\n\n\nI really hate that when that happens though\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$A>  \n\nOf course I never did debate for  weren't I keep on telling you I never debated for the competition it was always for fun\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$A>  \n\nI didn't care if I lost\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah my main reason for debating is to go abroad just to visit countries and discover new cultures\n\n<$A>  \n\nCheck out the chicks\n\n<$B>  \n\nCheck out the girls uh taste the food, and, probably inspire you to travel later in life when I work, and to build up my independence\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah it 's such a nice feeling right when you 're you know you 're there your parents aren't around you gotta take care of yourself\n\n<$B>  \n\nOf course\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$B>  \n\nIt 's like you 're working already and you 're traveling all around the world\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$B>  \n\nYou have to budget your money, and buy food\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah it 's like I remember in Singapore we had to  we had to subsist on these two dollar rice meals 'cause we were staying in school okay\n\n\nAnd naturally the registration fee didn't cover all the meals they just pretty much covered breakfast and a few dinners you know cultural night  break-in  night or whatever\n\n\nSo most of the time during lunch we 'd have to buy our own food\n\n\nAnd since it 's it 's summer there you know summer the cafeteria really wasn't the school cafeteria wasn't open just the small stalls you know just small place where they sell whatever, \n\n\nAnd you know while we were there we had to pick our food because there are only so many so many choices and some of the choices were really expensive\n\n\nIt 's like you know it costs what, it costs like about four or five Singapore dollars to one American dollar and food there costs two dollars three dollars\n\n\nSo you know in here I wasn't on a low budget I was going around like oh man I am hungry I wanna eat \n\n\nLike ten bucks  twenty bucks uhm okay I think I 'll wait for the free dinner later  just go back for seconds\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah like like my  trip in Bangkok\n\n\nHow I saved money so I 'cause like breakfast is really everyday right    ,   so I would eat a very heavy breakfast\n\n\nIt 'd probably last me until the night\n\n\nSo during the night I would probably eat a small snack and uhm keep you know keep me full for the rest of the day\n\n\nSave save my money and spend my money on more clothes 'cause clothes are really cheap in Bangkok, \n\n\nBut the food in Bangkok is really delicious it 's different from Filipino food\n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Uh uhm    \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B>  \n\nMore spicy more fresh fresher vegetables and fish\n\n\nIt 's pretty cheap compared to Filipino food I mean quantity wise\n\n<$A>  \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B>  \n\nIt 's more cheaper, \n\n<$A>  \n\nOkay, yeah in in Singapore I didn't get the chance to do much shopping stuff there 's so expensive\n\n\nBut I I thought something really funny 'cause when we were there walking around there was one night a bunch of us were just you know walking around checking the city\n\n\nSingapore 's a very small city so you just you can make the what 's the main road\n\n\nOrchard\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah yeah Orchard Road\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah Orchard where the shops were\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$A>  \n\nI was so surprised when we were walking down \" Now Showing Lion King \" \n\n\nAnd I remembered Lion King had already shown here around one or two years ago\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$A>  \n\nI was like hey this is great the Philippines is actually first when it comes to movies \n\n\nYou know something to feel proud about\n\n\nI don't know it 's a very small thing but you know yeah I watched that ahead of everyone else\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah if I was in the situation I 'd probably feel proud too  \n\n\nYou 've got the upper hand with the Singaporeans\n\n\nSingaporeans are out of date  \n\n<$A>  \n\nBy one or two years\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah it 's a big thing\n\n<$A>  \n\nAnd it 's because we 're better at getting pirated stuff\n\n<$B>  \n\nI know\n\n\nSingapore 's really strict in    piracy  \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Yeah    \n\n<$B>  \n\nIn piracy\n\n<$A>  \n\nAnd the people there are so weird    'cause like  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Why    \n\n<$A>  \n\nRight in Singapore you can't bring chewing gum\n\n\nWhen you smoke you can't just throw the butts anywhere\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$A>  \n\nI remember my teammates when they 'd smoke they have to carry the butts in their pocket until they find a trash can and throw it out\n\n\nBut and so I kinda figured that Singapore 's really strict\n\n\nAnd when I got there I was kinda scared 'cause I think the caning incident already happened already in Singapore\n\n<$B>  \n\nMichael Fay\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah Michael Fay\n\n\nIt already happened so Joel was like  Uy  don't get Michael Fayed don't get Michael Fayed \n\n\nSo okay fine\n\n\nAnd so when we were walking around hey how about some gum you know we were ribbing each other\n\n\nThere was one time we took their their their their train the M R T whatever it 's called\n\n\nAnd naturally there were signs there saying \" No Smoking No Gum No Littering \" whatever\n\n\nAnd the people there were so serious not they 're just like sitting there straight-faced workers students they were all so serious\n\n\nYou know I was like joking my friends we should we should put a sign there \" No Laughing Fine Five Hundred Singaporean Dollars \" \n\n\nNo really so so there I was expecting these people to be really so stuck-up and you know tight-assed and whatever\n\n\nAnd come the evening so since you know it 's the evening already so okay debaters you know debaters all party people we went to Hard Rock and I was so surprised\n\n\nThe same geeky nerdy people you see debating and talking so intellectually with glasses and Ivy League haircuts you see these are the same people jumping up and down on the dance floor doing the  macarena  doing the  lambada  \n\n\nYou know drinking you know  tequila  shots like it 's water something like\n\n\nGosh talk of your first  vampires  man, weird\n\n<$B>  \n\nSingaporeans, yeah I find them pretty weird\n\n<$A>  \n\nHow about people in Thailand what were they like\n\n<$B>  \n\nPeople in Thailand were very kind\n\n\nThey were also outgoing in parties\n\n\nThey 're very  hospitable and they they like to laugh and joke around\n\n\nIt 's similar to the Filipino culture\n\n<$A>  \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B>  \n\nThe only problem with the Thai people were they were not really fluent in English as we are in communicating, \n\n\nI have some fond memories of them\n\n\nThey were very accommodating\n\n\nIt was like it was like my fellow brothers in the Philippines my fellow      my fellow friends in the Philippines\n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Yeah I have also some fond memories of Thai people\n\n\nI told you the story right\n\n<$B>  \n\nOh yeah\n\n<$A>  \n\nDarn  \n\n\nThat was really weird one you know\n\n\nAnd the funny thing is years and years after that I still just sit down some place and think about it\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$A>  \n\nWhat would have happened if  if I had gone on ahead and see what would have happened\n\n\nHow different would my life be today if if I had let one night\n\n<$B>  \n\nThat 's destiny or fate\n\n\nHow will you how will you classify destiny or fate\n\n<$A>  \n\nStupidity\n\n<$B>  \n\nStupidity  \n\n<$A>  \n\nI don't know I guess destiny\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah it 's destiny\n\n\nIt 's destined to happen\n\n<$A>

in those magazines are very, very   what  \n\n<$A> \n\n Normal   \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah in a way but not all and maybe\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know\n\n\nI guess I 'm still coming from the  gestalt  I have in reading the \" Republic \" I mean in the \" Republic \" in the have you read the \" Republic \" Plato 's \" Republic \" \n\n<$B> \n\nSome part not all\n\n<$A> \n\nIn Plato 's \" Republic \" Plato actually chastises Homer Plato or Socrates or Plato he chastises Homer\n\n\nIt 's about saying that Homer teaches the wrong stuff to the Greeks and that 's why they have a sucky state\n\n\nIt 's just like saying why our people are afraid of dying it 's because Homer and some of his contemporaries portrayed death as something bad\n\n\nLike when you die you go to Hades and all this shit happens to you\n\n\nSo if I was a warrior if it was my job to defend the republic the state so why would I throw my life away if dying would be so bad\n\n\nWhere 's the   look at it\n\n<$B> \n\n'Cause for some there 's glory in dying for your country\n\n<$A> \n\nBut that that 's Plato 's point\n\n\nThat 's not common because the one that they 're exposed to sensitizes their mind for that particular  gestalt  \n\n\n  In their  minds dying is bad meaning it 's not it 's not even if you die a glorious death battle this is\n\n\nRemember we 're talking about the Greeks we 're not talking about \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Norse\n\n\nWe 're not   even talking  about Christians\n\n<$B> \n\n Okay   \n\n<$A> \n\nWe 're talking about a  gestalt  in which when you die you go to hell or rather to Hades\n\n\nAnd   when  you 're there nothing 's fun there\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$A> \n\nI mean look at Greek, the Greek cosmology\n\n\nAm I correct with that one yeah the Greek\n\n<$B> \n\nBut why do they portray Hades as a place wherein there are two divisions\n\n\nWell   that 's  according to the Hercules movies the   Starworld  movies\n\n<$A> \n\n Homer   \n\n\n Don't   don't base it on that\n\n<$B> \n\nWell well according to that well according to that there 's these two divisions\n\n\nOne is if you die a normal cause or if you did something good in your life you 'll be in, in a place like paradise\n\n<$A> \n\nThis is Hercules  \n\n<$B> \n\nHercules journey\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Disney Hercules\n\n<$B> \n\nNo Hercules the series Starworld Asia\n\n<$A> \n\nOf course they 're going to show that\n\n\nIt 's called mass media appeal\n\n<$B> \n\nNo that 's what that 's the problem nowadays in mass media\n\n<$A> \n\nLike this one\n\n\nI guess the reason why I said Plato 's \" Republic \" and all others\n\n\nIt 's more like this\n\n\nI mean or maybe I 'm just too much the guardian\n\n\nBut anyway like like I said a while ago life is more than just sex\n\n\nIt 's more than just getting an orgy  more than just\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I agree with that\n\n<$A> \n\nYes but\n\n<$B> \n\nLife is more than sex\n\n\nLife is more than life is more than life itself\n\n<$A> \n\nBut Gail you are one of the leaders you 're conditioned for doing stuff that 's more than this\n\n\n  Yes you may  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   but still I 'm a female and I well\n\n<$A> \n\nYes but what I 'm saying is\n\n<$B> \n\nBut you see this is a we live in a  machoist  society  \n\n\nThere are speakin' there are spoken rules regulation on our society that females  ,  should abide to \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean why do women wear high stiletto heels\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you have to abide by them, \n\n<$B> \n\nWell if you were if you 're a flight stewardess you 're expected to be beautiful to be glamorous to wear red lipsticks and brown eyeshadows peach blush-ons and everything the whole stuff\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm the way that women weren't were expected to not vote and not hold say positions such as lawyers politicians and, \n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI guess what I 'm just trying to say is uh the reason why I can understand stuff like this like Cosmopolitan magazine heck they they provide jobs don't they\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah they do\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know I   guess  \n\n<$B> \n\n They 'll   also show you where where the best where you can buy things at the lowest price\n\n<$A> \n\nI guess that was just something   like  \n\n<$B> \n\n And   \n\n<$A> \n\nI mean I guess if it was just about a question of trends I mean this is good\n\n\nI mean stuff like this it probably chalk it up to dialectics where when thesis and anti-thesis meet in order to come up with a synthesis where I don't know\n\n\nMaybe I 'm just too much ivory tower coming from where I came from  \n\n\nYou know how the Atenean thinks sometimes\n\n\nWhat about if Atenean girls read the same things\n\n\nHahaha    I think  \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$A> \n\n  Right  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   some even read   what  Y M \n\n<$A> \n\n I guess   \n\n\nI guess I get your point about the thing\n\n<$B> \n\nDon't tell me you haven't read the male magazines\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I haven't\n\n<$B> \n\nOh come on\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'm a Catholic youth leader how   dare you  \n\n<$B> \n\n Hello   \n\n<$A> \n\nYes I haven't\n\n<$B> \n\nReally\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah   I find  them repugnant, \n\n<$B> \n\n Ows   okay\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean have you seen any of those male magazines\n\n\nUh no no no we 're not talking about Playboy we 're talking about the male variant\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat   F Y M  \n\n<$A> \n\n Are we talking about   \n\n<$B> \n\nEverything   Playboy the  \n\n<$A> \n\n If we 're talking about  Playboy   those other stuffs they  \n\n<$B> \n\n The F Y M the   what\n\n<$A> \n\nI find them repugnant\n\n\nHave you seen any of the pictures in those magazines\n\n\nI 've seen the pictures and they no not suck suck \" suck \" is such a bad term to use right now in that context  \n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'm not ignorant  \n\n<$B> \n\nOh okay\n\n<$A> \n\nYes if you could insert kissing sounds here  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah right yeah right\n\n<$A> \n\nYes Gail why are you going the other way  \n\n\nGail don't go there , \n\n\nAnyway uhm I guess I 'm just angry at  at the thought that most people\n\n\nSometimes you tend to believe what the leftists say about current society because of the stuff you see like the media and even the church tries to keep people 's minds down so they don't rise up against the bourgeois  \n\n<$B> \n\nLike what the traditional politicians say right now\n\n<$A> \n\nNot exactly  like the  trapos   more like well like this instead of teaching people to reach beyond mere animal stuff it 's actually trying to emphasize\n\n\nYou 're sleepy\n\n<$B> \n\nNo not\n\n<$A> \n\nYou 're just tired uhm, the baby is tired\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I 'm not   hello I 'm not  a baby anymore\n\n<$A> \n\n    \n\n\nYes you 're twenty-one\n\n\nAnyway where were we\n\n\nYeah something like that\n\n\nIt 's, I don't know\n\n\nI guess it 's my upbringing I mean my upbringing was more like teaching me that I 'm this that I 'm I can be more than what most people are  \n\n\nYeah I was brought up to believe in that and in the inherent good within humanity in the potential for humanity\n\n\nSo I guess seeing stuff like this trying to keep you in the animal level it 's just like it 's just sad\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's what Plato was trying to say in his \" Republic \" \n\n\nIt 's that 's part of what he was trying to say like it should be that education education should be about trying to teach people to reach their highest potential\n\n\nNot just give them all the shit of data and that 's it\n\n\nOr just trying to make them run through a system wherein they 're just trying to develop people in order to perpetuate the system\n\n\nWe call them  Shicogen  in among sci-fi buffs\n\n\n Shicogens  salary men\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nWage slaves\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nPeople who are slaves of the Bundy  putring   \n\n<$B> \n\nUh okay,   okay  \n\n<$A> \n\n I mean   how many graduates can honestly chart their own course\n\n\nI mean I I guess I 'm lucky I 'm an Atenean I mean heck I haven't I sometimes I have the right to choose my own job  \n\n\nBut how many people can do that\n\n\nI mean how many people when they graduate just have to take this job because it 's the one being offered\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy is it like that\n\n\nWhy is the educational system like that\n\n\nIf you graduate from a reputable and known school you easily you can easily get jobs", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2be38da5-ed1b-47fa-a9f7-ffa582126775", "added":

chose some of his  kwan  his close friends Cebuanos so political law\n\n<$D> \n\nI well I don't know I don't really care\n\n<$C> \n\nSo we have guesses like rumors  na naman  and you rely on rumors\n\n\nUsually some of these rumors are really true\n\n\nLike last year I know that they anticipated it that Pascual   will be the examiner  for labor\n\n<$D> \n\n Yes yes   \n\n<$C> \n\nSo a lot of people really prepared for that exam\n\n<$D> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\n'Cause he 's very exacting  e  \n\n\nHe wants you to to phrase it phrase the law accurately and he has his own way he has his buzz words\n\n\n  If you don't write down  \n\n<$B> \n\n What 's buzz words   \n\n<$C> \n\nWords that he thinks are important\n\n<$B> \n\nAhhh\n\n<$C> \n\nThings are you know which, you give it a specific meaning\n\n\nSo he wants those buzz words so they had to study his book and he was really the examiner\n\n<$B> \n\nThese people are they have they become your teachers before\n\n<$C> \n\nPascual was my teacher\n\n<$D> \n\nHe teaches in U P so uh\n\n<$C> \n\nSome of them like our senior partner\n\n<$D> \n\nWhat\n\n<$C> \n\nRene Cayetano was the examiner\n\n<$D> \n\nRene Cayetano the   senior partner of this firm  yeah in nineteen eighty-nine\n\n<$C> \n\nLabor also\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$D> \n\nLabor\n\n<$B> \n\nEighty-nine\n\n<$D> \n\nNineteen eighty-nine\n\n<$C> \n\nMost of them didn't know even Pia because Pia is my batchmate or classmate\n\n\n  She 's the daughter  of Rene\n\n<$D> \n\n His daughter   \n\n<$C> \n\nAnd before the nineteen eighty-  nine  bar exams there were rumors that he was the bar examiner but Pia was saying of course not if he was the bar examiner I 'm good at I should know this is my Dad he didn't tell us <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nUhm do you think that like you need  parang  you need to devote like a part of the test to psychological exams also  parang  just to  parang  you know to know if  \n\n<$C> \n\nIf you don't have the right frame of mind if you 're\n\n<$B> \n\nYou won't do it\n\n<$C> \n\nYou you can't you can't do well in that exam you it requires a lot of mental   ano 'yon  mental well-being  e  just to survive that exam\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd there <unclear> words </unclear> perhaps also\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah\n\n<$D> \n\nThe tension and the   pressure  create the psychological tensions that uh normally\n\n<$C> \n\n Pressure   \n\n\nBreak anybody   who 's not  \n\n<$D> \n\n Yeah yeah   they would  yes of course and   of course  \n\n<$C> \n\n And there were   cases right\n\n<$D> \n\nYes people cracked after the\n\n<$B> \n\nUh yeah\n\n<$D> \n\nDuring the exam itself\n\n\nThey break down and cry\n\n<$C> \n\nOr they drink ink\n\n<$D> \n\nOr they   scream  \n\n<$B> \n\n Oh     you 're kidding  \n\n<$C> \n\n Yeah   there are some girls <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$D> \n\n  No uh  \n\n<$B> \n\n During your   exam\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah during our exam\n\n<$D> \n\nWhat do I didn't know anything about that\n\n\nI remember about the   girl  who  ano  who had to be carried out in a stretcher\n\n<$C> \n\n Well   \n\n\nUh no I didn't know about that but I knew about the girl who drank the ink because my classmate was her roommate\n\n<$D> \n\nUh\n\n<$C> \n\nWe were so <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$D> \n\nOh many of those every year anyway uh law school should be the primary meeting of uh <unclear> word </unclear> like we start out in Ateneo we start out with five classes we only graduate two, \n\n\nSo there there you should already get the   the  wackos out\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$D> \n\nBut seeing if you look at many practitioners  na  you see plenty of weirdoes walking around also that means that, uh the practice of law and schizophrenia are not necessarily incompatible  'no   \n\n<$C> \n\nIn fact when I when I was in my freshman year, we had this batchmate turned out to be a wacko, she turned out to be insane\n\n\nAt first we but she 's very intelligent    e  and she  writes really good in in poems\n\n<$D> \n\n Uh uhm yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\nPoems\n\n<$C> \n\nIt turned out we thought she was just weird she was just an artist\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah  parang  eccentric\n\n<$C> \n\nUntil she started fantasizing about burning a classmate   or  saying that she was the wife of a certain person\n\n\nAnd then she 's being pursued by  the New People 's Army and the Yellow Army and what was this the clincher was that she was the daughter of Jackie Onassis \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$D> \n\nUh\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah that was the clincher\n\n\nShe would stay out in the rain and then  oy   Chari  come in you 're going to be you 're going to get sick  sabi niya  no I 'm used to the cold I was born in Connecticut and my mother was Jackie Onassis until Cory Aquino kidnapped me and brought me to this damned wretched place  ganon  \n\n\nBut when they found out she was you know mentally off-balanced\n\n\nIt was really true  ha  \n\n\nShe passed the entrance exam she passed the interview with flying colors and she turned out to be\n\n<$D> \n\nDid they ask her to leave\n\n<$C> \n\nThey did\n\n<$D> \n\nUh I see\n\n\nBecause you 'll pass the bar even if you 're crazy as long as you autistic people can take that bar and pass it, and then uh well whether uh whether he is qualified to be a lawyer or not later on, is decided by what either the clients who choose him or\n\n<$C> \n\nFirm that he works for\n\n<$D> \n\nYeah people who would like to commit him later on <unclear> word </unclear> crazy that bar exam is not going to indicate, your psychological world view\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm, uhm, Joyce you wanna choose a question\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm okay\n\n\nIt says that quality of preparation you underwent do you think that having been educated in an elite and  di ba yung  elite institution gave you an edge over other like other aspirants\n\n<$C> \n\nThat 's what I thought the bar exam, it was an equalizer some sort 'cause nothing  ewan ko  feeling  nga  nothing ever prepares you for the bar exams  e  \n\n\n Kasi  it 's not it 's not the usual  di ba yung  the technique what do you call that in teaching that you have one professor and then you learn from him    parang   \n\n<$D> \n\n Socratic   method\n\n<$C> \n\nNo no it 's the,    query query  \n\n\nWhat do you call that\n\n<$B> \n\n \n\n<$D> \n\nPedagogic\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah pedagogic method  na  you  parang  you share the same universe  di ba  that there 's one teacher the teaching is not it 's not that way  e di ba  \n\n\nIt 's this outside you 're a stranger who didn't teach you anything who 's going to choose the question\n\n\nNow your his universe is different from yours, like you may be  have been taught different things like in U P  kasi , I 've noticed, we were taught the  kwan e  complex questions  yung , each question must you must you must analyze it because it 's not as easy as it seems  na parang  you don't trust a simple question  ganon na  you always think no there is a trick in this \n\n\n Kaya  during the bar exam I was I was also thinking  ganoon  no this question is too easy there must be a catch  ganyan ganyan 'yun pala , it was just it was just   simple  \n\n<$B> \n\n Simple   \n\n<$C> \n\nJust asking me uh you know a fundamental question but I answered in a complex way\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm \n\n<$C> \n\nSo you see the training is different and the emphasis is different\n\n\nSo that 's the,   that 's the problem  \n\n<$B> \n\n Did you you have   to do some adjustment then   when you  get there\n\n<$C> \n\n Yes   yes\n\n<$D> \n\n Well I thought that uh, going to my school was worth the trouble and the expense because no the bar exam is a measure of basic knowledge they 're not supposed to measure uh unusual or obscure uh questions of law\n\n\nNow that basic knowledge is something like a common universe all lawyers must share see if you don't know that then you should not become a lawyer\n\n\n  That 's the  whole logic of the bar exam\n\n<$C> \n\n Yeah but   is the writ of Amparo\n\n<$D> \n\nWell there   so you have isolated  you have isolated exceptions to the rule\n\n<$C> \n\n Common universe   \n\n<$D> \n\nBut as a general rule the bar exam is only supposed to ask you uh to measure a minimum threshold of knowledge  ,  which you must possess in order to be qualified to serve as a lawyer\n\n\nNow there are only how many months before the bar exam \n\n<$C> \n\n That 's the ideal   \n\n\nSix months\n\n<$D> \n\nSix months\n\n\nIt 's impossible for you to go through everything that you 've read during the four years that you uh went to law school\n\n\nBut conceivably they can ask you anything about what you learned during those four years\n\n\nAnd if your school was not very good, then that review would be all that you would   basically you have to  rely on\n\n<$C> \n\n You have to rely on   \n\n<$D> \n\nI I I recall that, as you know my preparation was spotty \n\n I did not devote one hundred percent of my time to the study studying for the bar because I was also busy engaged in other activities like uh physical training\n\n\nSo I noticed that when I was taking the exam already I knew the answer to the question not because I had read it during the the months prior   immediately  uh preceding the bar exam\n\n<$B> \n\n Immediately   \n\n<$D> \n\nWell I still remember what my professor told me during the four years during some obscure day when I was sitting in his classroom\n\n\nAnd I think that is a crucial  they consisted the bulk of my answers they call what they call stock knowledge, I 'm sure you noticed that also\n\n<$C> \n\nI did\n\n<$D> \n\nDid you\n\n<$C> \n\nYes I did but, \n\n<$D> \n\nStuff that   you did not use  \n\n<$C> \n\n I think the question   well my personal opinion is, that the questions some some of the subjects the examiners were not able to phrase the question   correctly  okay   accurately  \n\n<$D> \n\n Uh well   \n\n\n Also true   \n\n<$C> \n\nIt 's so hard to to know what is he   asking for I don't understand  he 's asking\n\n<$D> \n\n What exactly that he wants   \n\n\nThat is a common\n\n<$C> \n\nThat 's the difference and I really felt because of the ambiguity in the question I was having a hard time, trying to  to figure out what he was asking for so\n\n\nI was always in because I was trained in U P I was always I would always think that he would was asking a hard question   and he wants me to analyze  \n\n<$B> \n\n Can you ask the proctor   \n\n<$D> \n\n  No you can't  \n\n<$C> \n\n No you can't   \n\n<$B> \n\nYou can't\n\n<$C> \n\nBecause the proctor does not know\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$C> \n\nHe does not know yeah\n\n<$D> \n\nYeah\n\n<$C> \n\nHe 's just like personnel in the Supreme Court\n\n<$D> \n\nHe probably doesn't know the answer and he doesn't understand the question he understands it even less\n\n<$C> \n\nSo unlike Uzoy I I really think that the bar exam is an it 's an equalizer but but of course we have an edge okay in the sense that we have been trained better because there are a lot of law schools you could see a lot of people from the provinces\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd I remember in my in my one in my room there were people who took the exams three times already and they   were  comparing the paper\n\n<$D> \n\n Yeah", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

from wedding\n\n<$A> \n\nThere are women who would go old instead of sleeping their\nway\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$C> \n\n  Yeah it is possible  \n\n<$A> \n\n Because   because\n\n<$B> \n\nIf you put it that way it makes sense\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\n'Cause I couldn't imagine  Pepe  uhm trying to get his\nway with a girl before they get married\n\n\nI don't think it   came from him  the idea of going to\nbed with her\n\n<$C> \n\n Look at this   \n\n\nBut as you said he was given a house by the family\n\n<$A> \n\nWho\n\n<$B> \n\nBy the girl 's family\n\n<$C> \n\nHe just said\n\n\nThe girl 's   family gave him a house  \n\n<$B> \n\n By the girl 's family   \n\n<$C> \n\nYeah\n\n\n Di ba  you said he was given a house  \n\n<$A> \n\nProbably not me\n\n\nMy sister\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah yeah yeah it was <unclear> word </unclear> yeah\n\n\nSee what,   that 's a good uhm  \n\n<$A> \n\n The reason why   \n\n<$B> \n\nIncentive\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah exactly  di ba  \n\n<$B> \n\nTo procreate\n\n<$C> \n\nYou know nowadays or gay nowadays\n\n<$A> \n\nBut now   other women have beliefs  \n\n<$B> \n\n And gay men   \n\n<$C> \n\n Ha  \n\n<$A> \n\nHave such the same belief as others going to bed with men\nbefore engaging in the sanctity of marriage simply because they want to know\nif they 're sexually compatible\n\n\nRight\n\n\nWrong\n\n<$C> \n\nBut that 's not the case with this couple\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nI think he just wanted to be\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd generally speaking\n\n<$C> \n\n Oo  \n\n<$B> \n\nCan you run that by me again\n\n\n Ano 'yon ano 'yon  \n\n<$A> \n\nAgain again   again  \n\n<$B> \n\n Again   again okay  \n\n<$A> \n\nNot a lot of women although how how the world corrupts your\nmind\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nNot a lot of women would go to the extent of going to bed\nwith men before getting into marriage the sanctity of marriage simply because\n\n<$B> \n\nThey want to know if   they 're sexually  \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n Society yeah   society dictates it and because\nthey want to know if they 're sexually   compatible or whatever  \n\n<$C> \n\n But because   but because\n\n<$A> \n\nThere are other there are other women I know that have still\nkept and believe in the\n\n<$C> \n\nSanctity\n\n<$A> \n\nSanctity of marriage and you know maintain your self pure and\nwhat have you\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBefore you enter into something like that y'know what I mean\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah but as you said  nga  some women like to\ncheck their sexual compatibility\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't get it I,   but I don't get it  \n\n<$C> \n\n I guess for   them it 's a lifetime\n\n<$A> \n\n  Commitment  \n\n<$C> \n\n Commitment   so since they 'll be doing that the\nrest of their lives\n\n\nTo each his own\n\n<$A> \n\nWell yeah well I respect the idea of others it bothers me\n\n<$C> \n\nBut in this case this girl really wants to get pregnant  \n\n by him  because\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nI think for Filipinos most of the time that 's the reason why they\ngo to bed with a guy\n\n<$C> \n\nTo hook the man\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah not to try out if they 're compatible\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\nWell speaking   from our generation  \n\n<$A> \n\n Really   \n\n<$C> \n\nFrom our generation I guess\n\n<$B> \n\n Oo nga   \n\n<$C> \n\nWe 're way\n\n<$B> \n\nI was just about to say that\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nReally\n\n<$B> \n\nI can't speak for the other girls   the younger ones\n\n \n\n<$C> \n\n Exactly   \n\n<$B> \n\nI   can't  \n\n<$C> \n\n  Oo   nga  \n\n<$A> \n\nBut I mean but you see it even now younger girls sleep at\navery early age\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nExactly just like someone who 's twelve years younger than me\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd proud of it\n\n<$B> \n\n Oo nga  \n\n<$C> \n\nWell she even said good luck to you\n\n<$B> \n\nUh yeah   yeah  \n\n<$C> \n\n In front   of all the men, \n\n<$A> \n\nLike saying hey paint the town red\n\n<$C> \n\nExactly\n\n\nAnd she even said it 's good I already did it\n\n<$A> \n\n  She did what  \n\n<$C> \n\n She made it look   as if I was so pathetic\n\n\nI was explaining that I I 'm happy the way I am\n\n\n  I   I 'm happy with my choice\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   uh uhm uh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd then suddenly she   just  \n\n<$A> \n\n It 's a choice you make   \n\n<$C> \n\nExactly\n\n\nAnd then suddenly she just whispered loudly whispered   \nloudly  \n\n<$B> \n\n Loudly   \n\n<$C> \n\nYeah she really really made sure I would hear her and say it 's\ngood I already did it\n\n<$A> \n\nHello\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah  parang  \n\n<$A> \n\nTo each his own\n\n<$C> \n\nExactly it 's sad\n\n\nThey they find me pathetic\n\n<$A> \n\nShe 's pathetic because you 're not those are things you 're\nnot even supposed to talk it out with\n\n\nWell   it depends on the kind of approach  \n\n<$C> \n\n That 's our point of view   that 's our point of\nview\n\n\nTo them it 's just like\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd you know the thing is about sex\n\n\nI think, if you just tried it once twice even up to ten times\nyou 're not in the position to say if it 's really good or not\n\n\nI think it you should have tried it at least uhm,  basta\n\n more than twenty   times uh  \n\n<$C> \n\n A regular   regular\n\n<$B> \n\nOr on a regular basis to know if it 's really enjoyable or\nnot\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I but I think the way I see things  kasi  \nI agree with you but then the way I see it it 's I think supposed to be\nenjoyable when you do it with someone you love   with someone you  \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$A> \n\n  You <unclear> word </unclear>  \n\n<$C> \n\n That 's how we were taught   that 's how we were\ntaught\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nTo be with for the rest of your life\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm uh uhm  pero  \n\n<$A> \n\nThat may sound very conservative but that 's\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah no no  tama 'yon  \n\n\n Kaya lang  for someone someone like her I don't\nthink she 's done it too many times   unless  she really sleeps\naround\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n  Exactly  \n\n<$B> \n\n But I doubt it   \n\n\nSo   for some  \n\n<$C> \n\n Yeah   I doubt it also\n\n<$B> \n\nA young girl like her to say  na  to talk like\nuh she knows so much about sex\n\n<$C> \n\nExactly\n\n<$B> \n\nUh unlikely  e kasi  it 's something it 's a\nskill  parang  like me I 'm still learning  'no\n\n  \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nI think there 's uh\n\n\nI don't know about other people but I tend to think there 's a\ncertain threshold  na  then you can say  na  oh\nit 's enjoyable it 's  ganyan  \n\n\nBut especially if you 're just starting to do it    \nparang  you 're

Titanic\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yeah  ay  wait\n\n\nYou know I watched I watched this channel uhm what was that uhm Time and Again I think it was N B C, Time and   Again  and they featured Titanic\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nFirst they featured the movies\n\n\nThe first movie was, uh Titanic in the nineteen thirties and then there was the nineteen fifties version\n\n<$B> \n\n  <unclear> word </unclear>  \n\n<$A> \n\n There were   I forgot how many versions there were but the most accurate, uh at that time was, entitled A Night to Remember   based on  a novel\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh   \n\n\nYeah I remember that\n\n\nI went I visited their homepage\n\n<$A> \n\nYou visit their homepage\n\n<$B> \n\nI visited the homepage of Titanic the Movie\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh it says there the complete details of the Titanic directed by James Cameron blah blah blah\n\n\nBut there they show us the history of the Titanic   and the  past movies the predecessor movies of the Titanic where this  this current  ano  this current version uh followed \n\n<$A> \n\n Oh yeah   \n\n\nUh hey you know what what 's interesting\n\n\nThe first few movies of the Titanic showed the Titanic sinking and then leaving something like smoke   and then  they believe that Titanic did not break\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   yeah\n\n<$A> \n\n  It  was only\n\n<$B> \n\n It only   Titanic broke only when it reached the bottom\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause maybe because of uh uh\n\n<$A> \n\nPressure\n\n<$B> \n\nYes strong water pressure\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah hey it was only this version the Titanic James Cameron that he featured the Titanic the Titanic   breaking into  \n\n<$B> \n\n Actually breaking into   two\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah and then the survivors actually claim that before it even sank it broke in two, so\n\n<$B> \n\nWow\n\n<$A> \n\nThey didn't they didn't do much of a research before\n\n<$B> \n\nUh yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nThey just maybe they just sank into <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nUh yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then and then there was this theory\n\n\nUhm they said when that was before nineteen eighty-five\n\n\nNineteen eighty-five was the time when the Titanic was found at the  at the bottom of the ocean\n\n\nUhm they they believe that the Titanic sank because the iceberg uhm made a three hundred foot gash, yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nI guess it 's the other way round\n\n\nThe boat was the one that\n\n<$A> \n\nUh no no\n\n\nUh actually they believe that uhm the iceberg was able to was able to cut through the steel of the Titanic producing a three hundred foot damage uh a gash\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nUh but then when in nineteen eighty-five the Titanic was found they found that it wasn't a three hundred foot gash but only a twelve square meter uh a twelve square meter hole\n\n\n  And  then it was shocking because it was only as big as a refrigerator and based on you know comparison of size that 's very small\n\n\nThen then how come the Titanic sank\n\n\nAnd then one explanation was because of water pressure\n\n<$B> \n\n Hole   \n\n Yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nToo much pressure on the  water that causes how many  ano  uhm uh   thousands  \n\n<$B> \n\n Gallons of water   \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah thousands of gallons of water per   second  based on research\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nYeah and remember the movie itself where uhm they were showing the evidence of how the Titanic sank\n\n\nThey were showing the old lady\n\n\nThey they showed the the the lowest level of the Titanic\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nI think I think it was the engine room\n\n\nIt turned out at the engine room  ,  that 's where the water  pressured  in\n\n\nIt was the water uh somehow hit hit the hit the boat at strategic points   as if  it wanted to sink it \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Yeah   \n\n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's started from the engine slowly sinking to the second and third level so it was adding weight to the front to the dorsal part of the boat\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIs that correct \" dorsal \" \n\n<$A> \n\nUh I don't know\n\n\nNo I think I 'm not sure I think the dorsal\n\n<$B> \n\nHow do you call it\n\n\nDorsal part of the boat adding more weight to the front\n\n\nThat 's what caused it to   break  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh yeah   yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah only the recent researchers\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah interesting\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah and there was actually a safe there was actually a safe found by a by a I think the Russian Russian uh research team\n\n\nThey they actually I I saw it in the Discovery Channel I think\n\n<$A> \n\nThey opened it\n\n<$B> \n\nThey tried to but they can't because of the jam\n\n<$A> \n\nReally jammed\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah although they found the safe uhm they they vowed never to touch any of the debris of the Titanic\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course as uh paying their respects   to the dead  there until they found upon finding the safe they found the safe\n\n\nThat 's where they broke their promise  uh well this is a uh a robotic like a submersible\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nComplete with robotic arms just like in the movie\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nThey tried to open the safe although it was still it 's still rusted it 's supposed to be weak right\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd that should have been weakened\n\n\nThey could not they couldn't get it to open\n\n<$A> \n\nUh they didn't bring the   it  to the surface \n\n<$B> \n\n They didn't bring   \n\n\nNo they just left it there because according to  ano  according to some survivors they said that that it 's useless to open it because the crew left it empty anyway before it sank\n\n<$A> \n\nUh  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nWas it empty\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat if it 's true\n\n<$A> \n\nOh  \n\n<$B> \n\nWhat if inside there was really the Heart of the Ocean  \n\n\nYou know what wait uh, \n\n\nImagine  kung Pinoy yung naka-diskubre   Filipino crew member you can turn off our destiny  toward the States  <unclear>

Cameron  with his you know\n\n<$A> \n\nWait wait wait I I read this paper and the article Manila Bulletin uh it states that the Heart of the Ocean is a fictitious   gem  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nBut some American and I think British uh British jewelers uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThey did make one\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah they did make one out of a fictitious jewel they made a real jewel\n\n<$B> \n\nHeart of

{"text": "<$A> \n\nHi Pam\n\n\nSo you 've been here for eleven to or twelve weeks already in La Salle\n\n\nHow do you find college life as a freshman\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm enjoying my life here in La Salle I mean it 's though it 's very different from the life I had in Bacolod but I 'm having fun  e  \n\n\nI get along well with my blockmates\n\n\nI mean you know I mean this college thing isn't that bad at all I mean you know I get to learn a lot of things\n\n\nHow about you you 're third year\n\n\nI mean you must have you must have encountered a lot of things already\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yes believe me I have encountered a lot of things\n\n\nFirst of all in my lifestyle\n\n\nIt has really changed\n\n\nLike in Bacolod uhm we 're used to having helpers around we have drivers like if you wanna go to this place you can just say I wanna go to this place and then snap you 're there like and here in Manila it 's like you have to commute and with the traffic and everything it takes an hour to get to just one place\n\n\nI mean that 's the least an hour it 's like the least\n\n\nAnd then uhm in Bacolod you don't cook you don't do your laundry while here in Manila you 're forced to do all those things just to survive and you have to budget your money also\n\n\nLike in Bacolod you can ask your Mom for money if you need to go shopping and everything and here it 's like you 're on a tight budget and it 's really hard with everything\n\n<$B> \n\nI you know what I find amazing in college is that because since we came from an  from an exclusive school in Bacolod I mean I find it 'cause it 's coed so I mean you know the first day that I entered school or I attended classes it 's like oh so this is this is the coed school that my other friends have been experiencing ever since\n\n\nAnd it it 's cool though because you know guys are just all around you but sometimes you will just okay I mean it it 's an  because it 's really different when you have somebody to look forward to when you enter the classroom\n\n\nI mean you know you can get so lazy sometimes and I mean like and like when you have a crush on your classroom I mean woohh okay\n\n\nSo I might as well just  attend class because I wanna feel that day so I don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nThat part I have to agree with you because I used to be in this class where I was sandwiched by these two cute guys so I was like really motivated to come to class every M W F because it was like I was really so motivated with you know I mean you 're sitting  with these two guys and then you 're having you 're getting their attention because they need a groupmate and everything\n\n\nSo you 're the first one who they come to if they don't have if they don't know what lesson is or something\n\n\nAnd it 's really fun to have to be in a coed school because we 're used to having an all-girl school in Saint Scho right\n\n\nSo it 's like uhm they 're all girls and then it 's like you face the same people every day and then here in La Salle you have the trisem\n\n\nUhm you have the trisem schedule what do you call that\n\n\nSo it 's like every term you have different classmates you meet a lot of people and then you make a lot of friends\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd you know what I mean I don't know but even in a short span of time that you know I 've been I 've been in La Salle I mean what eleven weeks\n\n\nThere was not yet enough to to say about things and to conclude or whatever\n\n\nI mean I I already I already learned a lot I mean I probably uh now I learned that I mean in college you really meet different people with different with different personalities characters\n\n\nI mean I mean uh back I mean there I can I would see some group of friends like they would dress in this and these clothes that you know I 'm not even I was I 'm not even aware of them\n\n\nBut I don't know I guess it uh it 's just it 's just it 's just fun I don't know I don't know the word but it 's just cool to to see a lot of people\n\n\nBut I guess the hard the hardest part for me right now is that I don't know where exactly I fit in 'cause since I 'm new here in Manila I don't know where or with whom exactly I could jive and I could get along with\n\n\nI mean I 'm close with my blockmates but still I mean eleven weeks it 's not enough time to really say that you know uh I belong here  \n\n\nBut I guess that 's the that 's the nice thing I mean that 's the interesting part of it\n\n\nIt 's a matter of knowing or  it 's kinda an adventure or or I don't know you get to seek for something  a mystery or I don't know I mean\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I think the studies the studying part is not really the hardest part I think it 's also the  adjustment thing\n\n\nI mean you have to be able to fit in with different types of personalities here since you 're new you don't know the the people here and then unlike in Bacolod wherein everybody knows everybody because the city is too small\n\n\nAnd then here it 's like you have to you have to really adjust and you have to adopt your personality with their personality\n\n\nAnd finding friends is really a difficult thing here but there are a lot of people who are also experiencing that kind of thing so you it 's like it helps to know that you 're not alone and then in the end you always find someone to jive with\n\n<$B> \n\nI guess that 's what I like best about being here in Manila 'cause nobody knows me and nobody nobody knows the real me so I can just do whatever I want I mean I  I can dress what in   I mean I can dress whatever I mean in that in whatever way I want to dress I mean\n\n\nAnd I guess uhm one thing that probably upsets me is that I remember back in in my L PEP the Orient thing I mean one of the one of the L officers of the Student Council told us that you don't have to in La Salle there 's no such thing as  tambayan  and you can just sit in a if you wanna sit in that certain bench you can you can sit there but  and then I believed that woohh woohh fair everybody 's equal equality is practiced\n\n\nBut then as days pass by I mean weeks after I I realized that you know okay so I can't sit there 'cause the athletes are supposed to be there and what is it\n\n\nThat that 's college I mean sometimes you just have to say that that that 's the way that 's the  that 's the way things happen here\n\n\nI mean if say I 'm not saying it that treatment of people or there 's inequality or you know but I guess that the I don't know fun it 's so I don't know Jane I mean\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I agree with you I mean with the new image thing people don't know you so you can work here uhm sensitive angle here or your fun angle here or whatever angle you want so you can dress the way you want that 's really that 's really an advantage here considering that we don't have uniforms\n\n\nThank God for that rule\n\n\nAnd also with with what you said about the  tambayan  thing that 's really true because no matter what they say about having equality here in La Salle it 's there 's always a sense of hierarchy\n\n\nLike there 's always a structure like this part is for the athletes this is for the upperclassmen and then you can't of course you just can't mingle with them just like that\n\n\nI mean but after uh sometime you tend to these people tend to to graduate I mean they graduate they leave La Salle and then you take over their position and then people like you in in the first year also experience the same thing as you do\n\n\nSo I think that 's just a part of life and that 's just a part of college life that everybody goes through because everybody is struggling to be up there\n\n\nEverybody is struggling to fit in right\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah and I just I just wanna ask\n\n\nAre you having a hard time waking up\n\n\nI mean I have a seven o'clock class and it 's really a complete burden for me to wake up at  I mean what six\n\n\n'Cause I still have to plan on what clothes to wear\n\n\nI mean okay I there 's an advantage not to not having our uniform but there 's also a disadvantage to that because you know I mean the way they say that no it doesn't matter what on what it doesn't matter whatever you wear it 's good but duh it does I mean\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I have to agree with that\n\n\nNo matter what they say uhm fashion is always a big thing for students right\n\n\nI mean you have to you you need to look your best\n\n\nI mean why look worst when you can look your best I mean that 's always a good model\n\n\nI mean what happens if you meet these people and then you 're not in your best appearance that day\n\n\nSo it reflects a lot on your personality too\n\n\nAnd yes I have uhm difficult time I have a difficult time in waking up since I have an eight o'clock class everyday so I have to wake up at seven\n\n\nAnd that is really that is really a burden for me that is really so hard\n\n\nAnd then plus I also go through the same thing as you do in choosing clothes\n\n\nI usually change and then I 'm not happy with what I look and then I change again and then I just tuck all my clothes in my cabinet until I can't see the I can't see the organization of my clothes anymore\n\n\nI mean it it 's really it really affects you a lot right\n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n\nSo what do you think about the trisem system here in La Salle\n\n<$A> \n\nWell the trisem system here in La Salle in one word if you describe it in one word it 's fast\n\n\nI mean if you compare it with  La Salle system in Bacolod they have two terms a year and if we have our our midterm exams they 're having their preliminary exams\n\n\nAnd while we 're having our finals they 're just having their midterm exams so you can imagine how how fast our pacing is\n\n\nI mean you 're expected to absorb a handful of information in that short of time and that 's really difficult\n\n\nI mean I don't know how students can cope with that I mean I don't know how I coped with that\n\n\nI mean for staying on La Salle for almost three years here I don't know how I survived that kind of pacing when I 'm used to uhm I I need a lot of time to prepare myself for a quiz and everything\n\n\nAnd then here in La Salle it 's like oh you have a long exam tomorrow so you have to study and it 's like everything is really time pressured here\n\n\nIt 's like you can really see the importance of your of time managing of time management here\n\n\nWhat about you\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I too am having a hard time especially that I 'm still in my first year and you know period of adjustment  etcetera etcetera\n\n\nI mean this is really it 's really hard for me sometimes to  I used to have a hard time\n\n\nUhm when I wake up in the morning I don't know I mean I would say oh my gosh I have to I have to I have to go to school I have to attend class because you know I mean I I will end the the term sooner\n\n\nI mean in a few in a few weeks I mean the first term I will have my finals already and I can't I can't afford to miss a single lesson 'cause everything as you say I mean here in La Salle it 's really fast\n\n\nAnd and I know it 's a privilege to be here and I just can't you know I I don't wanna be the block I don't wanna I don't wanna waste this opportunity to have a good education\n\n\nAnd that 's why I 'm really trying my uh trying hard to to cope with this certain trisem system\n\n\nAnd I think that you know if I pass the exam I might as well I mean I I I can I can cope with this I can I can surpass or I can survive this you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYes I mean being able to survive your first eleven or twelve weeks here is a big stuff already\n\n\nI mean I know of some people who who just stay here for a week and then they go home to Bacolod I mean they 're wasting their money and then they 're not even trying that hard\n\n\nBut I admire you for being so optimistic and and optimistic and very goal goal-oriented for that", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

and you know what I did is that I recorded their voices  \n\n<$A>  \n\nYou you really have this I mean you  you really like recording people 's voices right\n\n<$B>  \n\n\n   You can say that  \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n You 're even doing that    all week now\n\n<$B>  \n\nYou can say that 'cause you see Hanzel is so annoying \n\n\nLast Saturday he keeps on he keeps on singing\n\n<$A>  \n\nSinging

mean Hanzel singing and    dancing  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Dancing    \n\n<$A>  \n\nNo I really can't figure it\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah I can't I cannot picture it I don't know\n\n<$A>  \n\nDid you ever look at his yearbook picture he looks so he looks so innocent    far far different  from college \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Yeah    yeah you can say that\n\n\nHe 's still those were the days\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah those were the days when Hanzel was still innocent and childish\n\n<$B>  \n\nChildish\n\n<$A>  \n\nWhat time is your test tonight\n\n<$B>  \n\nTonight uhm I think they 're going to give the exam this afternoon it 's a take-home exam take-home exam\n\n<$A>  \n\nIt 's a take-home exam but you 're going to do it to do it in school\n\n<$B>  \n\nYes of course I don't have anyone to copy from at

One\n\n<$A>  \n\nI really don't like circuits I mean looking at looking at you uh earlier with all that wires and circuits, I may go crazy when it 's going to\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah    me too  \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n When it 's going    to be my life with it\n\n<$B>  \n\nMe too that 's why I grouped with the people  \n\n<$A>  \n\nWho 's going to do the job for you\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah I mean\n\n<$A>  \n\nThat 's right I can really notice it\n\n<$B>  \n\nNotice what\n\n<$A>  \n\nAll the guys are doing their job  unlike you I mean you 're the only girl and you 're the only one who 's not doing anything\n\n<$B>  \n\n\n   One of my classmates  \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Except except    cutting all the wires\n\n<$B>  \n\nYou know what one of my classmates told me that I 'm the muse of MICPRO One\n\n<$A>  \n\nReally    'cause you 're the only girl  in your section\n\n<$B>  \n\n\n 'Cause I 'm the only girl    yup\n\n<$A>  \n\nAnd what does uh some guys think about it think about it\n\n<$B>  \n\nI don't care\n\n<$A>  \n\nReally\n\n<$B>  \n\nI don't care as long as one guy thinks\n\n<$A>  \n\nYou 're the cutest\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah one of my classmates told me\n\n<$A>  \n\nCan you picture yourself being classmates with  Joseph  \n\n<$B>  \n\nI don't know    parang  it 's like I don't know\n\n<$A>  \n\nYou 're going to be very shy about it\n\n<$B>  \n\nYes\n\n<$A>  \n\nAnd you 're going you 're not going to uh you 're    not going  to talk\n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Yes    I 'm not going to talk 'cause with all his  barkadas  there I don't think I 'll be able to make you know be the usual\n\n<$A>  \n\nYou 're not going to be your usual talkative self\n\n<$B>  \n\nNo I 'm not talkative I 'm usually quiet\n\n<$A>  \n\nReally\n\n<$B>  \n\nYes\n\n<$A>  \n\nI really thought  na  you 're a chatterbox\n\n<$B>  \n\nNo you 're the chatterbox\n\n<$A>  \n\nMe\n\n<$B>  \n\nYes\n\n<$A>  \n\nEven though I constantly get uh the best conduct in high school\n\n<$B>  \n\nThat was in high school that was in high school  that 's different    \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n I am quiet    I am quiet in my class\n\n\nMy teacher in English can say that\n\n<$B>  \n\nOh\n\n<$A>  \n\nI really don't talk I really don't talk that 's why I know  na  she 'll never give me that five bonus points 'cause I never talk\n\n<$B>  \n\nYou never talk but this is the proof that you talk\n\n<$A>  \n\nThis is the only proof this is our only proof, I mean when she when she asked me in in class sometimes I talk in one sentence I mean it 's the limit\n\n<$B>  \n\nOne sentence only\n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Ha  you should see Reynolds he doesn't talk I mean when when my teacher in English class calls him, it 's as if he 's at a loss\n\n\nHe 's always like that I mean my teacher looks at him  I mean incredulously\n\n\nBut you know what my English teacher looks like my auntie you see she really looks like my auntie\n\n<$B>  \n\nReally\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$B>  \n\nDo you have a demo\n\n<$A>  \n\nWhen\n\n<$B>  \n\nFor your English class\n\n<$A>  \n\nNo\n\n\nShe just wants us to submit the revised paper on April eight\n\n<$B>  \n\nUh uh uhm in our class we have\n\n<$A>  \n\nWell she she told us  na  she 's implementing a different syllabus in our class\n\n<$B>  \n\nUh\n\n<$A>  \n\nBut you know it 's better  pero  it 's so slow 'cause when I proposed my thesis proposal this term  ano  I passed I passed

\n\nHis wife poisoned him no\n\n<$B> \n\nNo it 's not poison it 's like uh Marcos 's sleeping pills or something\n\n\nSo when he woke up he he found himself tied to like a furniture or\n\n<$A>

but Louella meant it as a joke but then Annabel\n\n<$B> \n\nTook it seriously\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah   I know  that story\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nUh we met at the library and I was kind of shocked I was studying and then Annabel just told me that she was very annoyed with Wheng the way she reacted to her\n\n\nAnnabel told me that she wasn't there for her but she was at least she was trying to see a classmate for a second just gonna ask something but then just Wheng told her to get out\n\n\nIt was like, there really is no love lost between the two of them\n\n\nBut you know what when I talked to Louella she didn't know that Annabel was Amanda 's friend\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah she had no idea until until I think until Rachel told her\n\n\nI think I told her\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah because\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you 're the one\n\n<$A> \n\nWell well it was out of my mouth I mean I can't do anything to take it back so she asked me you know how persistent she can be\n\n<$B> \n\nI think sometimes Wheng is out of line, you know I mean\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nWell she has some problems right now\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat problems\n\n<$B> \n\nI think she has so many things to do\n\n\nShe 's so busy so pressured then she ran she ran for the Student Council\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd she had so many  jobs  right and she felt that no one is supporting her, \n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe she doesn't need support from but then I mean we 're in college now\n\n<$B> \n\nCome on I mean you could get old as a hundred and one but you still need friends\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I I don't mean it you don't need friends\n\n\nWhat I mean is that you can't always count on your friends because they have some some uh some things they are some they have someone else they have   other things to do  \n\n<$B> \n\n Other things to do   but still\n\n<$A> \n\nThey have other friends too\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but still, Louella needs a friend you know you know she 's uh often   a sensitive  person\n\n<$A> \n\n I think    \n\n\nWell she does not have a constant friend in U P\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nI I think so\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I think she always, go with Cathy\n\n<$A> \n\nCathy\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah, \n\n<$A> \n\nWell I don't think so\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I heard they also had a small misunderstanding\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat misunderstanding\n\n<$B> \n\nWell\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know that\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah it 's something new it still is a new thing you think well it seems it seems that Louella wanted to use Cathy 's computer\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nThen, Cathy has to go somewhere\n\n<$A> \n\nYup so Louella can't use the computer\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah then on the day that Cathy is supposed to go Marites went to Cathy 's house and used the computer\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nThen Cathy left the house since  is going out is going to type a document but Louella was supposed to program something and she doesn't know anything about it\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's why Cathy was able to let Marites use the computer so 'cause she can beep her anytime\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd when she returned Cathy to her house she and Marites went bar-hopping or something\n\n\nThen when Louella heard it I think she got annoyed\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I think Louella should understand it, it 's not, it 's not for Cathy to entrust her with  ano  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah, so many misunderstandings with Louella  \n\n\nWill Louella ever learn to understand\n\n<$A> \n\nOh no maybe she 's just have some issues\n\n<$B> \n\nI think she 's trying she 's trying to change but it 's not enough\n\n\nSometimes it 's hard to get <unclear> word </unclear> to understand her\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's right but still we have to give her leeway\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah, \n\n<$A> \n\nWell\n\n<$B> \n\nRemember when she went there\n\n<$A> \n\nWith\n\n\nHere   oh  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   I I find her I was kinda annoyed\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\nShe was she was telling this joke I don't remember it\n\n\nI was really very

can't make it  \n\n<$A> \n\nBut anyway\n\n<$B> \n\nAnyway\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then what happened\n\n<$B> \n\n Ay  sorry\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's okay it 's okay\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n<$B> \n\nBut anyway uh she she made  kwento  about Julio\n\n\nSo they 've been dating for three months\n\n\nYou know that\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm, I uh well what I heard was she has a crush on him but not\n\n<$B> \n\nBut you didn't know that  uh sorry Julio, like her dude\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no no\n\n<$B> \n\nReally\n\n\nAnyway, so they 've been going out they 've been dating for three months and like they know that they like each other\n\n\nUhm they confessed to each other already but the thing is uhm Bea I think she 's  found out last night that I think she asked Julio if he was like okay he was if he was just fine with their relationship with what 's going on with them right now 'cause they 're like they 're, you can't say that they 're just friends 'cause they 're\n\n<$A> \n\nAlready   committed  with each other\n\n<$B> \n\n Really   \n\n\nYeah they 're really close and like but you can't say that they 're lovers 'cause you know it 's so sad Tony is not uh sorry Julio\n\n\nWhy do I keep mentioning that guy 's name I 'll forget him anyway\n\n\nJulio is not yet ready to commit\n\n\nWhat 's even more sad about it is that Bea\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nBea is ready I mean\n\n<$A> \n\nJulio is her her first guy I mean she hasn't had any boyfriend\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah she haven't had any boyfriend\n\n\nWell Julio is not actually her boyfriend\n\n<$A> \n\nBut\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nThe one she 's willing to commit with\n\n<$B> \n\n yeah\n\n\nAnd it 's so you know it 's so sad 'cause finally she 's done with her you know playing whatever she calls it games whatever with guys\n\n\nBut, and now she 's finally ready to, have a commitment with a guy and\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but I 'm sure, even though I don't know Julio that much I 'm quite sure that he really likes Bea a lot\n\n\nMaybe he 's just yeah scared\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you think that 's what 's stopping him\n\n\nThat 's it I mean he is just scared   I mean not  \n\n<$B> \n\n Well    \n\n\nWhat what do you have to say\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know 'cause if you just if you say that he 's just scared don't you think it 's a bit what lame\n\n\nSuch a lame excuse to say that uh the guy is just afraid of committing or not yet ready\n\n\nI mean if you love someone you have to be willing to risk it\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know what you 're right\n\n\nIf, I don't know I just can't seem to blame this guy\n\n\nI heard that he had a very bad break-up with his you know former girlfriend\n\n\nAnd like I think he left for States and uhm so he made  paalam  to the girl and then, the girl you know his former girlfriend\n\n<$A> \n\nHis ex\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah his ex uhm told him that it 's okay uh I 'll wait for you   'cause I really love you  ganyan ganyan  and all that stuff  \n\n<$A> \n\n <unclear> words </unclear>   \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd like so the guy was like okay 'cause he was really in love with that girl and, when he came back from from States he found out that just a few months after he left the girl had a new guy\n\n<$A> \n\nHuh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo okay\n\n<$A> \n\nSad for him\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah it 's so sad sad for him\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nSo there you know\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you think that 's his excuse\n\n<$B> \n\nActually I haven't really talked to this guy so I 'm just assuming that it 's that 's his reason\n\n\nBut you know it 's just so why do I keep on saying it 's sad well it is sad\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I don't know I mean I 've met guys who like had bad break-ups and   all  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nBut I mean to say that you 're afraid because of your past that you might do something wrong that whatever, \n\n<$B> \n\nWell   anyway  \n\n<$A> \n\n That 's   not how love goes\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's how I think\n\n<$B> \n\nWell we don't know their reasons so\n\n\nWould, let me just ask you what do you think about their relationship right now\n\n\nLike they go out they date uhm they 're more than friends they 're, you know  parang  M U  \n\n<$A> \n\nFun\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's actually more than that more than just M U, \n\n<$A> \n\nWell, for me I think that I mean even if like she 's saying that she 's okay with that or they 're fine with that set-up I don't think that it is it 's enough\n\n\nI mean  ,  you if you really care for a person, you have to what be willing, \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nTo risk\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nTo take the risk\n\n<$A> \n\nI mean even if you 're afraid I mean anything for love right\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's true\n\n\nWell, to some extent  \n\n<$A> \n\nTo some extent that 's true\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah to some extent 'cause you know\n\n<$A> \n\nBut still you have to know your levels\n\n\n  But  still I mean what 's what 's to be afraid\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nIt sounds weird\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know what\n\n\nMaybe you should talk to Bea give her a call or something\n\n<$A> \n\nWell yeah maybe I can do that\n\n<$B> \n\nBut she 's like, she 's so  you could see it in her eyes that she 's so happy\n\n\nMy gosh she talks about him every now and then every you know  siya na 'yung buka ng bibig di ba    \n\n<$A> \n\nSpeaking of  buka ng bibig  have you heard from Renee lately\n\n<$B> \n\nI was with her  di ba  \n\n\nWe were in we were at the party but she didn't we didn't talk  \n\n<$A> \n\nHave you heard of what happened to her I mean the crying scene and all\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I did but

talking\n\n\nAnd then you love the person\n\n\nDon't you think it 's a bit weird\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm I think she 's blinded  by the thought that being in love is good\n\n\nI mean it 's a good feeling so, initially she  she 's in love with the thought\n\n<$A> \n\nOf love being\n\n<$B> \n\nOf finding someone to love\n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know\n\n<$A> \n\nWell anyway what 's funny about this is that she <unclear> word </unclear> at a guy who doesn't really like her   okay  \n\n<$B> \n\n Ahhh   \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I know it 's sad but it 's not a funny thing actually I 'm sorry\n\n<$B>

\n\n\nShe cried because what because she was I I don't know I haven't really talked to her but  ano  just the thought of her crying, uhm made me laugh\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so wait I don't get it\n\n\nShe

about it  \n\n<$B> \n\n Oh my God   \n\n<$A> \n\nSo I mean what will happen\n\n\nOf course Mike, what he   might learn about it  \n\n<$B> \n\n Mike will eventually   know about   this  \n\n<$A> \n\n

trying to do the most number of things in the least amount of time in order to do more with the time that you have\n\n<$B>  \n\nAnd what 's the barometer by  by which you can say that that you were able to use that time\n\n<$A>  \n\nUh it 's really relative\n\n\nIt depends on the person so it adjusts    to the person  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n It depends    on the objectives\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah the

mean all the work all the load of work in a day\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah that 's a problem    of most people <unclear> word </unclear>   \n\n<$C>  \n\n\n Of being a teacher    at the same time being a

who say that they are very busy are the would you say they 're more successful in\n\n<$A>  \n\nIn what they do\n\n<$C>  \n\nIn what they do right\n\n<$A>  \n\nI don't think so\n\n\nThose who are busy\n\n<$C>  \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A>  \n\nYou can be successful by doing nothing\n\n\nYou see people who just call on the phone and watch their stocks    and do nothing  \n\n<$C>  \n\n\n Just killing their time    but at the same time earning    money  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n I suggest    that\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$B>  \n\nWe should put a parameter on how are we going to define success\n\n\nSo this time perhaps that 's        \n\n<$C>  \n\n\n Time    and success  'yan  \n\n<$A>  \n\nTime and    success  \n\n<$C>  \n\n\n Time and    success\n\n<$A>  \n\nIt 's very dangerous\n\n\nI don't want    to talk about  that\n\n<$C>  \n\n\n Time and success    \n\n<$A>  \n\nBut do you want to talk about it    go ahead  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Success    what 's success by the way\n\n<$A>  \n\nSuccess is getting what you want when you want it\n\n<$B>  \n\nGetting what you want when you want it\n\n<$A>  \n\nThat 's it\n\n<$B>  \n\nThat 's it\n\n<$A>  \n\nThat 's it\n\n<$B>  \n\nHow about if you were not able to get it and your objective is not to get it\n\n<$A>  \n\nIt 's a problem then\n\n\nYou 're not successful I suppose\n\n<$B>  \n\nYou 're successful\n\n\nYou were not able to get what you want    and what you want  \n\n<$C>  \n\n\n That 's putting    aside morality  ha  because you can be successful in bad things\n\n<$A>  \n\nThat 's a logical fantasy  that thing you brought up\n\n<$C>  \n\nSee\n\n<$B>  \n\nWhat come again come again\n\n<$C>  \n\nYou can be successful in bad things in doing bad things like if you 're a robber then and then you try robbing a bank then you 're successful if you happen to do that\n\n\nBut would you say that is success\n\n<$A>  \n\nLike I said it 's a negative    argument  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n To the good one    to the good ones of course\n\n<$A>  \n\nThat 's another big problem\n\n\nDon't don't bring that in that 's morality\n\n<$C>  \n\nMorality\n\n\nMore more delicate topic to talk about, than time  \n\n<$A>  \n\nLet 's get rid of time because\n\n<$B>  \n\nDeath\n\n<$A>  \n\nIt 's a deep concept\n\n\nLet 's try something else\n\n<$B>  \n\nDeath\n\n\nYou    want to  \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n How    \n\n\nDeath you want to talk about death why death\n\n<$B>  \n\nBecause it 's the end of time\n\n<$A>  \n\nIt 's the end of time so we 're still back in time\n\n<$C>  \n\nDeath\n\n\nIt 's not it may be the end of time but it    may be a beginning  of something else\n\n<$B>  \n\n\n No particular    \n\n\nActually time will continue time will continue  whether we are here or not but to for a particular person\n\n<$A>  \n\nTime will end\n\n<$B>  \n\nYes\n\n<$A>  \n\nThat 's true\n\n\nBut I don't want to talk about death\n\n<$B>  \n\nWhy\n\n<$A>  \n\nIt 's one of those things that\n\n<$B>  \n\nYou 're talking to it right now\n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Yes you could actually say that but let 's change the topic\n\n<$B>  \n\nOkay\n\n<$A>  \n\nLet 's get rid of that altogether\n\n\nWhy don't we just talk about the kids here\n\n<$B>  \n\nThe kids\n\n<$A>  \n\nLet 's talk about the kids here\n\n\nIf you were to leave this place which kids would    you miss  \n\n<$C>  \n\n\n The school the school    you mean the school\n\n<$A>

concerned they are the ones who the first time that I taught in this school they are the ones whom I deal with\n\n\nThat 's why I believe\n\n<$C>  \n\nI 'd like to think about how how uh preschoolers though I 'm not teaching preschoolers now I 'd like to think about how preschoolers would appreciate your teaching them\n\n\nIf I 'm to compare it with high school students\n\n<$A>  \n\nI don't think that I would be able to handle    preschoolers  \n\n<$C>  \n\n\n Well    because because because    preschoolers  are very showy \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n It 's just    it 's just like\n\n<$C>  \n\nThey would hug you    be with you kiss you  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Comparing the game of Benjie Paras    from from that of of\n\n<$C>  \n\nWho 's Benjie Paras\n\n<$A&$B>  \n\nJohnny Abarrientos\n\n<$A>  \n\nYes

position he 'll play the same game\n\n<$C>  \n\n\n   Hey are we still talking about time  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n No we 're now talking about basketball    \n\n<$C>  \n\nNow we 're discussing basketball\n\n<$B>  \n\nBasketball basketball is life life is basketball we play the balls\n\n\nThe  in in the school the referees are the teachers the students are the ones who make their their careers they are the ones who are making their playing time\n\n<$A>  \n\nSo maybe we could go back again to the students\n\n<$B>  \n\nYes yes\n\n<$A>  \n\nTo the students\n\n\nWe 're deviating from the topic\n\n<$B>  \n\nWe can as as referees we can also throw the students out of the playing court which is their room and we set rules\n\n\nWe set everything to to put everything in proper perspective so teaching is basketball\n\n<$C>  \n\nTeaching is basketball\n\n<$B>  \n\nThe points the points we grade are the statistics\n\n<$A>  \n\nYes statistics\n\n<$B>  \n\nThose students who raise their hands get the high grades\n\n<$A>  \n\nThey get the chance to shoot the ball\n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah    and the ball  \n\n<$C>  \n\n\n And it 's their own    game and they don't blame anybody\n\n\nIt 's their own game they 're    playing  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n       unfortunately the parents will will blame the teachers blame them upon knowing that they had paid the tuition fees and and suddenly they were the students must go to another school\n\n<$A>  \n\nThat 's their right that 's their right to criticize\n\n<$B>  \n\nAnd it 's our right to\n\n<$C>  \n\nTo\n\n<$A>  \n\nYes\n\n<$B>  \n\nTo remove their children especially when they    are  \n\n<$C>  \n\n\n Those    those are the narrow-minded parents\n\n<$B>  \n\nAnd\n\n<$C>  \n\nThey put the blame\n\n<$B>  \n\nSo the referee the referee going back to basketball the referee will will give technical technical penalty for Tim Cone so Tim Cone gets out of the playing court just\n\n<$A>  \n\nSo Tim Cone would be representing the parents <unclear> 2 words </unclear> or\n\n<$B>  \n\nThe parents or the students\n\n<$A>  \n\nUh okay\n\n<$B>  \n\nAnd we teachers\n\n<$C>  \n\nIf we 're to compare it to basketball then it 's going to be limited also like it 's only basketball here in Metro Manila\n\n<$B>  \n\nM B A is that\n\n<$C>  \n\nWhat if what if what if the students uh sooner or later would decide to go abroad  o  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n   That 's the Olympics the Olympics the Olympics  \n\n<$C>  \n\n\n You can't compare it to basketball the Olympics      \n\n<$B>  \n\nIt 's the Olympics\n\n<$A>  \n\nIt 's a different game it 's a    bigger  game\n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Now    now now I would like you to listen very  \n\n<$C>  \n\nThat 's exactly what we 're doing\n\n\n\n   As teachers  we 're preparing them for a    bigger world  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Carefully about this    \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n A bigger game    \n\n<$C>  \n\nYes\n\n<$B>  \n\nNow teachers are like basketball players\n\n\nOnce\n\n<$C>  \n\nThis time it 's us    not the students anymore  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Yes yes    \n\n\nOnce once the the owner of the school no  she she 's not not the teacher 's no longer competent suddenly it can put me\n\n<$C>

\n\nYeah because we don't wanna be dominated as much as they don't wanna be dominated\n\n\nI guess if you see eye to eye that 's better and there 's respect, \n\n<$C> \n\nWhat\n\n<$B> \n\nYou 're\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> he knows\n\n<$A> \n\nReally\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah   you won't find guys  who who like equality\n\n<$A> \n\n You don't like equality   \n\n<$B> \n\nHardly\n\n<$A>

one you may shout at me or whatever but you can never touch me I 'll kill you  \n\n\nAnd I think it  it it also depends on how you deal with the fight\n\n\nIf you start shouting and cursing I guess of

\n\nYeah yeah   that 's it   \n\n<$A> \n\n Okay okay   it 's good it 's actually sweet   and uh  the the old people at the office like it\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nAnd aside from it we also have the production company of food uhm that is Dunkin Donuts\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat they produce donuts there\n\n<$B> \n\nYes they produce Dunkin Donuts and\n\n<$A> \n\nSo that 's where they cook all the donuts uh around Metro Manila\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm no only here in uh Laguna\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm they uh produce all those Dunkin Donuts uhm only here  sa  only here in Laguna for different stores that they have\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n\nSo you go home every day   and the  traffic in Los Ba&ntilde;os I think is really very bad uh\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah I go home   \n\n\nUhm during six P M in the afternoon\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nLike that   and  \n\n<$A> \n\n By   the way uh you studied in uhm Metro Manila or in uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI studied at F E U Far Eastern   University  \n\n<$A> \n\n Okay   \n\n<$B> \n\nIn Recto in Manila\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you so you you you what do you, board   boarded  there or what\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nUhm I used to live in a dormitory   when  I was in college\n\n<$A> \n\n Okay   \n\n\nI see\n\n\nWell when I was in college I lived with my parents and uh by the way I I took up uh Engineering   Industrial  Engineering\n\n<$B> \n\n Where   \n\n<$A> \n\nAt uh La Salle one of those uh\n\n<$B> \n\nLa Salle\n\n<$A> \n\n Why you have uh a notion for La Sallites or   what  \n\n<$B> \n\n Uhm   well-off uh students  \n\n\n  You 're known  for that  \n\n<$A> \n\n Well   not really\n\n\nUh   it 's not  \n\n<$B> \n\n And I   I remember when we 're fighting for the U A A P  \n\n\n  Uh uhm  \n\n<$A> \n\n Well   uh my time was N C A A so\n\n<$B> \n\nN C A A  \n\n<$A> \n\nSo you probably could guess how old I am  \n\n<$B> \n\nUhm so during my time  \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm U A A P\n\n\nSo when we 're cheering for F E U   the  La Sallites would just simply tell us that our tuition fees are your allowances  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nOh come on\n\n\nI don't think that 's the case probably 'cause in I in Engineering uh where I belong   uh  really most of our classmates came from the  deep  provinces\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know but sometimes meaning well-off probably they have some a few cattle and\n\n<$B> \n\n Hacienda   \n\n<$A> \n\nNo no no not a  hacienda  probably a small piece of land\n\n\nThe usual uh townspeople with you know a few square meters of land that they they till\n\n<$B> \n\n  Okay  \n\n<$A> \n\n And   it 's always a joke during uhm semester payments that oh my father has has to sell  ,  you know a cow in order to you know \n\n\nThat 's the normal joke among those   people  from Batangas  especially with the oops that 's my cellphone \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$A> \n\nExcuse me uhm are cellphones uh a fad here still a fad or what\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah it is  and most of the teenagers uh have them\n\n<$A> \n\nReally it 's\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen you when you ride a jeepney when you look at the right side or the left side they use to  hold this a little gadget and sometimes they smile sometimes \n\n<$A> \n\nIs it   still  \n\n<$B> \n\n They are   shocked\n\n<$A> \n\nIs it still a fad or is it a it 's becoming a social status or or a necessity\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm I don't think it 's a necessity for youth\n\n<$A> \n\nFor the youth\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nWell actually it could be a monitoring device of the parents  that 's one reason why why these people have it\n\n\nSome\n\n<$B> \n\nBut they can off the cell\n\n<$A> \n\nYes but of course they must have a very good reason why they switch it off\n\n\n otherwise it should be kept open and uh it should be always on, waiting for messages or calls\n\n<$B> \n\nThere are so many alibis of the youth  when it comes to gimmicks so I don't think the parents can use that for   a monitoring device  \n\n<$A> \n\n Do you   do you go on gimmicks I mean here in this area\n\n<$B> \n\nMe\n\n\n  Uhm  \n\n<$A> \n\n So   what 's the new place here or what\n\n<$B> \n\nThere are several uh   places  that you can\n\n<$A> \n\n Jers   \n\n\nHave you been to Jers\n\n<$B> \n\nNo  \n\n<$A> \n\nSo what 's the\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't go out at night\n\n<$A> \n\n  Okay  \n\n<$B> \n\n I   usually go home after work but uh  sometimes \n\n<$A> \n\nSo strict  ha  you 're  \n\n<$B> \n\nSometimes I go  sa  uh I go to the place of my friend and just in their house\n\n<$A> \n\nBut\n\n<$B> \n\nEating talking\n\n<$A> \n\nUh so you 're more of a friendly uh type and it 's not the   outgoing  \n\n<$B> \n\n The outgoing   type\n\n<$A> \n\nGo in the crowd uh y'know those  sosy  type they call it\n\n<$B> \n\n Kinda\n\n<$A> \n\nAre there are there places here that people hang around I mean here in Calamba\n\n<$B> \n\nThere are several malls in here\n\n\nWe have the Walter Mart\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nWe have Robinson in Los Ba&ntilde;os\n\n\nWe have   Olivarez  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   but these are the mall mall types but   I mean  in the evening\n\n<$B> \n\n You mean   \n\n<$A> \n\nAre there  ,  places where the young people can socialize   or  maybe that 's why they call them  sosyal 'no  'cause they socialize at night  \n\n<$B> \n\n In the evening   \n\n\n Uhm   \n\n\nUhm there is one place I heard of uh near or beside Chowking here in Calamba\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I think that 's Jers\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's Jers okay\n\n\n  I don't know the name  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah but uh   it 's kinda expensive you   pay  an entrance of I think two hundred\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nTwo  two hundred\n\n<$A> \n\nBut it 's I think consumable\n\n\nBut still uhm I haven't been to the place\n\n\nUh we dropped by but uh when we learned that there was a two hundred cover charge we backed off and settled for well I not really cheaper place but somewhere uh a place that you know you you don't have to pay cover charge\n\n<$B> \n\nAnyway you live at\n\n<$A> \n\nWell actually I live in Makati\n\n<$B> \n\nIn Makati\n\n<$A> \n\nYes   uh  \n\n<$B> \n\n And   you  you used to go here   in Calamba  \n\n<$A> \n\n No   I I work here\n\n\nI work in   Canlubang  so most of my officemates uh it 's part of my job  'no  I 'm I 'm with H R \n\n<$B> \n\n Okay   \n\n\nH R\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's my or one of my responsibilities to look around uh where are the places that people can go so where are the  uh where are the places where people should not go\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nSo\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you 're really interested in people\n\n<$A> \n\nWell uh as part of my job I uh I have to have interest \n\n\nIt 's not uh a requirement that I follow it 's more of that uh I enjoy uh not really meddling into people 's lives but I I would like them to uhm watchacall this uh to do what they like to do\n\n\nOkay 'cause some people they like to do something but uh it 's very hard for them to do it 'cause uh they don't know how to do it\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm so what do you find uhm interesting or uh what is the best thing in uh people management\n\n<$A> \n\nWell uh it 's a very nice question\n\n\nUh the best thing I would say uh well they have different problems\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nThey have different priorities\n\n\nUh there are different ways to make them smile\n\n\nYou know like like texting you know some\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nSome people laugh at these types of joke\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know you don't know you don't see why  why it 's funny or what\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n\nSo you find it uhm uh interesting to know the uniqueness of a   human being   \n\n<$A> \n\n Wow really  ha    \n\n\nIt might get developed  ha   \n\n\nWell to in a sense   it 's uh  \n\n<$B> \n\n The   individuality\n\n<$A> \n\nYes 'cause each person has his own idiosyncrasies and uh each person has uh well you say the likes and dislikes\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's very basic  'no  but uhm what I 've learned through my years of being in H R is that there are ways to  excuse me to get to people uhm there there there are different ways\n\n\nEach person has a different   approach  \n\n<$B> \n\n Okay   \n\n\nSo can you cite some ways that you have learned before\n\n<$A> \n\nSome ways well there 's some people that uh you ask about their family and you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nSuddenly they they 'll open up something about work or about a suggestion\n\n\nUh I believe in bonding\n\n<$B> \n\nBonding\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n\nYou have to bond with people and uh well like like for example now you know there 's a certain level of bonding that uh we 're doing\n\n<$B> \n\nReally  \n\n<$A> \n\n It doesn't mean anything but uh I 'm not a a psychologist actually I\n\n<$B> \n\nYou graduated as\n\n<$A> \n\nI graduated as Industrial Engineering\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay   sorry I forgot  \n\n<$A> \n\n But my   Industrial Management Engineering   it 's a  Management Engineering type and uh well we have subjects about uh human behavior and uh\n\n<$B> \n\n I see   \n\n\nSociology perhaps\n\n<$A> \n\nWell all those -ologies and everything  but uh the most important in the one I remember was on human behavior\n\n<$B> \n\nHuman behavior\n\n<$A> \n\n'Cause uh basic human behavior is like uh hand gestures the hand gestures and the the the eye contacts   and everything  \n\n<$B> \n\n Eye contacts   \n\n<$A> \n\nLike you you have very good eye contact  \n\n\nSometimes you you know I I get bothered when people have very direct eye contact\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I don't know\n\n\nMaybe something 's wrong with my face or something 's  \n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n\nBut do you find it uhm sincere and honest when people look at you straight in the eyes  \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah but uh I like it the other way around that I I look uh\n\n<$B> \n\nLook at your nose look at your  \n\n<$A> \n\nI like it the other way around that you know I I 'm the one looking at the person\n\n<$B> \n\nBut how can the person respond    uh\n\n<$A> \n\nIf uh well I don't know it it 's different uh sometimes uh people are more comfortable not looking\n\n\nThere 's some people that are more comfortable looking\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I learned from a friend that when you talk to someone it is ethical to look at their eyes direct\n\n<$A> \n\nUh well of course yes to show your sincerity it 's very basic but sometimes staring  too much uh you know you 'd  there 's what you call glance a stare and uh I don't know\n\n\nBut but most of the people I talk to uh I look at their eyes\n\n\nBut of course to show some respect sometimes I I glance away it 's actually a sign of respect glancing away\n\n<$B> \n\nA sign of respect\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's not a sign of uh indifference\n\n\nIt 's more of a sign of respect like especially if you look downwards\n\n\nIf you look upwards that that 's a sign of disrespect  \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nAnyway so what what do you do on Sundays I mean   if you 're not  working or what\n\n<$B> \n\n On Sundays   \n\n\nUhm I usually go out and uhm attend the Sunday Sunday service\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nIn our local church in Los Ba&ntilde;os and I handle ushering committee\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat what 's the ushering committee\n\n<$B> \n\nUh we are the one who welcomes all those people that uh, go to the church every Sunday\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nThere are uh several uh responsibilities that we have uhm one of which is that uh we uh make it a point that uh\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAll those first timers are at\n\n<$A> \n\n what   what 's the  population of the church\n\n<$B> \n\n Treated   \n\n<$A> \n\nYou have a number or, one thousand or what\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm our church is a pioneering church   and we  only have around uhm, seven hundred or three hundred\n\n<$A> \n\n Okay   \n\n\nUh okay I see\n\n<$B> \n\nMembers\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n\nSo that 's every Sunday   and plus uh  \n\n<$B> \n\n Every Sunday   eight to eleven\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nIn the morning\n\n<$A> \n\nI you know going to to religion 'cause I I 'm I\n\n<$B> \n\nReligion\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I I met I mean I I met a lot of people in the past no different different uh uhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWalks of life\n\n<$A> \n\nWalks of life and different uhm uh religious beliefs\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd uh\n\n<$B> \n\nHinduism Buddhism  \n\n<$A> \n\n  Uhm a  \n\n<$B> \n\n Such as   \n\n<$A> \n\nNo mostly in the Philippines  \n\n<$B> \n\n Mostly in the Philippines but there are foreigners here  \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah but uh\n\n<$B> \n\nFilipinos\n\n<$A> \n\nFilipinos\n\n<$B> \n\n  Okay  \n\n<$A> \n\n And they   have they really have different ways of uh expressing their religious beliefs\n\n\nAnd of course uhm I really am not uh against or for these groups but what 's important is to me uhm for when a person chooses his  his or her religion is if he or she uhm uh watchacall it uhm uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n  Believing sometimes  \n\n<$A> \n\n Wholeheartedly   \n\n\nYes he must he or she must be wholeheartedly uhm active in   in that work  \n\n<$B> \n\n In that belief   \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah in that belief",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nYeah but there was a script\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat script\n\n<$A> \n\nRemember the time when I had to record something for Equitable P C I Bank\n\n\nThere was a script\n\n<$B> \n\nIt was not Equitable P C I Bank at that time\n\n<$A> \n\nNo it wasn't\n\n<$B> \n\nNo it was called Equitable Banking Corporation\n\n<$A> \n\nOh is that right\n\n\nWhat ever did you do with that recording I never heard about it again, \n\n<$B> \n\nI didn't hear anything about it and you know\n\n<$A> \n\nThey didn't like it\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I think, I don't think it 's because they didn't like it\n\n\nThey were they were a little shy to they were a little embarrassed to ask you to come back 'cause there were things that they would like to to do again\n\n\nLike uhm maybe put more pauses or something like that\n\n\nJust put more pauses or maybe put some more or maybe to try another way to record your voice because they used another they were thinking of doing something else for, putting the, the voice recording into a digital format\n\n<$A> \n\nAll right\n\n<$B> \n\nActually that that project is not was never used\n\n\nIt hasn't been used 'cause when it was done the bank had to merge with P C I already\n\n\nSo we just  tried it on we just tried the program with maybe one class and they had to pick out certain uh items like the history of the bank was not taken up\n\n\nI don't remember exactly 'cause at the time when they wanted to reprogram or re- uh uh how do you call this remake or do the recording again I was already on training\n\n\nSo they looked for somebody else to record the the voice part\n\n\nSo and because there was already a merging of the new bank you know of the two banks they had to re-design the program\n\n\nNow we have a new training program for that the new orientation but they have taken out the history and the functional you know descriptions I 'm sorry the descriptions of the functional the functions of the the organizations\n\n<$A> \n\nBut it was still going to be used for orientation right\n\n\nSo they decided   to  make a new program for orientation   and then  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n There 's still   an orientation\n\n\nActually it 's been running\n\n\nSome of the modules are are used like ah like the parts for customer service parts about values orientation uh and the security\n\n\nBut about the the bank 's organization  itself it is not it was not done on any electronic medium\n\n\nThey just asked somebody you know from the human resources division to  describe or to talk about the organization and the history because right now everything is in transition\n\n\nSo we still don't know how to, how to put it in anything permanent like an or something electronic because it would be difficult for us to edit or re-edit or to call the artists again because nothing is final yet\n\n\nIt 's still in transition\n\n\nA lot of the uh units of the bank are still integrated especially the branches\n\n\nSo anything about its history except for the fact that it 's already on the fiftieth year  e  most of the things are still you know are still they 're not floating but it 's still moving and it 's still and it 's still how do you call this it 's still going through changes\n\n\nSo a lot of the personnel are still being moved around there 's still re-deployment\n\n\nWe are taking in new officers we are taking in new you know new employees at the at the lowest level\n\n\nActually we 're open for hiring\n\n<$A> \n\nBut then all the more you need like a program   for orienting  \n\n<$B> \n\n This is a nice sofa   \n\n\nWhat\n\n<$A> \n\nAll the more you need uh like a program to orient these people that you 're taking in\n\n\nFor example to take uh for the new officers of P C I Bank to be integrated to the new bank Equitable tradition or whatever that is\n\n\nSo all the more you need that program to orient them as to how Equitable started and who the uh who are heading up the different divisions\n\n\nThat 's what I remember from the   recording  that we did a long time ago\n\n<$B> \n\n It   oh but in terms of how to integrate the organization itself the bank saw it more fitting or how do you call this it seems to be more  appropriate to explain what the bank stands for to explain what are the values work values\n\n\nWhat the logo stands for what are why do we have these five elements why do we what are we espousing as an organization\n\n\nUh I think the bank saw it as more appropriate to explain especially to those who are not part of the former Equitable Banking Corporation\n\n\nSo what we do right now is just describe what the logo the colorful logo means\n\n\nWhat is how do you how can you say that the corporate values can be translated or can be uh done in in your work place or as you work\n\n\nSo but the history itself or like what are the different organization units are as I said everything is still going through changes\n\n\nThere 's a lot of things that are still happening so what we are doing right now is focusing more on the on what the bank stands for the values that we espouse the vision of the bank\n\n\nBasically that 's it\n\n\nAren't you getting bored with this conversation\n\n\nAren't we supposed to talk about something else\n\n\nSomething nicer something how do you call it more interesting\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no 'cause I was thinking about how proud I was to be the voice talent of   Equitable  P C I Bank\n\n<$B> \n\n I know   \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd I was you were I remember you telling me that you 're gonna come out with commercials and stuff like that\n\n\nAnd that maybe you know if they like my voice maybe they would take my voice as the uh for the commercial that you 're gonna be coming out with\n\n\nAnd I was really looking forward to that not so much because uh first time I was ever gonna be a voice talent\n\n<$B> \n\nThere 's a lot of things that 's really going on a lot\n\n\nBefore we had the integration also of the two banks\n\n\nWe had tried I and the other you know other employees tried to we had an audition you know for the voice for the electronic banking.\n\n<$A> \n\nHow come you   didn't call me  for that\n\n<$B> \n\n You know like for the   \n\n\nI don't think it was for the\n\n\nNo they were looking only for people within the organization and it was not under our unit\n\n<$A> \n\n  Oh  \n\n<$B> \n\n It   was not our project\n\nit was a project of another unit\n\n\nSo they were  you know they just wrote down whoever could be available or something like that\n\n<$A> \n\nDidn't you try out for that\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I did\n\n\nLike like \" press eight for deposit press nine for withdrawal press \" you know \" press zero \" or something like that so\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you get the job\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't think the the plan pushed through 'cause because of the integration\n\n\nP C I already had that I think\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you 're just gonna adapt whatever it is that they have\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah actually we are using a lot of the things that P C I had before a long time\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I want to be the voice talent\n\n\nIs there any audition coming up anytime soon   for whatever  \n\n<$B> \n\n Well I 'm sure   they 're going to make like new videos\n\n\nIf you like you can also uh be involved in that\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah keep me in mind\n\n\nI don't know it 's just that it was a lot of fun\n\n\nI had a great time recording that that time that that was like what three days if I 'm not mistaken\n\n\nUhm I had a lot of fun recording and I was really looking forward to like seeing the real thing like\n\n<$B> \n\nSeeing the the\n\n<$A> \n\nYou said there was going   be like  \n\n<$B> \n\n The output   \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah visuals and there was going to be I don't know you told me there was gonna be a lot of things that they 're going to integrate my voice into the program\n\n\nAnd I was like really looking forward to that I wanted to see how all these things come about\n\n\nI 've never had any experience in video production or in program-making or whatever this was the first time\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm not sure if the if the slide presentation was done\n\n\nThe audiovisual material is finished or completed already\n\n\nI do know that because they had to re-do you know the voice-recording\n\n\nThey asked Queenie to tape to go through the recording to do the recording rather\n\n<$A> \n\nI know there 's a lot of things that I have to learn about that\n\n\nThe pauses that you were talking about and of course my S 's I think are too pronounced\n\n\nEven when I was singing for the choir at Saint Cyprian 's that was the one thing that my director would always caution me about uhm my S 's are too pronounced\n\n\nAnd I guess when you 're recording\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't think there 's anything wrong with your S 's\n\n<$A> \n\nOh is that right\n\n<$B> \n\nWell\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you   listen  to that taping   again  \n\n<$B> \n\n You see   \n\n\n You see   it 's different\n\n\nI have listened I have heard the the voice recording but I don't really remember exactly the details\n\n\nMaybe I should ask Kitty to look for it so that you you can hear and listen to it\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'd be too embarrassed   though  \n\n<$B> \n\n I do   know that we placed it in C D\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I wanna see I I wanna \n\n\nSee that 's what I wanna see that 's what I wanna hear especially if you integrated the visuals 'cause I wanna see how what you were gonna do with it\n\n\nI was very curious about that\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's very easy I can show you now how you do it, \n\n\nOh   but but from  transferring  \n\n<$A> \n\n No but my voice   yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nTransferring your voice from the magnetic tape   to a  digital one\n\n<$A> \n\n That 's right   \n\n\nThat 's right\n\n<$B> \n\nOh we have a different uh software for that\n\n<$A> \n\nThen and then you integrate it with the visuals and I want to see you know I wanna hear my voice and then I wanna see what kind of visuals you come up with\n\n\nLike see the whole thing the whole project\n\n<$B> \n\nI will ask Kitty 'cause I do know that it was already finished\n\n<$A> \n\nOh is that right\n\n<$B> \n\nYes they 're already using it\n\n<$A> \n\nBut you 're not gonna use it huh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it 's not your voice that was used   because they had to  \n\n<$A> \n\n It 's not my voice   \n\n<$B> \n\nNo they had to do the recording I 've been saying all  since the beginning\n\n<$A> \n\nSee I want to see the whole thing and my voice\n\n\nSee I keep emphasizing my voice because I wanted like my friends my my family members   my old teachers could hear it  \n\n<$B> \n\n They did not use your voice as far as I know   they did not use your voice\n\n<$A> \n\nNow I 'm sad\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm sorry\n\n<$A> \n\nI know\n\n\nYeah 'cause Becky was asking about it too\n\n\nAnd of course she 's seeing all the commercials about you know Equitable P C I Bank on television these days and she goes well I thought you know that you were being considered for that \n\n\nAnd I said well I thought so too but I guess they decided to go another way \n\n\nShe said well she goes what happened to that voice uh the tape right that you did for them like a year ago or something \n\n\nAnd I said I don't really know uhm I 'm gonna have to ask about it \n\n<$B> \n\nThey did not use your voice  because there were parts you see some of the things that you said were like in full paragraphs   right  \n\n<$A> \n\n That 's   right\n\n<$B> \n\nWe found out that although you would stop at particular points\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nWe found out that those paragraphs took so long\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nWe couldn't cut them\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nIn the middle\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nWhile you were talking on the recording\n\n\nWe couldn't stop or just cut it there\n\n\nWe found out that we had to record again\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n<$B> \n\nBut since again as I said a while ago I was already on training they were a little shy I think they were embarrassed to call you again for free\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nSince you did it for free\n\n\nThey and you were you know somebody outside of the company they didn't want to risk that\n\n\nAnd then uh see if you were working for the bank it is understood that you might get it you know you might do it for free but then we pay you for overtime\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I see\n\n<$B> \n\nYou can file for overtime\n\n\nBut in your case you 're a you know you 're not a member of the organization you were uh you were just doing you were  just doing this you know as a favor\n\n\nBut my boss doesn't like those things where you know doing something for favors\n\n<$A> \n\nI wish I could have told her that it was enough for me to like   to like   \n\n<$B> \n\n See the whole   production\n\n<$A> \n\nSee the whole production\n\n\nYou know that was just something that I was really interested in and that was just something that I know would be like a once in a lifetime experience it 's not my line of work  \n\n\nWhere I am at right now I don't think I 'm ever gonna be able to do something like that again\n\n\nSo I was like that would have been really neat\n\n\nAt any rate I 'm sorry", "subdomain":

\n\n<$A> \n\nKinematics\n\n<$B> \n\nInstructions or Kinematics of Machine and Machine Elements \n\n<$A> \n\nWow that 's really something\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's a teaching aid  ,  to you know uhm  to\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nFor Mechanical students\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah for them  \n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's why I never really took up any engineering course\n\n\nI know I 'll just flunk in all my subjects\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause I 'm not good in Math\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's why I thank God we don't have any Math subjects anymore, for this term, \n\n<$B> \n\nUhm, anyway uhm anyway we 're  anyway we 're almost done in our thesis and\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's good\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah, seventy-five percent\n\n<$A> \n\nWas finished\n\n<$B> \n\nIs finished\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm, good

opened it and it 's a very very  it 's well well done, \n\n\nSo it is beautiful \n\n<$A> \n\n Great Britain   \n\n\nYeah\n\n\nI mean they have to do it right if they 're going to start and pioneer the whole thing Dan\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's beautiful\n\n\nBut I I just have a comment on their, syntactic trees\n\n\nUh maybe it 's not the the trees are not really trees  e  \n\n\n  They 're  linear\n\n\nThe the analysis of the constituents of their sentences, in the   corpus  is is linear\n\n\nSo you know their it is like parsing or   <unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n\nSo it 's not really trees   because in the trees you have subsets  \n\n<$A> \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n As in one, you have subsets   \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n\nAnd you can see the you know know what what they call the dominant relations, you know, \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah, \n\n\nSo\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's well done\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n\nAt least well you should be able to get some data from that for the presentation, \n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm for the intro\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n\nI I haven't I haven't sat down yet to do mine but I should, I should be able to\n\n\nAnyway we each only have  what   each of us has  ten fifteen minutes, \n\n<$B> \n\n</> Ten   \n\n\nDid you see my e-mail  \n\n<$A> \n\nYou have to submit your handouts uhm at at the latest at the day before a day before the presentation which means Tuesday\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat\n\n<$B> \n\nI got a call from Jocelyn Jocelyn\n\n<$A> \n\nIf we 're coming for Ching 's, chair lecture\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm, \n\n<$A> \n\nBesides, I 've been thinking though except for that one list of categories that Tish wanted me to have as a handout that people can bring with them, the rest are going to be on acetate and so I was thinking of just doing it myself, \n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm but I told her we need an O H P\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n\nAre you gonna 'cause you 're gonna use one\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nBut yeah I 'll use one, \n\n\nOff hand I was thinking of having, list of categories\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's one acetate\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm, \n\n<$A> \n\nHeader what what are the things that are contained in the header\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A> \n\nJust to give them an idea that they can have background information about the kind of <unclear> words </unclear> or the persons they are, listening to in the tape\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd, sample text so that they know when I say just ignore the markups then they don't say what are the markups\n\n\nThen I 'd say these are the markups, \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd  those will be on uh on acetates\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I want to do them, on acetates, \n\n\nI don't wanna do handouts a lot when I discuss 'cause people don't listen\n\n\nIs it the same for you\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah, \n\n<$A> \n\nSo we 're okay with that\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThe other thing, \n\n\nCan we talk about the, the FUSE, the trip\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nOh can I ask you\n\n<$B> \n\nUh yeah the the schedule has been changed\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat do you mean\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's still in May but uhm it would be one week later\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it 's going to be May, \n\n\nThe the original the first schedule was May one to May   seven  \n\n<$A> \n\n Seven   \n\n<$B> \n\nNow it 's going to be May seven to May thirteen\n\n\nReason since the secretaries are coming along  ,  one of them has to be here to be left behind\n\n\nUh and Coolly said we can't afford to you know to close the the   office  for one week  'no  \n\n\nSo one has to be left behind\n\n\nAnd that means that Paz 's group will go to Cagayan de Oro first week of May\n\n\nWe will go to Palawan second week\n\n\nThird week uh Coolly 's group will go to Iloilo, \n\n\nThat 's three weeks in May\n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\n Office   \n\n\nIs it okay if I ask about the, honorarium in regards to a personal plan I have\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know how we 're given the honorarium right as in eight thousand but with the daily allowance how are you planning to do that like we did in Davao\n\n\nWe we will you give us each our budget for the meal and the, lodging\n\n\nYou know how you had <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nThe the the the one that we did in Surigao was was something different\n\n<$A> \n\nHow how did you\n\n<$B> \n\nIf you still remember in Davao, we shouldered our own expenses for food and accommodation\n\n\nI think in Surigao, we had free lunch\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nFree everything is free except the breakfast because we stayed in a hotel\n\n\nBut otherwise the lunch and the, the dinner\n\n<$A> \n\nBut are we gonna liquidate the accommodation and meal, money\n\n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nThe one that, it 's the allowance that 's not liquidated I 'm not sure\n\n\nThe honorarium   is  \n\n<$A> \n\n Dan   can you find out because, for me if it 's not  pera  because, uhm, I was thinking and and you 're invited too if you want but if you don't have to liquidate the the accommodation and meal allowance  ,  can you just give it to us and then I was I was planning to stay in the house and not in the hotel \n\n<$B> \n\n Uhm  , \n\n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThen if you want you can come, they can come\n\n\nIt 's just that of course it 's gonna be more, luxurious and you know  ,  better facility\n\n\nBecause I I wanted to do that 'cause I wanted to save because I Roel and the kids are planning to come the week after we 're there \n\n<$B> \n\n Busy   \n\n\nUh okay, \n\n\nSo are you staying on or\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nUh staying on\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah that 's what we wanted to do because we were gonna go to Subic in March\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nBut then when I said, oh I 'm going to Palawan and I don't have a choice, \n\n<$B> \n\nWhat you should do then is tell Nilda, that your return ticket\n\n<$A> \n\nWould be one week later\n\n<$B> \n\nOne week later  oo , \n\n\n'Cause I gave her the new date May seven to May thirteen\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you wanna stay longer, \n\n<$B> \n\nNo, one week 's okay\n\n\nUh and then so uh uh I 'll look into that\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'll look into that\n\n<$A> \n\nThat is is you know\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause yeah I remember in Surigao one the allowance I think was not liquidated but the one which had which was taxed was liquidated I 'm not sure it 's the other way around\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm, \n\n\nAny news yet on the, MOA\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n\nThe  MATEL\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm C O E\n\n<$B> \n\nThey have the money\n\n\nIt was released yesterday and Nilda got a notice from the accounting office that the point five million  ,  is already available\n\n\nIt 's it 's already been deposited in the accounting office\n\n\nSo I made it clear to her that that 's just the first installment because it 's one million per year  e  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd CHED might say that it 's just point five million for one year but uh Nilda said no it 's just the first installment second installment will, will come very soon\n\n\nI I have not talked to Coolly about that yet\n\n\nBut it 's a, it 's a development a great development because we 've been waiting for that  ,  since last year\n\n\nSo it 's all it 's all systems go for the MATEL \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nDo we have the faculty though, \n\n<$B> \n\nWe have identified them\n\n\nThe thing however is that we haven't talked to to people and we haven't given them the schedule\n\n<$A> \n\nWho do you have in mind to teach\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat\n\n<$A> \n\nThe C O E MATEL\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm the usual faculty graduate faculty plus you Cora uh and Lily might go might be asked to go uhm Remy Miciano also\n\n\nI think we have enough except that we have to synchronize the I mean you know to see the the schedule and not hold the courses at the same time\n\n\nThat 's why I, the first reaction to the MOA uh the P H D Applied Linguistics extension program in Ateneo was a little negative\n\n\nI said, I I go for deferment of the project to the following year because we might be understaffed\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIf all the the extension programs namely Lipa Zamboanga and the MATEL uh C O E  projects uhm are held at the same   time  on schedule I mean you know same schedule then we might be left with no one to teach the courses on campus\n\n\nAnd we have three masters and one P H D courses in on campus \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nIf if I 'll be teaching the MATEL I 'll I 'll be going to San Carlos, or that   depends on the  course\n\n<$B> \n\n We 're not sure about   San Carlos yet   'cause  I haven't talked \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh all right   \n\n\nAnd it depends on the course and not so much on the place\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat course were you thinking for me to teach\n\n<$B> \n\nI was thinking of giving you Advanced Grammar for Philippine Languages  \n\n\nNo I think you were identified for to teach curriculum design something on materials prep\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nThe one that Andee has been teaching\n\n<$A> \n\nAll right, \n\n\nThat 's exciting but Ateneo de Zamboanga at the moment is being deferred\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nUh   it 's all systems go  also\n\n<$B> \n\n It 's all systems go   \n\n\nYeah yeah I didn't finish the statement Allan said Allan e-mailed me back and said Danny if we defer to the following year then they might look for  another school\n\n<$A> \n\nRight but\n\n<$B> \n\nWe might lose the chance of you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nServing that\n\n<$A> \n\nBut where I 'm not I 'm not teaching there right, \n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nJust so I can pace myself if I can go to Europe or Africa\n\n<$B> \n\nWhere in Africa in Rwanda  \n\n<$A> \n\nNo but you know Roel 's going to Australia in September but I don't know\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm Olympic Olympic  'no  \n\n<$A> \n\nThey have the International Pig Veterinary Society\n\n<$B> \n\nOlympic and the Olympic month\n\n<$A> \n\nEvery two years they have this meeting the last time was in when I gave birth to Audrey he was in Italy\n\n\nThen when that year I went to England two weeks before that he was in Birmingham\n\n<$B> \n\nWow\n\n<$A> \n\nThat was his conference and then I went to Plymouth\n\n\nNow it 's in Sydney\n\n<$B> \n\nWow\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I 'm not saying anything yet 'cause he hasn't said if he 's bringing me but, I want to go  \n\n\nBut you know but come to think of it I have so many trips this year\n\n\nWell many than usual anyway <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nSo we have I 'm going to did I uh I haven't told you I 'm going to Cebu\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen\n\n<$A> \n\nOn March four\n\n<$B> \n\nFor\n\n<$A> \n\nTentatively eighty percent going\n\n<$B> \n\nFor\n\n<$A> \n\nMy grandparents have arrived from the States\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I 'm staying until only until the sixth\n\n\nSo after my class with Tish I 'm leaving\n\n\nUhm, I yet have to wait for their call on Monday before I finalize everything but so far uh as far as I 'm concerned I 'm going there

\n\nI see, \n\n<$A> \n\nWell I don't\n\n<$B> \n\nDo you\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't\n\n<$B> \n\nDo you call this a discussion\n\n<$C> \n\nI suppose so\n\n<$B> \n\nNo it isn't\n\n<$C> \n\nYes it is\n\n<$A> \n\nI think so\n\n<$B> \n\nIt is not\n\n<$C> \n\nYes it is\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's not\n\n\nNo of course not\n\n<$C> \n\nYes it is\n\n<$B> \n\nCome on let 's have a discussion\n\n<$A> \n\nBugger off Jimmy\n\n<$C> \n\nStop it stop it\n\n<$B> \n\nVictor cool it will you\n\n\nI 'm trying to sip on this coffee\n\n\nHow many more minutes to go\n\n<$C> \n\nPerhaps now we can begin uh, if you feel it is appropriate\n\n<$A> \n\nSo Jimmy what do you think about this issue that McIntyre\ntalks about in \" After Virtue \" \n\n<$B> \n\nInteresting\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's a very boring answer Jimmy, \n\n\nYou 're not risking anything by saying that\n\n<$B> \n\nExciting\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's very boring, as well\n\n<$B> \n\nWell remember what I told you in the faculty canteen\n\n\nYou made me think about something else <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$C> \n\nYeah like\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah you know like he starts off by saying by giving out all\nthe examples <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nCan you speak up please I can't hear you\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd why there seems to be no standard by which to weigh the\nrival premise of the other\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you remember what I replied to that theory of yours\n\n<$B> \n\nNot quite\n\n<$A> \n\nI said it was just a load of senseless drivel,  totally incoherent  and absolutely\nwanting in sense\n\n<$B> \n\nWell you see that 's your opinion\n\n<$A> \n\nWell that 's that you 're taking the  emotivist  \nposition right now Jimmy\n\n\nThe point is how\n\n<$B> \n\nSo how can we say who is right\n\n\nHow do we overcome the incommensurability of these uh-hum premises\n\n<$A> \n\nMore premises\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I think we have to discover the  luminon\n\n huh\n\n<$A> \n\nWell\n\n<$B> \n\nThen we 'll have the rational basis\n\n\nBut then again it 's unknown so what the heck right, the\n\n luminon  aha\n\n<$A> \n\nThe  luminon  is dead\n\n<$B> \n\nThe  luminon  \n\n<$A> \n\nWell no need to drift into this  luminon  \nrealm of reality Mr Guevara\n\n<$B> \n\nYes Dr Brias I suppose you 're very right about that\n\n<$C> \n\nSo where do we drift into\n\n<$A> \n\nOh Prof Guevara\n\n\nTake Freudian example you might say we might be drifting back into\nthe , excuse me uh but uh jokes aside, please continue\nwith your theoretical expos\u00e9\n\n<$B> \n\nBut as of now they 're very incoherent\n\n<$C> \n\nWhich \" they \" \n\n<$B> \n\nMy ideas I guess\n\n\nHow many more minutes to go\n\n<$A> \n\nHey uh Jimmy should I say Prof Guevara since this is a\nserious   discussion  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yes yes   Dr Brias what is it, \n\n<$A> \n\nDon't you think that life is beautiful\n\n\nAren't these beautiful feelings so wonderful, \n\n\nDon't you just feel like rising up jumping and saying \" \npraise the Lord hallelujah I 'm saved \" \n\n<$B> \n\nYes I do Victor I really do I mean I believe in God you know\n\n<$A> \n\nPoint well taken  \n\n<$C> \n\nWhat a life\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat do you think Jimmy\n\n<$B> \n\nYes but a woman has a right to her own body\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah of course\n\n\nThat means if she 's pregnant, does she uh does that mean she\nis permitted to abort the baby that she has\n\n<$B> \n\nAhh good point, \n\n\nYou think uh you think that a woman is only as old as the man she\nfeels\n\n<$C> \n\nAs a what, \n\n<$B> \n\nI 'll repeat the question\n\n\nYou think a woman is only as old as the man she feels, \n\n<$A> \n\nOr to say that chauvinistically do you think the man is only\nas old as the woman he feels\n\n<$B> \n\nI think that is said more appropriately now Dr Brias\n\n<$A> \n\nI think so\n\n\nHey Jimmy could you ask your wife to cut her nails my back 's a\nmess  \n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's a good joke Vic good joke\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know Jimmy 's wife likes to talk while she has sex so she\ncalled him up the other day from her hotel room\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then what happened\n\n<$A> \n\nYou tell us , \n\n\nI believe that God is everywhere\n\n<$B> \n\nWhere\n\n<$A> \n\nEverywhere\n\n<$B> \n\nWhere 's that\n\n<$A> \n\nAll around\n\n<$B> \n\nWhere 's all around, in heaven and in hell as St Augustine\nwould say\n\n<$A> \n\n  You know  \n\n<$B> \n\n Is he   in you also\n\n<$A> \n\nI suppose so\n\n\nYeah, anyway getting to more serious matters\n\n<$B> \n\nHey Leny I hope this thing works for whatever you wanna do\nwith it huh\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah, Leny I I hope it works well\n\n<$B> \n\nFive forty-five\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't think I 'll ever, be happy\n\n<$C> \n\nWhat 's Leny taking Literature for\n\n<$B> \n\nUh 'cause she likes writing she likes lit she enjoys it\n\n<$C> \n\nShe 's studying, she 's studying\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah her doctorate program\n\n<$C> \n\nAhh her doctorate program\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah here at La Salle\n\n<$C> \n\nI see\n\n\nWhat 's it on I mean what what program what program is she on\nthere\n\n<$B> \n\nAll I know is D A Lit Doctor of Arts or something\n\n<$C> \n\nLit\n\n<$B> \n\nHey Dante are you getting a ride from me today or should I\nsay are you gonna drive yourself home with me on, the right side\n\n\nDante 's my driver\n\n<$A> \n\nReally\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah when he rides with me he drives\n\n\nHe feels too nervous when I drive\n\n<$C> \n\nLet 's have another cup of coffee\n\n<$B> \n\nYou go ahead\n\n<$A> \n\nYes Jimmy will buy the next round so\n\n<$C> \n\nThanks Jim\n\n<$B> \n\nIn fact order a piece of cake too  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh waitress\n\n<$B> \n\nUh Vic she 's not a waitress, actually\n\n<$C> \n\nThis guy is the waitress  \n\n<$B> \n\nIn fact he 's a waiter or so we think  \n\n<$A> \n\nHe seems like a waiter but he may be a waitress  \n\n\nDeep inside in the very core of his being is a little woman dying\nto come out  \n\n<$C> \n\nAhh coffee\n\n<$A> \n\nYes please\n\n<$C> \n\nEnough\n\n<$A> \n\nEnough\n\n<$B> \n\nDid you take Marcel in Louvain\n\n<$A> \n\nI took Valium , and marijuana  \n\n<$C> \n\nPatty Valium\n\n<$A> \n\nIvan Demerol\n\n<$C> \n\nMegadon\n\n<$A> \n\nSorsogon\n\n<$B> \n\nAmphetamines\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd occasionally I did take a dose of  Xylocybi  for\nthat uh pseudo-mystical experience, \n\n<$B> \n\nI wonder if this thing turns off automatically\n\n<$A> \n\n \n\n<$B> \n\nI didn't know you knew how to speak Thai\n\n<$A> \n\nNo this is Baluchistani  \n\n<$C> \n\nYeah you talk Baluchistani after all\n\n<$A>  \n\n\nIn fact when I was in Louvain I used to speak Baluchistani with\nthis guy Old Victor, Old Victor Kevin O'Brien and even Mark O'Brien Kevin\nO'Brien 's brother\n\n\nSo uh Old Victor really got into Baluchistani and uh he uh he well\nas Wolf would say his is already a case of advanced what was it what was it\n, ahh psychosis no not psychosis, schizophrenia\n\n<$B> \n\nSchizophrenia\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd uh Old Victor had this vocabulary\n\n\nSo we had to learn it <unclear> foreign words </unclear> and then\nnumbers we had numbers uh <unclear> foreign words </unclear> \n\n<$C> \n\nAll numbers\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's the only thing I remembered from my first lessons in\nBaluchistani\n\n<$B> \n\nBaluchistani\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd we would go to this bar, it was called uh Jesus Christ\nwhat was it called\n\n\nIt was called uh uh, now I forget I used to hang out in this\nplace called the Metropole\n\n\nAnd it was right across the street it was uh it was really the bar\nof these uh people from  Limburgh  \n\n\nAnd it was really a very packed bar it was uh it was uh Old Victor\nwould call it a hetero bar\n\n\nYou see it 's one of the few bars you could actually go to pick up\ngirls, and uh, it was kind of funny 'cause uh we would always start\nspeaking Baluchistani\n\n\nIt was always packed, this place was always packed\n\n\nAnd we would all start speaking Baluchistani and then people would\nalways listen to us\n\n<$C> \n\nReally\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah they thought we were speaking, 'cause you know Old\nVictor did it really well like <unclear> words </unclear> Old Victor would\nthrow in Flemish\n\n\nOld Victor was my friend Victor van Fracken he 's an older guy so\nI used to call him Old Vic  ,  I was Young Vic\n\n\nAnyway Old Vic he he would always speak  he would throw in these words you\nknow\n\n\nWell he must have been schizophrenic you know\n\n\nAnd we 'd have a good laugh\n\n<$C> \n\n Ahh   \n\n\nDid anyone uh ask where you 're from\n\n<$A> \n\nIf we 're asked where we were from they would ask where we\nwere from Old Vic would always say uh, excuse me I don't speak English so\nwell\n\n\nHe was Flemish actually but he would always act like a foreigner\nwith the Flemish people  you know and he always\npulled he was a real actor you know Old Vic was\n\n\nHe was a bit like Manfred actually uh in that sense\n\n\nHe could uh really play these roles huh and uh he he really\nenjoyed himself when he did\n\n\nHe was uh, he never finished his studies\n\n\nHe he studied Germanic uh no Slavistics actually, he never\nfinished   <unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n<$C> \n\n Doctorate   \n\n<$A> \n\nNo, he never finished his degree, college degree\n\n<$C> \n\nOh yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nWell he was a cab driver and uh he used to hang around\n\n\nHe was a bum and he started studying bookkeeping no\n\n\nSee now he 's forty-five or something you know <unclear> word\n\n</unclear> for his future you know\n\n<$C> \n\nHe wants to be a bookkeeper\n\n<$A> \n\nHuh\n\n<$C> \n\nHe wants to be a bookkeeper\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah, an accountant so he would always start telling me\nabout how important accounting and bookkeeping is you know  \n\n\nOld Victor was a funny guy, Flemish, \n\n\nAnd uh he liked to dance very much\n\n\nSo this place he 'd always get these girls and start dancing and\ntalking to them in Baluchistani you know  \n\n\nI have pictures of Old Vic, and I 'll show you my pictures\nsomeday\n\n\nI haven't showed them to you yet all the people I know\n\n<$B> \n\nI I saw Kevin you showed me the picture of Kevin\n\n<$A> \n\nThose were the last pictures I took before I left\n\n<$B> \n\nBut that was I think after your defense or something\n\n\nKevin 's tall he 's about what six-two\n\n<$A> \n\nHe must be about six six feet\n\n<$B> \n\nSo what he 's back in Canada and he 's teaching in a\nuniversity\n\n<$A> \n\nNo, no he 's working as uh as a business analyst\n\n<$B> \n\nAhh\n\n<$A> \n\nIn a biology company\n\n<$B> \n\nBut he 's got a P H D in Philosophy you know that 's\ninteresting\n\n<$A> \n\nHe 's very smart he 's a smart guy  1 10", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c2a2212c-d246-4a8d-bfcc-16fa31a76640", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.036622+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nHow are you\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm fine\n\n\nI 'm always fine\n\n<$A> \n\nOh really\n\n\nNice of you to be fine\n\n\nYou don't have a class anymore\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't have a class since it is my break time\n\n<$A> \n\nOh is that so\n\n\nSo what was your last class\n\n<$B> \n\nMy last class well \" Technical Writing \"\n\n<$A> \n\nOh what is it all about\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat is it all about\n\n\nIsn't it that you are teaching \" Technical Writing\n\"\n\n\nSo why do you still have to ask me\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yeah just kidding\n\n\nYou know I 'm almost <unclear> words </unclear> exhausted    <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nSorry\n\n<$B> \n\n You 're joking me  \n\n\nIf there is somebody who is going to ask about \" Technical\nWriting \" it should be me since sometime uh uh  ano \nso that I could even   <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A>  Yeah yeah yeah yeah I understand that  \n\n\nBut anyway what part of \" Technical Writing \" I\nmean uh the course outline have you tackled already\n\n<$B> \n\nI 've tackled already so far we have talked about uhm the\ndefinition\n\n<$A> \n\n  Okay \n\n<$B> \n\n We talked about   the properties\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n\nHow many properties did you talk about\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I could not remember everything anymore but I made sure\nthat I was able to talk about the properties starting with \" A\n\" up to mention> Z \"\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I believe that well in my own understanding since you know\nI 'm also teaching the subject right\n\n\nI think the properties are very important isn't it\n\n\nWhat do you think\n\n<$B> \n\nIt is very important that 's why I told them that they 're not\nsupposed to memorize it only but you also have to apply all the things that\nyou have learned from the properties\n\n<$A> \n\nMe too\n\n\nWe have the same you know you know okay\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat else well what we are going to talk about right now\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> ask questions about pertaining this\nsubject because I 'm not that knowledgeable\n\n<$A> \n\nSure anything\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I 'm gonna we are going to talk about properties what\nelse other things that we are supposed to talk\n\n<$A> \n\n\nWell I believe that you have to proceed now with the basic uh\ntechniques because these basic techniques support your lesson in properties\n\n\nYou know uhm properties actually the concept of studying the\nproperties is, to achieve appropriateness\n\n\nNow in line with appropriateness we have to see to it that the\nstudents may also know how to achieve appropriateness\n\n\nSo I advise you  ha  I advise you to tackle the\nbasic techniques before the prelim exam\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you have do you have a note on that\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't have a note but then whatever are the things that I 'm\nteaching about \" Technical Writing \" I usually refer it to\n<,> from from my two sources which are uhm the \" Basic Technical\nCommunication \"\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n\nOh yeah\n\n\nThat 's like a book that 's   that 's a nice book \n\n\nSorry\n\n<$B> \n\n <unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n\nSo I consider that to be a reference book in this subject\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes sure\n\n\nThe other one how about the other one\n\n<$B> \n\nThe other one I forgot the title uh,\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's here   \" Technical Writing \" \n\n<$B> \n\n \" Technical Writing \"   by\n<unclear> word </unclear>  Soria and Mogol  <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nThat 's also nice\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah it seems complete\n\n<$B> \n\nWell so far I don't have any difficulty teaching yet because\nwe haven't tackled yet those uhm difficult things that need to be tackled\nabout\n\n<$A> \n\n  Okay \n\n<$B> \n\n So   at this point in time I 'm still having some\ntime uh teaching about that because it 's quite easy at this very moment\n\n<$A> \n\nWell if you find some difficulties in the future just, if\nyou need my help just approach me okay\n\n\nWho knows I may able to help you with that okay\n\n\nSo let 's help one another\n\n<$B> \n\nOne one more thing apart from apart from uhm those things that\nI 'm supposed to teach them\n\n\nWhat do you think are the best projects that I should require the\nstudents   <unclear> words </unclear>  to apply the properties\nthat they have learned   from this  subject\n\n<$A> \n\nOh  that 's a nice question  \n\n\n Okay  \n\n\nUh for me uhm they have only one project for that subject\n\n\nThey 're going to bring a finished product\n\n\nA finished product which they did not buy from the market\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat do you mean by that\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay uh one of the basic techniques that we will tackle is\nabout description of a process\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay now in that description of a process you will be learning\nthe different procedures to finish something\n\n\nNow uh in line with that I am requiring my students to bring with\nthem a finished product but this finished product which will be their project\nis related to their course like for instance uh, uh, a, wall\ndecoration or a lamp\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd they could try to assemble that using the so called\nmaterials so our agreement is this they can buy the materials from the market\nbut they need to produce their own\n\n\nThey have to come up with a lamp or they may have to come up with a\nwall decoration or they should come up with an electrical project anything\nthat has something to do with reports and this may be the application of all\nthe things that they learned in \" Technical Writing \"\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause in the matter of presentation they have to apply unity\ncoherence organization and of course logic\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so\n\n<$A> \n\nThat is one project that actually I only require them to\nsubmit one project  e \n\n<$B> \n\nBut apart from uhm apart from the requirement that they are to\nsupposed to pass\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nAre are they supposed to also explain about that particular\n  project \n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   definitely they have they have to explain it\nthey have to to present to the class the methods that they followed the\nmaterials that they used okay and then the way they  assembled\nthat particular project\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat about the proposals\n\n\nWhat can you say about that\n\n<$A> \n\nIn terms of proposal because you know there is already this uh\nthis trend right now that they are not making their own proposal\n\n\nThey just they are just asking somebody else to do it for them\n\n\nSo in terms of proposal I am not sure whether they can finish that\nor they do this all by themselves or they just ask somebody else to do it for\nthem\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you you feel then that it is not good for you to require\nthem to make a proposal\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's not that it is not good but I think it 's not the best\nway of knowing whether they learn something from \" Technical Writing\n\" or not\n\n\nBut you can also do that provided provided  ha  take\nnote of this provided that these students will be doing their proposal inside\nthe classroom\n\n\nBut the problem is how can they gather data,\n\n<$B> \n\nSo meaning you still have to send them out   for for\ndata gathering \n\n<$A> \n\n Yes  \n\n\nAnd then they have to show me the gathered data\n\n<$B> \n\nBut then from my own point of view uh if there 's one thing\nthat they should really learn about is on how to make a proposal\n\n<$A> \n\n  Yes of course \n\n<$B> \n\n Because   once they become professional uh they\nwould be required to   make a proposal  and that 's one way of\ngenerating money for their uhm for their boss\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-hmmmh  \n\n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause if ever they come out with a big proposal they might\nbe assured of a business that would yield profit to the company that they are\nworking for\n\n<$A> \n\nI uhm you have a point you have a point and I would like you\nto think about that you know because you have a point okay\n\n\nNow the the problem is you know I I would like to require them to\nmake a proposal but the problem you know is that, perhaps they have to\ndefend the title present the title and defend it otherwise I will not be sure\nwhether that particular proposal is, had been written by somebody else or\nthey just bought it somewhere\n\n\nSo perhaps the best way that we can do right now if you want them\nto make submit a proposal is that they have to present a certain title\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay now uh I scanned the syllabus and I found out that uh\nyou did not include <unclear> words </unclear>\n\n\nI found out that you did not include \" Report Writing\n\" as part of the uh syllabus\n\n<$A> \n\nIs that so\n\n\nThat 's the last part of the\n\n<$B> \n\nThere are there are some portions there, there 's a\nportion there wherein uh there is a need for you for them to uhm study about\nreport\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut then I found out that uh there was no specified report\nthat they are supposed to <unclear> words </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nLike for instance \" annual report \"  \n<unclear> word </unclear>  report\n\n<$A> \n\n Okay  \n\n\nYou know the reason for this is I was thinking of the time the\ntime frame that I think that for me  ha  for me what I 'm\ndoing is that after I have already finished discussing the steps the tendency\nis I usually let them make a scope but that is not a project it 's just an\nassignment\n\n\nIt 's the application of the five steps\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd you feel that uhm you 're not you 're not supposed to\ndwell on that particular topic\n\n<$A> \n\nI can\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause you feel it is not that important compared to other\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no no no\n\n\nI am not saying that it is not important but what I 'm telling you\nis it 's not supposed to be treated as a project\n\n\nIt is supposed to be a uh an assignment\n\n<$B> \n\nAn exercise\n\n<$A> \n\nAn exercise yes because if it is a project you know they are\ngood  e  they are very good in in buying copying something\nespecially now that we have the internet\n\n\nThey all they just get it from somebody else but I I require I\nrequire them to do a proposal I require them to present a progress report a\npreliminary report in the sense that it is just an exercise\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay one more thing\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm I 've noticed from my students that they are not that\nmotivated in studying \" Technical Writing \" maybe because\nthey felt that it is not uhm useful to them\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nNow in what way could I be able to motivate my students in\nsuch a way that uhm they are going to study and be interested in the subject\nmatter\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay so that 's the point\n\n\nNow let 's see\n\n\nIn the introductory part of the subject I always pinpoint the\nsignificance of \" Technical Writing \" in their chosen field\nof specialization\n\n\nAnd I always tell them that actually \" Technical Writing\n\" is a boring subject\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy because you need to well let 's say they 're not gonna\nmemorize it but they have to understand everything by heart\n\n\nIsn't it because we 're talking about the principles\n\n\nNow but to motivate them, okay to like the subject so that,\nI have to I always emphasize to them the importance of this because they\ncannot perform their work in the future without knowing how to prepare\ntechnical reports because this is half of their their lives when they become\nprofessionals\n\n\nThis will be half of the profession that they

when they will be in a  year \n\n\nAnd I always emphasize to them that they cannot graduate unless\nthey have to write a thesis\n\n\nAnd for them to come up with an effective and complete thesis they\nneed to study \" Technical Writing \"\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd that 's good  ano  you\n\n<$A> \n\n  Yes \n\n<$B> \n\n You   you require them the uh proposal in\naccordance with <unclear> words </unclear>

\n\nSo naturally uh since some of the problem that they are\nencountering uh deals with grammars\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nWe at times go back to the basic  ,  which\nsometimes eat most of our time\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes  \n\n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nNow what do you do with those students who dos not even know\nhow to write simple English or sentence\n\n<$A> \n\nWell well that 's a problem but you know sometimes if that 's\nthe case uh I have to I have experienced tutoring students\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's a good <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's very very hard but you know I cannot blame the teachers\nin in their previous English subjects because you know he cannot cater to all\nright to all sixty students right\n\n\nSo there will always be this problem but you know sometimes we\nhave to spend extra hour and extra patience you know not only teaching their\nsubject but also going back to this particular uh grammar thing because they\ncannot write without knowing their <unclear> word </unclear> so that 's the\nonly thing I can offer them\n\n\nIt 's just to tutor them with <unclear> word </unclear> past\nsubjects especially in grammar", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source":

schools\n\n<$A> \n\nWow\n\n<$B> \n\nSo if you 're a supervisor not a subject supervisor you 're an\nadministrative supervisor you don't you don't only oversee like the the\nspecific subject that you 're in charge but you 're administering <unclear>\nwords </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nSo he 's he 's an administrative supervisor\n\n<$B> \n\nYes he 's actually Supervisor Two because there 's also a\nSupervisor One\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat 's that\n\n<$B> \n\nUh a little bit lower in designation but it 's \n\n<$A> \n\nDoes it pay well\n\n<$B> \n\nUh now I think it pays well it pays well\n\n\nBut before of course with the the salary scheme in the public in\nthe public education in the Philippines it 's really it 's really I don't\nthink it pays well\n\n\nBut as of this time I think the pay is good\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd that is the father of your   father \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   the father of my father\n\n\nYeah my father is an engineer but my the family of where my father\ncame from are actually teachers\n\n\nThe sister the youngest sister of my grandfather is a retired\nmaster teacher\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat 's a master teacher\n\n<$B> \n\nUh a master teacher is, actually in relation to salary he\n's he or she is equivalent to a principal but uh he or she decided not to\nhold administrative position but rather stay in the classroom and teach\n\n\nOk so uh in salary they 're almost the same uh as the principal but\ndoesn't have administrative role\n\n<$A> \n\nMaster teacher\n\n<$B> \n\nMaster teacher yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nBut is that category still being used today\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah, yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what what will qualify someone to become uh a master\nteacher\n\n<$B> \n\nA master teacher actually achieves that position after a long\ntime\n\n\nYou really could not become a master teacher without without really\nuh having that experience in the classroom for a long time because that means\nyou have to earn the respect of the other teachers\n\n\nThen you have to respect also the the you earn the respect also of\nthe the parents of the children that you that you have taught\n\n\nSo you it only it only means that you have been in teaching and you\nhave mastered you have mastered teaching\n\n\nThat you are an effective teacher for a long time\n\n\nSo there there are  it 's actually one of the rankings\nthat uh every teacher in the public school in in Visaya you know\n\n\nSo they can after a long time of teaching maybe they can they can\napply for it\n\n<$A> \n\nMaster teacher\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah because in the public school there are rankings like you\n're you 're an elementary teaching you 're Elementary Teacher One Elementary\nTeacher Two\n\n<$A> \n\n  So \n\n<$B> \n\n Elementary   Teacher Three\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen our graduates passed the the board exam   they \n\n<$B> \n\n They   <unclear> words </unclear> to the public\nschools\n\n<$A> \n\nThe first the base category is\n\n<$B> \n\nYes sir it 's basically just an elementary teacher or  \nschool  teacher\n\n<$A> \n\n One  \n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe \" One \"\n\n\nIt depends\n\n<$A> \n\n  Elementary Teacher One \n\n<$B> \n\n It depends on where   they 're assigned also\nbecause you 're like you are a uh uh grade one teacher or grade two teacher\nor grade three teacher but there are still ranking there are still rankings\nuh on those levels because you have to also I think you also have to earn\nthose rankings because the what do you call this the the division office or\nthe supervisor 's office\n\n\nOh I don't know if they have they have to undergo testing but I\nthink they have testing and it will also depend on the different evaluations\nthat the division office or the district office will receive and they will\nrank the teachers\n\n\nAnd your salary also depends on those rankings\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what is the lowest uhm Teacher One\n\n<$B> \n\nI think Teacher One\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then Teacher Two\n\n<$B> \n\nTeacher Two depending on the grade level\n\n\nThere are also grade levels  e \n\n\nSo if you 're uh you 're uh an upper grade level teacher one way or\nthe other and you have a you have a higher ranking you will also receive \n a higher  salary\n\n<$A> \n\n So   uh one who teaches high school gets a higher\nsalary compared to one who teaches grade one\n\n<$B> \n\nNo   no  there are rankings in different uh year\nlevels\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh  \n\n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you also will be ranked\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nSo if you 're ranked the lowest you 'll get you 'll get the lowest\nsalary\n\n<$A> \n\n Talaga \n\n<$B> \n\nI think the problem the problem right now uh with public\nschools is that sometimes even in getting a higher rank or getting a\npromotion for that matter is usually dependent on whom you know in the office\nand sometimes even with evaluation that 's why other people get higher\nrankings is because the evaluation are also at times manipulated\n\n<$A> \n\nBy the students\n\n<$B> \n\nNo by the by the principal by the by the other people\nadministering the rank\n\n<$A> \n\nSo let 's go through the ranking\n\n\nTeacher One Teacher   Two Teacher Three \n\n<$B> \n\n Teacher Two   Teacher Three yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nTeacher Four\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd different\n\n<$A> \n\nIs it is it only until Teacher Three\n\n<$B> \n\nUh I don't know right now because it has changed  e\npero , in the past  kasi  like if you are a grade\none teacher uh if\n\n\nFor example there are like uh one hundred teachers in a division\nor in a district for example okay you might be an Elementary Teacher One\nelementary uh grade one grade one teacher\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYou 're a Grade Six Teacher but based on the rankings and in\nuh together with all the other teachers in the district you 're ranked like\nif you are one hundred and you 're ranked one hundred that means you have the\nlowest  ranking so that means your salary will be given uh you\nwill be given I mean the lowest salary based on the scale because they have\nseveral scales  e \n\n<$A> \n\nSeveral   scales \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   so you will be ranked uh with all the\nother teachers in the in the district and then in your school you will also\nbe ranked uh\n\n<$A> \n\nReally\n\n<$B> \n\nWith all the other teachers in the school\n\n<$A> \n\nIs that true\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nEven right now\n\n<$B> \n\nEven right now\n\n<$A> \n\nSo if there are twenty teachers\n\n<$B> \n\nYou will you will be ranked where are you in\n\n<$A> \n\nMy gosh\n\n\nEven in private schools\n\n<$B> \n\nNo, private schools they don't have that\n\n<$A> \n\nOnly public schools\n\n<$B> \n\nOnly public schools\n\n\nI think it is because of the issue of salary and promotions\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause if you go uh if you go higher in the ranking system\nin the end you you will realize that you 're already like you can already be\npromoted to principal or assistant principal or maybe if you don't want to be\na principal you can   <unclear> words </unclear>  in retiring as a\nmaster teacher\n\n<$A> \n\n A master teacher  \n\n\nTsk tsk tsk\n\n<$B> \n\nThe the youngest sister of my grandfather is a master teacher\n\n\nMy the eldest sister of my father she 's already a school\nprincipal\n\n\nShe 's also uh I think a master teacher also\n\n<$A> \n\nWow\n\n<$B> \n\nMy auntie one of my auntie right now\n\n<$A> \n\nThe sister of your brother\n\n<$B> \n\nMy the younger sister the sister next to my father is a is I\nthink she 's a grade six teacher\n\n<$A> \n\nShe 's also a master teacher\n\n<$B> \n\nUh not yet\n\n\nUh the brother uh the brother of my father the one before him\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nWas when she 's also he 's also dead now\n\n<$A> \n\nHuh\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah he 's already\n\n<$A> \n\nOlder than your  father\n\n<$B> \n\nOlder than my father\n\n\nUh the brother the brother before my father\n\n\nUh he was I think elementary grade  \nuh grade six elementary teacher\n\n\nSo we 're they 're basically they 're all teachers\n\n\nSo my desire for books maybe I have I got that from from from the\n  <unclear> words </unclear>  my father 's family\n\n<$A> \n\n The teaching clan   no\n\n\nI notice several people from Bicol\n\n\nIt 's either they are teachers or priests\n\n<$B> \n\nOr military men\n\n<$A> \n\nMilitary\n\n\n Talaga \n\n<$B> \n\nWell, one brother of my father is a is a Constabulary trainor\nin Camp Crame before\n\n\nNow another brother was a major in the army and like several\ncousins of my father are are actually in the police force\n\n\nSo it 's either military or religious leaders priests nuns or\nteachers\n\n\nAnd I think in Bicol that 's common because basically Bicol is a\nreligious is a religious region\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yeah\n\n\nWhy is it religious\n\n<$B> \n\nOh maybe because of the strong influence of Catholicism in\nthe province\n\n\nMy grandfather for example is a\n\n<$A> \n\nPriest\n\n<$B> \n\nUh no\n\n\nHe is uh he 's called an he 's he 's a board member of the parish\n\n\nAnd during Holy Week he would usually act as one of the disciples\n\n\nRemember during Holy Week they you would see like men uh like uh\nasking for donations\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nThey 're in like in costumes like they 're apostles the\ndisciples during the time of Jesus\n\n\nSo they would usually do that as the part of the work of the\nparish\n\n\nThey would usually act as disciples or apostles during the Holy\nWeek and ask for donations\n\n\nThey walk from uh they walk from the parish to the different\n barangays \n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nNo they 're in sandals\n\n<$A> \n\nBut dressed in\n\n<$B> \n\nDressed in like the apostles like they put long clothes and\n\n<$A> \n\nWho are the people who usually do that\n\n<$B> \n\nThey are the parish board\n\n\nMost of them are members of the board of the parish\n\n<$A> \n\nAre they respectable men and women   respectable \n\n<$B> \n\n They 're usually   considered also as respectable\nreligious leaders\n\n<$A> \n\nLike the elders of the land  ,  similar to that\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah  \n\n\nThey 're not they 're not uh priests they 're uh laymen\n\n\nBut they also act as lay ministers \n\n\nSo they can also like they can also like give communions they can\nalso give uh they can also officiate Mass they can also uh\n\n<$A> \n\nIs there a priest in the family\n\n<$B> \n\nWith us in among the distant relatives there are priests in\nfact parish priests and I don't know if we have a bishop already among the\nthe uh\n\n<$A> \n\nThe \" Pura \"\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nThe surname \" Pura \" uh it did did the did\nyour relatives originally uh did they originate uh from Bicol\n\n\n\" Pura \"\n\n<$B> \n\nActually\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Pura clan\n\n<$B> \n\nOur clan came from uh they said it originally came from\nIloilo uh but later on migrated to the Bicol region, migrated to the Bicol\nregion\n\n\nThey 're businessmen and later on became teachers and other\nleaders but I don't know\n\n\nUh because most of us came from there most of most of those that I\nknow with that family name came from that province\n\n<$A> \n\nFrom Iloilo\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom Iloilo\n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n\nSo the \" Pura \"  ha \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but I think the desire for books is can be traced can be\ntraced uh can be traced to my father 's family\n\n\nUh my grandfather has maintained   his own library \n\n<$A> \n\n What is your   what is your  ay \nreally\n\n\nThe father of your father\n\n<$B> \n\nThe father of my father has maintained his own\n\n<$A> \n\nHow many volumes does he

of you talk in English you mean that 's the common language that you use\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's the common language to use in in the class but uh if you 're talking with fellow uh Filipinos then you can you can converse in Tagalog\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I see\n\n<$B> \n\nBut if you 're talking to a foreigner but some of them you know uh the foreigners can also understand uh Filipino so uhm they they would like to learn also our language so yeah they you can talk to them in English then with uh some Filipino words to help them also to learn\n\n<$A> \n\nWell how about how about the age I mean   are they all the same age as you  \n\n\n  You 're still quite young  \n\n<$B> \n\n The age   \n\n\n Oh you mean you   \n\n\nYeah you know uhm uhm some of them maybe I can say that they are around forties the thirties the\n\n\nFrom thirties forties to fifties uh only a few are uh in the line of twenties    oo   I\n\n<$A> \n\n Oh I see   \n\n\nSo some can pass as your grandfather <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah you know the first time I was in the class uh the the first day of my class in A T S uh they thought I was the youngest in the class\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah looks can be deceiving\n\n<$B> \n\nLooks can be deceiving  and my height too\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah you can pass as a  'no  just cute\n\n<$B> \n\nAs a what as a grade schooler\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah a grade schooler\n\n\nIt 's a compliment by the way  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah that 's a compliment okay thank you  \n\n\n O  so you are planning to enroll this sem this coming sem\n\n<$A> \n\nYes well actually I have here a brochure or a catalogue of another school\n\n<$B> \n\nOf another school\n\n<$A> \n\nYes it 's quite near our office it 's around it is also in Makati\n\n\nUhm I 'm kind of thinking which school would be best suited for me\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course our school is the best  \n\n<$A> \n\nWell of course  whatever you say\n\n<$B> \n\nBut you know what uh what kind of uh degree program would you like to be into \n\n in Mission or M Div in Pastoral Studies something like Biblical Studies\n\n<$A> \n\nWell uhm well I really like to work in a school   as a counselor  or even as a teacher even a seminary teacher you know I enjoy I enjoy teaching \n\n<$B> \n\n A school   \n\n\nTeaching maybe you can get the same uhm degree program as I am uh as I am into\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay which is\n\n<$B> \n\nUh that 's M A in Christian Education but you can get the the M Div in Christian Education which is uh a higher you know a higher program because you you learn uh Greek the Hebrew\n\n<$A> \n\nOh you learn the Greek language you mean they teach Greek\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah they teach Greek and Hebrew in M Div courses but in M A courses they don't teach\n\n\nWe don't have to uh we don't require to get that uh subject\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I see okay\n\n<$B> \n\nUh yeah but uh you know M Div is much uh uh it 's much difficult but uh it 's more challenging if you are in that uh course\n\n<$A> \n\nSo those courses uhm mold you into a pastor or\n\n<$B> \n\nUh more likely yeah more likely into a uh pastor or a church church leader type yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nChurch leader  ,  sounds interesting\n\n\nWell what other courses do your school offer\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n \n\n\nHold it  ha  \n\n<$A> \n\nSure \n\n<$B> \n\n Chris Chris\n\n\nSo uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYes where were we\n\n<$B> \n\nWhere were we  \n\n<$A> \n\nYou were talking about\n\n<$B> \n\nWe were talking about the uh M Div in Counseling right\n\n\nI 'm telling you about another degree program called counseling\n\n<$A> \n\nOh hey that sounds very interesting\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah you can enroll in that uh field if you want to if you have if you feel you have the gift of being a counselor\n\n<$A> \n\nOh you know I always imagine myself talking to uh high schoolers teenagers about matters of you know the heart or whatever their schooling\n\n\nI really enjoy their company you know that might be a very good field for me\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah maybe you can you can uh enroll in that course\n\n<$A> \n\nThe thing that uh your school and this school that I have a brochure with offers the same courses\n\n<$B> \n\nDoes it offer uh counseling program also in that school you uh the one that you 'are saying\n\n<$A> \n\nCounseling program yes I think so\n\n<$B> \n\nThey have\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah it says here that they have actually they already have a schedule a schedule for the year\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah uh-huh\n\n Uh uh is it uh the schedule is uh uh only in A M\n\n\nI mean in morning and afternoon\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I 'm planning to go to that school tomorrow tomorrow morning\n\n<$B> \n\nTo inquire about\n\n<$A> \n\nTo inquire more about it\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's quite interesting\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause in our school we also have evening classes in some subjects particularly the the Old Testament survey or New Testament survey\n\n<$A> \n\nBut it 's very quite far from where I am\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah it 's quite far from your place of work in Makati right  'no  but uh uh the joy of seeing me there  the joy of seeing me there and uh with uh some of my classmates you know we can make you happy\n\n<$A> \n\nThat definitely makes me feel  wholesome   \n\n<$B> \n\nWhat it makes you feel what\n\n<$A> \n\n Wholesome  \n\n<$B> \n\nHandsome\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n\nWell yeah that too  \n\n<$B> \n\nAhhh so uh it 's nice that you are planning to enroll  'no  \n\n\nHopefully that in five years time you 'll be a pastor\n\n<$A> \n\nFive years  ,  oh that long\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n That 's long\n\n<$A> \n\nI can't wait for that long\n\n<$B> \n\nYou can't wait  ha  so if you are going to study you should uh resign from your job\n\n<$A> \n\nI can't I 'm sorry but I can't\n\n<$B> \n\nYou can't also so how is that\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I 'm planning to uh take my classes during lunch break  \n\n<$B> \n\nOh that 's not possible  ,   because uh one or a subject is uh most of the subjects are three-unit courses uh uh three-unit subjects I mean and uh you need three hours  ,  per subject\n\n<$A>", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f9432866-a5ed-4c2e-96a9-910197dcfe68", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.041184+00:00"}

that\n\n<$B> \n\nAbout what\n\n<$A> \n\nUh remember when we had the project on International Corpus of\nEnglish\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nUh well part of the uh data that she needs for the project is\nthe direct  distance conversation which is a telephone\nconversation\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nSo do you mind if I record our conversation\n\n\nDid she\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no she told me that\n\n<$A> \n\nUh all right\n\n<$B> \n\nUh I told her I 'll be happy to talk with Loy  ,  \nI was expecting your call but you must have been very busy\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh okay   \n\n\nYeah because I 'm data gathering Sir\n\n\nI 'm trying to be uh well I I 'm in one school at seven to ten\nthirty in the morning and I have one hour or so to get to another school by\ntwelve o clock\n\n<$B> \n\nWell by the way what 's what 's the thrust of your of your\nresearch\n\n<$A> \n\nWell it 's uh Psycholinguistics and Sociolinguistics in nature\n\n\nUh it 's a look at uh Filipino-English bilingual children 's\nlanguage acquisition  ,  and it 's trying to explore whether\nthere is a relationship among their degree of bilingualism uh in relation to\nhow their parents talk to them and metalinguistic ability their ability to\ncontrol and analyze language\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh   \n\n\nWell that 's very interesting\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n\nSo I am not into Language Planning  \n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> I hope you 're recording this now\n\n<$A> \n\nYes Sir I am  ,  I just turned on the recorder\n\n\nSo yeah\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nSo uh when do you expect to uh complete uh gathering that\n\n<$A> \n\nSir uh I 'm almost half way through\n\n\nUh the data gathering requires that I individually test twenty-five\nto thirty children from three different schools\n\n\nUhm all of the schools based on tuition fee that are asked for them\nto pay are categorized in the middle class section\n\n\nSo\n\n<$B> \n\nWell there are supposed to be three levels\n\n\nWell I think in the <unclear> words </unclear> I think there were\nthe  ilustrados  the rich and then the poor that 's it\n\n ,  \n\n\nSo the the middle class appeared actually uh the middle class\nappeared in the Philippines and uh  ,  but what I am\ninterested in is uh how the middle class\n\n<$A> \n\n Right   \n\n\n Uhm   \n\n\nI remembered you in one of your talks I remember vividly how you\nmentioned that uh one of the driving force of the creation of the middle\nclass is the requirement for uh putting in place English as a medium of\ninstruction in school\n\n\nDo I remember what you said correctly\n\n<$B> \n\nYou see <unclear> words </unclear> in the middle class\nespecially the uh upper middle class  ,  you can divide the\nupper class again into three uh upper middle lower something like that  \n\n,  \n\n\nAnd of course it depends upon your criteria that <unclear> words\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> something like that I consider\nmyself belonging to the middle class  ,  not upper but you\nsee uh in other respects I belong to the upper class  ,  uh I\nlecture around the  ,  world and so forth like that\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\n Yeah   \n\n\n Yeah   \n\n\nUh-uhm so it depends on the criteria\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> so for example the middle class in\nthe United States would be different from the middle class in the Philippines\n\n\n<unclear> words </unclear> I think should be <unclear> words\n\n</unclear> of the country like <unclear> words </unclear> a special case\ntheir middle class is I think different from our middle class  , \n\n something like that\n\n\nUh so it is a very interesting study uh\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah yeah   \n\n\nUhm I 've done I I think I need two more sessions and then I 'm\nalready finished with the last test in the two schools after which uh I I\nneed to spend another three weeks or so in De La Salle Zobel in Alabang and\nthen after that uh perhaps just another couple of weeks to go back to the\nparents uh who may not have submitted their  conversation\ndata yet at that time uh and more or less the data should be complete\n\n\nSo I 'm thinking I 'm I 'm thinking about March the latest should\nbe end of March for the data gathering Sir\n\n\nWhat I 'm trying to do at the same time when I 'm not able to\ngather data is try to already you know uh manage it in a certain way so that\nuh by the time I 'm finished with all the three schools uh simultaneously I 'm\nalso uh able to do something with the data and not\n\n<$B> \n\nWell are you do you have any pre-determined uh grid of\n\n<unclear> words </unclear> or classifications of <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-uhm uh yeah the the some of the factors some of the\nvariables that can be in the grid are are uh the results of the tests I have\nuh validated I I tested them with the validated comprehension uh test which\nuh Dr De Ocampo from U P Diliman made\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's a validated what\n\n<$A> \n\nUh it 's a comprehension test\n\n<$B> \n\nWritten\n\n<$A> \n\nUh well uh in her case it was uh the the the kids had to write\ntheir their answer but for me since my respondents are pre-school students so\nI individually administered the test and then I took uh I I was the one who\nwho wrote the answers on the paper\n\n<$B> \n\nIs that right\n\n\nThey are not recorded\n\n<$A> \n\nPardon Sir\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah they are not recorded on tape\n\n<$A> \n\nThe responses\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nUh in some cases yes in others no\n\n\nSo for instance uhm for all the students what I do with them is\nfirst I have a very short interview which aims at familiarizing them with me\nand at the same time uh trying to gather some salient information such as who\nspends most of the time or who spends time with you at home things like that\nand what language they use when talking to you and who reads to you at night\nsomething like that\n\n\nAnd then the second part when I 'm done with that very short\ninterview uh it 's a comprehension test in both English and Filipino\n\n<$B> \n\nComprehensive what\n\n<$A> \n\nComprehension test\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh comprehension test\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh and it also it tests for their level of bilingualism in\nterms of whether they 're able to understand both English and Filipino\nequally well or they 're dominant in one of the two languages\n\n<$B> \n\nYes you see this is it uh this hasn't been studied\n\n\nMy suspicion is that in the Philippines  ,  \nespecially in the public schools  ,  uh you you know the\npublic schools and the private schools well of course there 's uh <unclear> \nwords </unclear> \n\n\nIndeed there are some private schools that somehow they 're not the\nkind of <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\nPrivate schools right\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nYou said that you are going to you are recording them\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I 'm recording\n\n\nAfter the comprehension test the next test which I give them is\ncalled the it 's called an Arbitrariness Test\n\n\nWhat it is Sir is like uh it tests for their control of the\nlanguage right so\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah you use \" control of the language \" uh\nyou know there 's the term \" semilingual \" uh\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat I see now in the Philippines <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm tired of that <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nThe way I I look at it where I come from uh <unclear> words\n\n</unclear> people around here like that\n\n\nA semilingual is a person who neither has control of the subject\nmatter  ,  nor the language\n\n<$A> \n\n Facility   uh-uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> many teachers now\n\n\nThis is why I would like to I I would be happy to <unclear> words\n\n</unclear> wherein we would uh study uh the semilingualism that is being uh\n\n developed\n\n\nHaving a semilingual class in the Philippines who do not know who\ncan have no control of the subject matter they have no control of the uh many\nof them don't know first they don't know the language according to and then\nit 's it 's not that only that they do not know the English language uh you\nknow the <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nAnd therefore the worst thing is because they do not know the\nlanguage they have no control of the language\n\n\nNot only that they they do not know the the content\n\n\nIn other words when you are speaking uh when you speak you have\nsome control of both language and content\n\n\nNow uh if you don't uh if you have no control of both that is you\nare weak in both  ,  then you are a semilingual  , \n\n \n\n\nAnd uh there are so many semilinguals in the Philippines now  \n\n,  and many of them teachers\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\n Yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's very unfortunate  ,  \n\n\nSome teachers come to my house  ,  and then they\nare very afraid especially my relatives because I speak to them in English\nand they would shift you know and I say no I want when we talk in English\neverything must be in English I don't want a mixture  ,  and\nso they are very nervous\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\n \n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's why they avoid my  ,  they avoid me\nthey don't come to my house uh these are relatives the relatives of my wife\nand my relatives\n\n\nOf course I 'm harsh on them but uh\n\n\nYou know in the schools this is just guesswork now this is I have\nno data but uh based on certain uh well <unclear> words </unclear> teachers\nto professionals they give examinations to professionals boards something\nlike that for teachers  ,  \n\n\nNow I have a booklet here and I don't know where I got it but\nanyway I think a friend of mine or something\n\n\nUh anyway uh many of them do not know have no control of both\nlanguages\n\n\nI say \" languages \" because they have no control\nof the of say Filipino and they have no control of English\n\n\nThen they do not have control of the subject matter\n\n\nThey don't <unclear> words </unclear> so  <unclear> \nwords </unclear> \n\n\nAnd then many of these people become teachers so it 's good you\nknow uh of course the lawyer the lawyer 's mistake goes behind bars uh the\ndoctor 's mistake gets buried underground\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n Right   \n\n\n And the teacher 's mistake gets multiplied\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd the teacher 's mistake goes on spreading the rot\n\n<$A> \n\n \n\n<$B> \n\nSo I mean this is tragic  ,  \n\n\nAnd the worst thing is uh <unclear> words </unclear> or a lawyer\nor a doctor\n\n\nI am conceited to think that I have the brains for any of the\nthree\n\n\nUh and but my father said look it is also economic now you are the\neldest you are the oldest among six children\n\n\nWe are very poor\n\n\nMy father was Municipal Treasurer long ago and uh he said uh I\nwant you as the oldest to help that is your duty\n\n\nSo I want you to take up Normal to take up teaching uh and you can\neasily   be a teacher  if you graduate\n\n\nWell the interviews were done mostly by Americans\n\n\nAnd so uh because of poverty and not of my choice I became a\nteacher I became a teacher\n\n\nUh well of course I was in the news the other day whether this is\ngood or not because well the you know uh James Joyce 's \" Ulysses\n\n\" the stream of consciousness the novel that started the genre of\nstream of consciousness continued by Thomas Wolfe in \" Look Homeward\nAngel \" and uh uh \" You Can't Go \"  have you read those novels\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n Work   uh-uhm\n\n\nUh I think the first one I did, I did that when I was doing my\nliterature in Australia\n\n<$B> \n\n\" Look Homeward Angel \" \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nWell then well you see I have two Masters degrees one is in\nPsychology and the other is in English Literature\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nSo there was once upon a time I thought I 'd be a great\nwriter but uh I got over that something like that\n\n\nNow if you are recording this conversation it would be very\ninteresting to be played back\n\n<$A> \n\n I can bring it tomorrow I 'll be there\ntomorrow for your uh the Dr Vilches' Professorial lecture\n\n\nYou 're gonna be in La Salle tomorrow right\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'll be there\n\n<$B> \n\nGood\n\n\nI will as usual I will deliver the uh sometimes they are long\n\n\nI tend to talk and talk and talk and talk and there is no\n\n<unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nWe don't mind\n\n\nFor one the affair is done in honor of you so you can talk as much\nas you like and I think people are fascinated when you talk because you are\nvery funny\n\n<$B> \n\n I don't know\n\n\nWell but you see I cannot make it too long because the food is\nwaiting and some some of the people who are listening look back at the table\nwhere the food is\n\n\nWell anyway so I 'll see you tomorrow\n\n<$A> \n\nYes Sir I 'll be there\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nBut you know you mentioned about being interested in finding\nout whether how semilingual especially teachers are\n\n\nYou know you 'd be interested if I 'm able to manage the data uh\nlater you 'd be interested to find out that what the results would be because\napparently uh what I 'm doing in the study is to see how one of the parents\nof the child talk to the child and and the child how the child talks back to\nthe parent\n\n\nSo I 'm recording that uh and I 'm doing that to find out whether\nthe parent would be talking mostly in English or in Filipino or\ncode-switching in those languages\n\n<$B> \n\nAre these structured or are they uh what 's the opposite of\n\n\" structured \" \n\n\nAre the interviews that you are recording structured\n\n<$A> \n\nUh well it 's not it 's not arbitrarily done\n\n\nWhat happens is that I have created uh an album of pictures that\ndon't have any text\n\n<$B> \n\nUh so there is a structure\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah it 's it 's structured and controlled in that sense but\nat the same time uh  ,  what I 've done is well for one the\npictures have to meet certain criteria such as they they they shouldn't be\nculture-bound the items they would see in the picture yeah yeah and that the\npictures are easily accessible in both English and Filipino\n\n\nSo I I was able to come up with those pictures\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nAre they photographs or drawings\n\n<$A> \n\nUh no\n\n\nUh you know I ended up I ended up borrowing my daughter 's bedtime\nstorybooks and I was able to find there items that are easily accessible in\nEnglish and Filipino and then I just scanned and printed them out  , \n\n and yeah then when I spoke with the parents I either met with them I 'm\nmeeting some of them uh or I call them over the phone\n\n\nI just explain to them that I 'm just interested in the way they\ntalk to their children\n\n\nSo no specific uh bidding in terms of saying whether it 's English\nor Filipino uhm so it 's yeah\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nUh I see", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7ea5b267-3796-4625-b135-547ef6378fd5", "added":

become very emotional\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause you know uhm being far from your father is really\nreally difficult especially for me\n\n\nI 'm an Accounting student   and \n\n<$B> \n\n Yes  \n\n<$A> \n\nYou know if I 'm dealing with very hard problems regarding my\nuh my course I could not ask anyone because he 's the only Accounting in the\nfamily uh and also my  lola  but then she 's not here with us\n\n<$B> \n\n  Oh \n\n<$A> \n\n So   it 's very very difficult for me   and\n\n\n<$B> \n\n So   your father is an accountant   working\n abroad\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes  \n\n\nYes Sir\n\n<$B> \n\nWhere is he working\n\n\n    what uh uh and how long has he been\n  working  abroad\n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm  \n\n\n Uhm  \n\n\nHe 's been working at I M F and World Bank for   two   two years now\n\n<$B>

also aiming for that kind of uhm, uhm profession that he\nthat he 's having   right now \n\n<$B> \n\n Okay  \n\n\nBut but you are in Accountancy\n\n<$A> \n\nYes of course but but then you know the the the what do you\ncall   this \n\n<$B> \n\n The   demands of the\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nThe difficulties of uh being an Accounting Accounting  \nstudent  are pretty how shall we put it \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah yeah  \n\n<$B> \n\nUh demanding very demanding\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes very demanding because you know all companies need  accountants right\n\n\nThey cannot run the business without accountants because who would\ntake care of their resources but the accountants\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd it is where with the with the uhm papers that accountants\nare are making it is where they get their uhm uh what do you call this\n ano nga \u0091yun  \n\n\nOh my God\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy\n\n<$A> \n\nOh my God\n\n\nI 'm I 'm so nervous\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy are you nervous\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause I 'm with Attorney Bautista\n\n\nI 'm going to talk to him   about anything \n\n<$B> \n\n But you 've   never been my student\n\n\nWe 've   never been  I 've never had the privilege of\nteaching you\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yes Sir\n\n<$B> \n\nSo don 't feel nervous\n\n<$A> \n\n I 'm really sorry\n\n\nI mean oh my God I mean I don 't know what to say oh my God\n\n<$B> \n\n Let 's talk about your uh your family\n\n\nHow many brothers and sisters do you have\n\n<$A> \n\nOh we are only two\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nYes I only have one sister\n\n\nWe 're both girls\n\n\n  Yes \n\n<$B> \n\n I see  \n\n\nAnd you are the elder or the \n\n<$A> \n\nI 'm the eldest\n\n<$B> \n\nYou 're the elder   daughter  of your uh, of Mr\n Valenzuela  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yes  \n\n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh and what does your mom do\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm my mom <unclear> words </unclear> she 's a housewife but\nuhm she can sometimes she can can uhm what do you call this teach  ay\n she does some tutorial jobs something like that yes to high school\nstudents because\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nShe  ano  when she  she was in\ncollege she was taking liberal arts\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nBut then unluckily she she she did not uhm make it to the uh\nwhat do you call this to the last year of her studies because she got married\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n\nBut then then it 's okay with her because well being a plain\nhousewife and being a very good mom is you know\n\n<$B> \n\nWell don 't I don 't think we should uh, uh use the\nadjective \" plain \"   when  it comes to\n\" housewife \"   because  it sounds a bit\nderogatory   you know \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh okay   so\n\n\n Uh okay  \n\n\n Yeah yeah  \n\n<$B> \n\nIt doesn 't sound right but well of course that 's what we hear\n \u0091no \n\n\nWe always have that impression when uh when a a mother does not\nwork she is just a plain housewife\n\n<$A> \n\nYes oh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut in reality  ,  uh they  these\nthese individuals are these are the silent and the  bonafide\n   heroes  of of our uh of our community\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh  \n\n\n Uh-hmmmh  \n\n<$B> \n\nHad it not been for your mom  di ba   \n<,>  there would be a a I mean you would not be where you are today and\nuh you really owe her a lot in the sense that uh her, she has given you\nthe her gift of presence\n\n\nThat 's one thing that working moms and working dads cannot give\ntheir children\n\n\nAnd their children as you have just pointed out   you 're\n already you 're already a young lady and yet you miss your father\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh  \n\n\n Yes  \n\n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nYou 're already I believe of voting age, are you not\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm   uh \n\n<$B> \n\n Not   yet\n\n<$A> \n\nNot yet but actually I 'll be turning eighteen in July \nna \n\n<$B> \n\nOh so, you 're going to celebrate your debut\n\n\nAnyway as I was saying uh well children need the presence of at\nleast one parent  while\n\n<$A> \n\nYes that 's true\n\n<$B> \n\nBut of course uh the reality is that uh our uh demands our uh\nour milieu our environment is is such a way that uh we no longer have the\npresence of in some cases  \u0091no  both parents because both are\neither working abroad  ,  or they send their children to the  uh to to Manila and they are province-based\n\n\nTherefore they don 't see their children because of these certain\nuh, uh realities whether they are economic realities or social uh, uh\nrealities\n\n\nSome things we just have to accept\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-hmmmh  \n\n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I guess in your case you can still be thankful because\n\n<$A> \n\nOf course\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause your mom is around and your father while he is\nworking abroad\n\n\nBy the way   uh  is he is he working in the States\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes  \n\n\nYes he is\n\n<$B> \n\nUh so he is working in the World Bank\n\n\nIs that in New York or is it in uh is it in uh   Washington\n D C\n\n<$A> \n\n Washington   D C\n\n<$B> \n\n Ayan  Washington D C\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo when is he scheduled to come back and pay you a visit\n\n<$A> \n\nActually he doesn 't have any plans of coming back here in the\nPhilippines because he he he wants to uh bring millions of dollars first \n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A> \n\nHere and uh he wants me to finish first my studies\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n\nHe he has his personal uhm uh he he has his personal what do you\ncall it\n\n\n Nawala na \u0091ko \n\n<$B> \n\n He has his personal \n\n<$A> \n\nUhm plans for yes for the future\n\n\nSo I don 't know\n\n\nI 'm always asking him   but \n\n<$B> \n\n So   he 's not coming back to you let 's say\nChristmas visit\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no he 's not\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nYes that 's very actually that 's very sad but then it 's okay\n\n<$B> \n\nAre you sure about this\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nHow do you know that he has no plans of paying you a visit\nthis Christmas\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm we were always talking about it  e  and\nactually every time he 's telling me that thing I 'm always crying because I\nreally really miss him a lot\n\n<$B> \n\nUh you are a mama 's  uh a  uh a papa 's\ngirl\n\n<$A> \n\nActually no\n\n\n  When he \n\n<$B> \n\n Oh  \n\n<$A> \n\nHere 's the story\n\n\nWhen he was still here in the Philippines I used to hate him \n because  of some things that I don 't understand\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh-huh  \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A> \n\nBut then when he 's gone,   uhm \n\n<$B> \n\n When   he 's out\n\n<$A> \n\nYes when he went there   I  understand all of those\nthings why why he 's doing that thing\n\n<$B> \n\n Okay  \n\n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nOr it 's just because of for us it 's because of us it 's all\nfor us\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay okay\n\n\nWait\n\n\nWhat is your nickname\n\n<$A> \n\n Pat \n\n<$B> \n\n Pat \n\n<$A> \n\nYou can call me  Pat  or  Patis \n\n\nMy parents used to call me  Patis  \n\n<$B> \n\nOkay  Pat \n\n\nTake a deep breath \n\n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nNow you are more relaxed\n\n\nAre you relaxed\n\n<$A> \n\n Okay\n\n<$B> \n\nYou have to take uh a deep breath when you are uh nervous or\nagitated or when you 're made to speak before an audience of two thousand\nthree thousand people\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know you have to take a deep breath\n\n\nThat   is one  thing that we should remember  when we especially when we speak in front of an audience\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-hmmmh  \n\n\nYes thank you   so much \n\n<$B> \n\n Remember   that while while you cannot see me\nvisually\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh and that 's why I see no reason why you have to be nervous\n or or anxious\n\n\nUh these these uh tips that I give you when you speak before an\naudience you have to produce this uh aura of control of of confidence of\nstrength and we can only do this if you know if we are uh how can we put it\n \u0091no  if we are in a state of relaxation\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's it actually it 's a how would you it 's a you draw a fine\nline between a relaxed uh mode and a tense mode\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut you got to be more on the relaxed mode\n\n\nThat way you can produce that aura uh\n\n\nSo that 's one thing that you need to remember when you when Mr\nFlores is going to ask you to speak in front of an audience or conduct an\ninterview,\n\n\nExhale inhale exhale\n\n<$A> \n\nExhale\n\n<$B> \n\nNow let 's go back to the topic\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nYou said you

December  , \n\n\nAnd I 'll start writing\n\n\nHopefully submit the final paper by March of next year\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh  \n\n\nOh that 's good\n\n\n  So you are  very focused\n\n<$B> \n\n Thank you  \n\n<$A> \n\nOh as always you are very organized\n\n<$B> \n\n  Thank you \n\n<$A> \n\n Systematic   and focused\n\n\nSo that means by next school year we will be classmates in the P H\nD\n\n<$B> \n\nI still don 't have any plans\n\n<$A> \n\nFor P H D you mean\n\n<$B> \n\nNot for now\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh uhm what about <unclear> words </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nUh I just I 'll see what will happen\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh so you want to what spend perhaps your life with more\nexciting things\n\n<$B> \n\nUh nothing exciting for the moment\n\n\n  Not  no no no ideas for now\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-hmmmh  \n\n\nUh okay\n\n<$B> \n\nSo what would you like to ask me\n\n<$A> \n\n I I saw one time all about your what 's that\narts\n\n\nWhat 's that your drawings sketches   sketches \n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   oh yes\n\n<$A> \n\nSo why why aren 't you doing sketches anymore this time\n\n<$B> \n\nTo be quite honest with you my schedule is very busy\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh it requires a lot of uh focus  ,  time and\nhard work\n\n\nSo it 's almost impossible to release it down to sketch\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-hmmmh  \n\n\nI see\n\n<$B> \n\nPlus the fact that I have a lot of papers to check and a lot\nof students to meet\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I understand\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nUsually what mood do you need so that you can start any sketch\n\n<$B> \n\nI I can 't exactly define the mood but it 's it 's just when it\noccurs it 's there and then you you sort of sit down but it 's it comes\nregularly when when, when uh you you start doing it\n\n\nSo it goes on and on for a month or so\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n<$B> \n\nBut if you talk about mood in terms of days and any time of\nthe year it 's almost impossible\n\n<$A> \n\nI see I see\n\n\nBut do you need let us say uhm do you need say a bottle of beer or\na cup of coffee   to keep you  going or something like that\n\n<$B> \n\n No  \n\n\nNot necessarily\n\n<$A> \n\nOh not necessarily\n\n\nSo what prompts you to let 's say get your paper and pencil and uh\nstart sketching\n\n<$B> \n\nSometimes I see other people 's work and uh,\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nSomething comes up in my head and uh sometimes I say oh I can\ndo something like this or I can I think I can do something better than this\nor I think I have an idea brewing somewhere\n\n\nSo   that 's it \n\n<$A> \n\n I see  \n\n\nWhat about love\n\n\nIs it a good motivator you think\n\n\nLove\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm it 's never worked for me\n\n<$A> \n\nOh oh why,\n\n\nUhm that 's something unusual uh I thought for artists   it 's\n\n\n<$B> \n\n Sometimes  \n\n\nI cannot recall any instance in the past where love was really an\ninspiration for  ,  you know a force in my work\n\n\nBut it 's very hard to really explain what what would be an\ninspiration\n\n\nIt 's just that you have an itch inside you and you wanna do it you\nwanna sketch and that 's it\n\n\nIt doesn 't have to come from anyone\n\n\nIt doesn 't have to come from anywhere\n\n\nIt just occurs\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh really  \n\n\nI see I see\n\n\nWhat about if you are depressed\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm sorry\n\n<$A> \n\nIf if you are depressed   depressed \n\n<$B> \n\n Sometimes   depression yes\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nDepression is, is uh is a driving force\n\n\nIt 's quite powerful in fact because   you \n\n<$A> \n\n Even more powerful than   love\n\n<$B> \n\nYou find a way of expressing the you know the frustrations\nthe depression the negative feeling and sometimes they come out in in work\neither in sketches so oh yeah if you could consider you could consider it uh\na force as well to reckon with\n\n<$A> \n\nOh so  ,  have you sketched uh anything before\nin which you were depressed\n\n<$B> \n\n Uhm   Yes\n\n\nIn fact when I was raped\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen you were raped  you were raped\n\n\nI want you to expound on that what do you mean, uh physically\nemotionally\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen you are when you are violated\n\n<$A> \n\nOh that 's what you mean\n\n<$B> \n\nFor the first time you cannot sleep\n\n\nYou wake up at three in the morning staring at the ceiling\n\n<$A> \n\nWow\n\n\nI can imagine uh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd it 's hard to talk to people because people are not always\n<,> you think people are not always understanding and open to your you know\nexperiences and you just keep to yourself and you don 't know where to run for\nhelp\n\n<$A> \n\nOh oh you   sound  very emotional\n\n<$B> \n\n So  \n\n\nDrawing and sketching can be a very good release\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nSome of the negative vibes vibrations that you get from very\nunpleasant experiences\n\n<$A> \n\nI understand\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$A> \n\nYou sound very emotional today  \nJimmy  huh\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I 'm just a little bit serious today that 's all\n\n\nI have a back that 's killing me\n\n<$A> \n\n Oh yeah\n\n\nI understand\n\n\nSo when do you plan to I mean get another sheet of paper and start\n  uh \n\n<$B> \n\n Uhm   maybe when I retire that 's about ten years\nfrom now\n\n<$A> \n\nOh don 't tell me you 'll go back to sketching only when you\nretire\n\n<$B> \n\nYes because I want to sit comfortably in a nice house\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nIn a garden perhaps   where I  don 't have to think\nabout checking papers\n\n<$A> \n\n  Wow  \n\n<$B> \n\nTalking to students who are begging me to change their grades\n or I have to put up with with a P H D you know P\nH D courses none of those things\n\n<$A> \n\nUh so are you telling me that you don 't really consider\ntaking P H D course\n\n<$B> \n\n  I 'm not saying ,\n\n<$A> \n\n I mean in the years   to come\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm closing my doors to that\n\n\nIt could be\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nI can consider that as an option\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nBut it 's not like it 's not like it 's number one in my list\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n\nWhat about love life\n\n<$B> \n\nLove life\n\n\nI haven 't had one in a long time\n\n\nYou have any suggestions\n\n<$A> \n\n Oh \n\n\nYou want uh what a blunt answer to that\n\n<$B> \n\nWell, I 'm not too sure it 's good to discuss that on the\nphone\n\n\nMaybe over a cup   of  coffee   sometime\n \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah  \n\n\n True true  \n\n\nYeah I look forward to that\n\n\nI look forward to that\n\n\nOkay that 's interesting you know\n\n\nUh-hmmmh uh   what about  \n\n<$B> \n\n Talking about   love life I I think it 's nice to\nhave one\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah you were telling me you have not had that love life for\nquite sometime already\n\n\nWhat about\n\n<$B> \n\nWell how can you have a love life if you sit on a desk \n facing  a lot of books a lot of people who talk about theories\n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm  \n\n\nBut you can always insert that in your busy schedule dear\n\n<$B> \n\nYes but if you 're so busy you have no time to go to the\n burol  or the funeral or you have no time to go to the malls\nand you have no time to gimmick so  ,  how do you expect to meet\npeople\n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm  \n\n\nSo how do you\n\n<$B> \n\nBut I 'm trying to think about that now lately\n\n\nIt 's been it 's probably time for me to start you know  \nrelaxing  a bit\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh uh-hmmmh so  finally  \n\n\nOkay so what prompted you to at least have that idea again\n\n<$B> \n\nWell, I think I need some time for myself\n\n<$A> \n\nAny <unclear> 1 word </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nNot could you suggest one\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I 'll tell you over a cup of coffee as I said a while ago\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I think that cup of coffee is is is well anticipated\n\n<$A> \n\nUh true true\n\n\nUh anyway uh so what will you do after this one\n\n<$B> \n\nAfter what\n\n<$A> \n\nAfter     uh yeah our conversation\n\n<$B> \n\n After \n\n\nWell I 'm going straight to the hospital and get my examination\nbecause my back has been killing me for three or four days  ,  I\ncan hardly move and it 's painful\n\n<$A> \n\n I see  \n\n\nYeah last Saturday you also complained about that right\n\n<$B> \n\nExactly it 's been chronic\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich is why I went to see a doctor yesterday\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I hope that 's not because of old age \n\n<$B> \n\nWell it definitely has nothing to do with old age I think\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n<$B> \n\nProbably something else\n\n<$A> \n\nFatigue overwork perhaps\n\n<$B> \n\nI I can 't tell\n\n\nI don 't really know\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's already a sign that you have to give yourself a break\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nRelax wind up go somewhere\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo uhm tomorrow uhm is

\n\nAnd we had a quiz\n\n\nAfter that uh I was the presenter\n\n\nI had a report\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh how was your report\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm quite good quite well just alright\n\n\nI was not able to finish the presentation I had to cut it because\nit was already time\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nI was able to present only about half of of all the slides\nthat I prepared\n\n<$A> \n\nOh really\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd you know the L C D didn\u0092t work\n\n\nYou know you really can\u0092t count on these I T gadgets and all these\nstuffs\n\n\nIt didn\u0092t work and so I asked my my classmates or good we were only\naround nine   nine or  ten to just compress around the laptop\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh  \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then they were they were actually craning just to see the\nthe screen   okay \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh  \n\n\nSo they had difficulty   looking at  your visuals\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   true true\n\n\nBut at least they enjoyed\n\n\nThey enjoyed the presentation I guess\n\n\n  Well I guess \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah well dear   you 're a total performer\n\n<$B> \n\nOh thank you dear\n\n\n  Anyway \n\n<$A> \n\n You 're welcome  \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd so that 's why at this very moment I I 'm so exhausted\n\n\nI really wanna eat or wind up or go somewhere\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh I think I 'm kinda hungry too\n\n<$B> \n\nOh what about uh Robinson 's uh Cinnzeo\n\n<$A> \n\nYes <unclear> words </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I wanna indulge, ice cream or cake or coffee or just\nplain coffee\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat do you think\n\n<$A> \n\nThat would be great\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nI love their cinnamon roll\n\n<$B> \n\nOh, I I kinda uh what I 'm smelling it already the the\ncinnamon\n\n\nWow\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah the butter   and the chocolate  the nuts\n\n<$B> \n\n And the butter  \n\n\nAnd  and then while while drinking coffee we 'll talk\nabout semantics \n\n<$A> \n\nOh yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd pragmatics\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah your presentation about Semantics\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah uhm okay you know what 's that\n\n\nI wanna I wanna  watch a film but oh my God it 's what\n's this it 's still Metro Manila Week right\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah it 's the Manila Film Fest\n\n<$B> \n\nUh the Manila Film Festival\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd no English films being shown\n\n<$A> \n\n Nada  none\n\n<$B> \n\n Ha \n\n\nSo of course I wouldn\u0092t watch Volta or whatever\n\n<$A> \n\n But I heard it 's the top grosser so far\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich one Volta\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah Volta\n\n<$B> \n\nOh, okay so pathetic\n\n\nAnyway uhm, hey uhm speaking about films which reminds me you\nknow what I I where where did I see that\n\n\nI think it 's in the internet I I I read something like a review of\nthe Troy the movie\n\n\nRemember that Brad Pitt Troy\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah yeah I 've watched it too\n\n<$B> \n\nOh but of course\n\n\nI was a bit confused with the you know uhm the introduction or\nsomething about Troy actually the background\n\n\nPerhaps you can shed light you know you 're the authority here when\nit comes to literature\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-hmmmh uh\n\n<$A> \n\nWell actually that movie is a compressed version of different\nliterary works\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat what different\n\n\nYou mean it was not only based from Iliad\n\n<$A> \n\nNo the Iliad talks about the tenth year of the war up to the\ndeath of Hector\n\n<$B> \n\nOh oh\n\n\nThat 's something new huh\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A> \n\nBut even prior to that there were already works that pertained\nto the gods the goddesses and the heroes of Troy and Greece\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-hmmmh uh-hmmmh\n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe what the producers of the movie Troy did was they\ncompressed everything into a single commercialized film with a romantic plot\nand all the works\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yes oh yes\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> to impress viewers so they would\nenjoy it\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-hmmmh uh-hmmmh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd there were a lot of differences   <unclear> words\n</unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah actually   there were a lot of what,\ndifferences okay\n\n\nWell what I know only is the Iliad\n\n\nI I don\u0092t know the one you were telling me is that it was based\nfrom many works so aside from Iliad\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm so what there were there are some confusing parts there\nlike uh uh a lot of them were able to escape from Troy is that true\n\n<$A> \n\nNo that 's not true because\n\n<$B> \n\nIsn\u0092t it it 's only  what 's that Aeneas right\n\n<$A> \n\nAeneas\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nThe father and his son were the only men who escaped from\nTroy\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's according to Iliad\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no not that 's not in the Iliad\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$A> \n\nThe later work by a Greek poet\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see\n\n\nBut according to Iliad it was only Aeneas who was able to escape\nright\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A> \n\nThe women they were the women they all became concubines of\nthe Greeks\n\n<$B> \n\nOh Briseis\n\n\nBriseis became also a concubine you mean\n\n<$A> \n\nBriseis\n\n<$B> \n\nBriseis\n\n<$A> \n\nI forgot\n\n<$B> \n\nThe love interest of of Achilles Achilles\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nDid she die, at the end I don\u0092t remember anymore\n\n\nUh Briseis\n\n<$A> \n\nIn the movie she didn\u0092t die\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-hmmmh she escaped right\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah she was able to escape  ,  the pillaging of\nthe  of the Greeks\n\n\nBut in the in Greek literature I forgot what happened to her\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh-huh  \n\n\nOh I see okay and what what else\n\n\nUhm who who is now the character of Legolas\n\n\nWhat was the character being\n\n<$A> \n\nParis\n\n<$B> \n\nParis Paris what about Paris\n\n\nWasn\u0092t that the start actually the start of the Troy like uhm of\ncourse he abducted Helen right\n\n<$A> \n\nHe abducted Helen and uh took her to Troy\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n\nWas it was it like that in in Iliad\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah it was also like that\n\n<$B> \n\nNo because in the film I remember in the film uh uh like uh\nParis and Helen were like romantically linked right\n\n\nBut in the original version in Iliad Helen was actually given to\nParis as a gift\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yeah   by  Aphrodite\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah  \n\n\nBy Aphrodite\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay or or what 's this it 's not actually a gift or a bribe\n<,> for choosing her as the\n\n<$A> \n\nFor choosing her as the most\n\n<$B> \n\nAs the fairest woman\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah her <unclear> words </unclear> Hera and Athena\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah Athena\n\n\nBut in the film okay uhm it it looks like Paris and Helen had what\nhad an affair an illicit affair and so\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah because in the, in Greek literature when Paris came\nto, Sparta\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A> \n\nMenelaus wasn\u0092t there so he had the chance to abduct Helen\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$A> \n\nBut in the movie he saw there Menelaus   and Hector\n\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah  \n\n<$A> \n\nThey were all in Sparta but actually it 's not true\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\nIt didn\u0092t really happen\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I see\n\n\nOkay uhm another part in the film that which I enjoyed not really\nI enjoyed or which I remember\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nBased from the Iliad is the fight between Hector and Achilles\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nHow did you find that\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nThat   was sexy right \n\n<$A> \n\n It 's a very realistic   portrayal\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat about the what about the performance of Achilles there\nlike or or Achilles or he was he was kinda dancing\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah they were like dancing flamingoes \n\n<$B> \n\nOkay it was like what\n\n<$A> \n\nIt was like a choreographed fight\n\n<$B> \n\nA choreographed fight\n\n\nI I was supposed to say that  a choreographed fight\n\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh okay\n\n\nAnd then in the original version Achilles was supposed to drag the\nbody of Hector inside uh Troy right inside the walls of Troy right\n\n<$A> \n\nNo it was uh when Patroclus was killed by Hector they created\na funeral pyre for him\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then when Achilles killed Hector he dragged\n\n<$B> \n\nThe body of\n\n<$A> \n\nThe body to their camp to the Greek camp\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's already in the film but in the original version\naround Troy\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no not around Troy\n\n<$B> \n\nAround the walls\n\n<$A> \n\nDragged Hector 's body around Patroclus ' funeral fire\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I   see \n\n<$A> \n\n Funeral   pyre for eleven days\n\n<$B> \n\nI see I see\n\n\nOkay uh-huh\n\n\nBut originally I mean did the did the father of, Priam did King\nPriam really retrieve the body of Hector in the original version\n\n<$A> \n\nHe was able to go to the Greek camps because Hermes helped\nthem Hermes is the messenger of the gods\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah yeah Hermes of course I remember\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah he was able to cloak Priam\n\n<$B> \n\nOh\n\n<$A> \n\n Disguise him so  he was able to go to Achilles ' camp\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A> \n\nBut in the movie the gods were absent none of them were there\n\n<$B> \n\nYes yes yes which makes the movie realistic right\n\n\nOkay because there were no gods or or goddesses in the film right\n\n\nThere  there was a uh mention of it okay but just a\nmention right\n\n\nThey didn\u0092t appear\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's the liberty of the director to do what he wants so\nthat the movie will be commercially viable\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n\nOh true uhm okay so that 's all about Troy\n\n\nI 'm waiting actually for the Spiderman Two\n\n<$A> \n\nI am waiting for that one   too \n\n<$B> \n\n Oh   what about uh watching it together or with\nTina perhaps what about that\n\n<$A> \n\nOh sure\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'm sure we 'll enjoy watching it\n\n<$B> \n\nWell that is of course if we don\u0092t have assignment in our\nsubjects or   if I won\u0092t be preparing \n\n<$A> \n\n Or we have no paper to check  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah no paper to check or if we have no reports or no\nresearch work you know\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm uhm okay\n\n\nWhat is this\n\n\nWhere 's Tina\n\n\nDo you know where Tina is\n\n<$A> \n\nI think she 's reading a book\n\n<$B> \n\nOh book all about\n\n<$A> \n\nI don\u0092t know I can\u0092t\n\n<$B> \n\nShe 's reading a book again\n\n\nWe just came from our classes and we read uh a great deal again of\nof what all about concepts and ideas\n\n\nAnd she 's reading a book again\n\n\nWhat could that be\n\n<$A> \n\nUh she wants <unclear> words </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nActually I haven\u0092t I haven\u0092t started the Harry Potter Five\n\n<$A> \n\n  Uh-huh \n\n<$B> \n\n As much as I   want to\n\n\nIt 's there on my table have you seen it\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's so thick\n\n\nHow can I start it\n\n\nI still have what I still have one report to do in Semantics\n\n\nI still have to do a paper in Corpus\n\n\nOh I can\u0092t afford to read anymore Book Five of Harry Potter \n although I really want to \n\n<$A> \n\n So reading for you   has become   reading\n has become a luxury for you\n\n<$B> \n\n Harry Potter is  \n\n\nOh yeah yeah \n\n\nI do it while I 'm in the bus you know\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nOr while I 'm inside the C R yeah\n\n<$A> \n\n  Oh \n\n<$B> \n\n That 's   when I can read okay\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut when I 'm here in school or in the class oh I have to\ncheck paper or read assignments or review or what do a paper oh or stuff like\nthose\n\n<$A> \n\nWell my friends also collect Harry Potter books and they\nthink they enjoy it\n\n\nI don\u0092t know why because I haven\u0092t read any   of the Harry\nPotter \n\n<$B> \n\n I was telling   you already to start reading them\n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe you can convince me to read them <unclear> words\n</unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\nOh I 'm always doing that one dear \n\n\nI 'm just telling you to start reading  okay\n\n<$A> \n\nI don\u0092t know I can\u0092t find any reason   to read \n\n<$B> \n\n You have to start   with Harry Potter One\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat about the first book\n\n<$B> \n\nOr what you can do perhaps is to watch the film first\n\n\nI can lend you One and Two I have them with me One and Two the\nfilm and then uh read Books One and Two and then you compare\n\n\nAnd you 'd love also Three Harry Potter Three\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Harry Potter Four is already very thick\n\n\n  But have you \n\n<$A> \n\n I have seen   Harry Potter One but I haven\u0092t seen\nHarry Potter Two\n\n<$B> \n\nBut you have watched uh Harry Potter One\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah   yeah \n\n<$B> \n\n That 's still   the best version of all uh in my\nown perception\n\n\nThe Harry Potter Two uhm not really the Three I hate it\n\n<$A> \n\n  Uh-huh \n\n<$B> \n\n The Three   I think is the worst version\n\n\nThe Harry Potter One is still the best\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah that 's my own perception\n\n\nAnyway what else uh so when when will the regular showing resume\n\n\nLike after this week we can already have English films\n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe after Gloria 's proclamation\n\n<$B> \n\nOh that means uh uh what July one  until uh\nThursday you mean\n\n<$A> \n\nMaybe June thirty June thirty or July one\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm when is the what about the Manila Film Festival uh what\n's this now award awards awards night something like that\n\n<$A> \n\nI don\u0092t know\n\n\nI don\u0092t know the schedule but I think it will be held at the P I C\nC or C C P\n\n<$B> \n\nBut uh when will that be\n\n\nWhat I 'm after actually is the Star Talk version of that   ,  the <title> Tigbak Authority </title> that 's\nwhy I 'm interested because if if the awards night is already finished that\nmeans I 'll I 'll

the Star Talk okay especially when\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I also enjoy the <title> Tigbak Authority </title> you\nknow\n\n<$B> \n\nIf the subject is all about the outfit during awards night I\nlove that\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah \n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm waiting for that and I was saying I was saying hey there\n's another awards night\n\n\nAnd I look forward to the <title> Tigbak Authority </title>\nversion of this one\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah it 's really very funny\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm and I like the you know  okray okrayan \npart\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnyway  hey you wanna eat now\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B>

{"text": "<$A> \n\nI will describe some of the methodologies used  'no  so that you have an idea of what kind of research goes into these types of topics okay, \n\n\nNow uhm I 'm not I I remember when I gave a talk last time I don't consider myself primarily a psycholinguistics a psycholinguist  'no  \n\n\nI 'm sort of a closet psycholinguist\n\n\nUh I I took courses with  uh with psycholinguists but I never really established a uh continuous research program in psycholinguistics  'no  \n\n\nAlthough I have always included language variables in my researches\n\n\nSo, actually the when I was trying to think of topics to write these were like my wish list the things I should have been doing\n\n\nBut but uh maybe you would be in a stronger position to look at these topics\n\n\nUh I got interested in language research in psychology mainly because of the bilingual experience of Filipino  'no  \n\n\nUhm and so my entry point into language research is bilingualism and uh most of the topics that I will be rattling off start off from bilingualism\n\n\nNow uhm first there will be several clusters of topics here and the first thing that I thought you might find more interesting or you might be able to identify more easily is the implications of bilingualism to education\n\n\nWe have a bilingual policy\n\n\nUhm the reality is most of the teachers code-switch in the classrooms\n\n\nMany of our students are at least  or almost all are at least bilingual\n\n\nMany are multilingual uh polyglots  'no  \n\n\nUhm one question that has gotten a lot of attention is what is the consequence of using either the first language or the second language or the third language to learning to thinking in the education process\n\n\nUhm there have been studies and I 'm sure Brother Andrew talked about them of the consequences or the impact of bilingual education\n\n\nBut as psychologists we have to focus on the more micro effects\n\n\nWhat I mean by that is how did using the child 's or the student 's first or second language affect his or her learning of a particular subject matter\n\n\nSo it 's focused more on the individual 's uh learning or thinking  'no  \n\n\nNow when we do that in cognitive psychology we tend to be very very focused in terms of the cognitive abilities involved\n\n\nFor example since most of you are language teachers  'no  you might be interested in reading\n\n\nUh how is it for example that students come to develop reading skills in Filipino or English\n\n\nDoes it make a difference if we teach our young children to read in English or Filipino or does it not make a difference at all\n\n\nYou must have heard of some of the studies done in this line  'no  \n\n\nBut uh what I want to start thinking of maybe is look at reading not as a global function but a unitary function\n\n\nLook at reading as an activity that has many many different smaller parts\n\n\nFor example reading actually involves at the most basic level word recognition pattern recognition\n\n\nThis is a very perceptual process  'no  \n\n\nAt a higher level it involves understanding meaning, literal meaning of the text\n\n\nAt an even higher level it involves making inferences\n\n\nIt will also involve applying information things like that  'no  \n\n\nSo some researches a student of mine for example looked at uh, how, I think she studied kindergarten or grade one children uh perform as regards these four levels of uh reading comprehension\n\n\nShe found out that as far as uh uh word recognition was concerned, what made a more important impact was the language used for teaching, \n\n\nAnd uh we think it 's because word recognition is primarily a perceptual process\n\n\nSo if you have more experience with words in uh printed words in English you would be much better uh at recognizing them\n\n\nSimply because you have more experience processing these types of words printed words\n\n\nWhen it came to comprehension, literal inferential and applying information students always did better with their first language\n\n\nBut these were early learners remember these are people who were just starting to read  'no  \n\n\nUh there were similar findings done by uh an Ateneo researcher\n\n\nAnd this time she studied, uh students with three languages Cebuano English and Filipino\n\n\nAnd the results were pretty much similar but she focused on comprehension\n\n\nComprehension was really better in the  first language\n\n\nMost of these studies have been done with early learners  'no  \n\n\nI am not familiar with them, I 'm not familiar with other studies that look at higher level learners  'no  \n\n\nAnd uh maybe later on we can look at other variables  \n\n\nOkay, so I was talking about you know uh, possible things I was just talking about reading  'no  \n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nUh and then you can think of other things that you might be interested in when looking at reading  'no  \n\n\nFor example if you look at reading fiction, you can look at uh whether students are better able to make inferences about motives of the character  'no  \n\n\nAre they able to uh understand subtext or subplots better  'no  \n\n\nAre they able better able to establish motivation certain events things like that  'no  \n\n\nUh, are they better able to appreciate literary works\n\n\nAre they better able to uh see nuances  'no  in the narrative structure things like that\n\n\nThis would be for more advanced students because earlier we were talking about early readers  'no  \n\n\nYou can look at very specific things like how do they  interpret symbols  'no  \n\n\nAre they better able to to appreciate metaphor, in their first language in their second language\n\n\nThat 's just reading\n\n\nYou can look at writing also,  'no  \n\n\nAre they are are they better able to uh, do exposition in English or Filipino\n\n\nThere 's a lot of anecdotal evidence or or anecdotes from teachers who say that when their students write in their first language tends to be more tends to be richer tends to be more original\n\n\nAnd when they write in English they tend to be more clich\u00e9 they tend to resort to stock phrases things like that, \n\n\nMaybe these things need to be documented rather than just relying on stock or anecdotes  'no  \n\n\nYou can look at their expressiveness\n\n\nMaybe uh the range of techniques they use when they write is uh wider for one language or the other we don't know that yet we don't know these things  'no  \n\n\nYou can also look at the depth of their ideas  'no  \n\n\nThese are the kinds of things that you know people always talk about\n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nYou know my student writes better and this and that\n\n\nBut you know we have not done the research that will support these types of uh conjectures  'no  \n\n\nAside from the task we notice I was looking mainly at the task you can look at the variables related to the learner\n\n\nWhat do you mean by that\n\n\nWell we all know not all bilinguals are alike  'no  \n\n\nThere are so you can look at the types of bilinguals\n\n\nYou have, uh, simultaneous bilinguals those who grew up listening to two languages or three languages\n\n\nYou have additive bilinguals subtractive bilinguals  'no  \n\n\nYou have multilinguals of course\n\n\nThat that creates a totally different situation altogether\n\n\nSo you can consider a range of variables related to the learner as regards  level of proficiency  'no  in L one and L two\n\n\nThat might make a big difference  'no  \n\n\nYou can consider things like level of knowledge of the subject area\n\n\nUhm I sometimes think that people who are experts in a field could not be as dependent on language  'no  \n\n\nThey if if they know the subject matter very well they would not be as constrained when it comes to talking about these things  'no  \n\n\nSo that 's one layer of studies that you can do\n\n\nJust looking at whether it makes a difference to use English or Filipino when it comes to these very specific aspects, actually focus on language skills  'no  \n\n\nBut if you look at how they do uh my work is in mathematics so I look at how these things affect mathematical tasks\n\n\nYou can look at how they appreciate history\n\n\nYou can look at how they appreciate uh their studies in religion  'no  \n\n\nThis can apply to any of our uh subject matter, \n\n\nThe methodology usually involves a simple comparison  'no  \n\n\nSame group of subjects two sets of stimulus or two sets of tasks one in L one in L two or another in L three\n\n\nAnd then just compare the performance afterwards\n\n\nSo it 's rather straightforward in terms of research design\n\n\nOf course if you will if you will deal with the learner variable it will involve different groups\n\n\nAnd so you can then combine maybe learner variables with task variables\n\n\nMore complicated research design there\n\n\nBut you might get more rich information uh richer\n\n\nNow another layer of studies still related to bilingualism and pushing it a bit higher is trying to find out not only what the differences are but trying to find out why those differences exist\n\n\nSo let 's say they do better at appreciating metaphor in Filipino then you might want to know why\n\n\nIs it something about the Filipino language\n\n\nIs it something about their proficiency\n\n\nIs it something about the text for example  'no  \n\n\nSo it is not sufficient that we say students do better in English or in Filipino\n\n\nThe next step of studies would have the next step of studies would deal with the question why do we see these things  'no  \n\n\nBecause I always feel that why is always more convincing  'no  \n\n\nIt is much more satisfying in terms of providing explanations\n\n\nOf course this is much more difficult to do\n\n\nYou have to generate hypothesis\n\n\nYou have to try to get data either to verify or disprove your hypothesis\n\n\nBut this is the fun part\n\n\nIn my work in the area of math it 's trying to make sense of the pattern of the results that is always more it 's much more creative it 's much more challenging so I would be <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n\nYou know it 's everyone has an idea of why it 's better with one <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nIt 's a matter of testing it, in ways in which you can you know reasonably conclude this hypothesis and not that hypothesis\n\n\nSo and then, another set of studies would be related to, still related to the why but it will require a finer analysis of English and Filipino as languages\n\n\nThat would require well I suppose they have courses in\n\n<$B> \n\nLinguistics \n\n<$A> \n\nEnglish syntax like that  'no  \n\n<$B> \n\nYes \n\n<$A> \n\nBy that I mean you can begin looking at the different structures of language or the two languages from the most basic the phonology, \n\n\nMaybe that has something to do with it\n\n\nMaybe the lexicon has something to do with it  'no  \n\n\nOr maybe it 's the syntax that has something to do with it\n\n\nThe most exciting studies in this area had looked into syntactic and semantic differences in L one and L two and predicting differential performance of learning\n\n<$B> \n\nOh who are these who are these uh \n\n<$A> \n\nOh uh there are actually few and far between\n\n\nUh I 'm trying to think of a study that would be illustrative, \n\n\nLet 's see, \n\n\nYou see many of the studies I don't understand  \n\n\nBecause it 's a comparison of English and Korean  oo 'yon na nga 'yon na nga  Turkish and English\n\n\nBut for example uh okay one of one professor I was working with, was comparing Spanish and English, okay and Spanish seems to have,  'no  uh this is I can't remember exactly what she has done\n\n\nShe hasn't published it yet so I cannot\n\n\nBut give me one minute I 'm sure I can give you an example, \n\n\nUh, uh okay\n\n\nIn Italian in a lot of the Romance languages, they have gender markers\n\n\nFor the verbs you know everything  'no  \n\n\nSo in a set a sentence in uh, in English would have maybe just one word that marks the gender <130> In the same sentence in Italian you 'd have three gender markers\n\n\nIt marks the verb everything  'no  \n\n\nAnd so some people speculate that well does that make the Italian reader uh, more mindful of factors related to gender\n\n\nI don't I 'm not sure if that study has been done but I know someone has been talking about that\n\n\nSomething that has been\n\n<$B> \n\nSapir-Whorf hypothesis  'no  \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah that 's it people are testing Sapir-Whorf in a very very fine-tuned way\n\n\nOne very good demonstration and this one I understood  \n\n\nUh this was done by people collaboration of American and Hong Kong psychologists  'no  \n\n\nAnd uh this is not related to literature in any way but it might be\n\n\nIt turns out there are words in English that refer to personality constructs that we have a happy-go-lucky personality we have an extrovert  'no  which embodies a set of personality traits okay\n\n\nIt turns out there are no counterparts in Chinese okay\n\n\nBut in the Chinese language they have also their own set of terms that correspond to a, set of personality traits\n\n\nUh one term she gave refers to someone who is very creative outgoing but very close to the family,  'no  \n\n\nIt 's a different complex okay\n\n\nIn a study they did they came up with a story, which describes a person okay\n\n\nAnd from there you can infer the subjects were required to, make an inference about the personality of the individual what other personality traits would this person have okay\n\n\nThe same text was given to, monolingual Chinese monolingual English speakers bilingual English-Chinese speakers, \n\n\nUh the Chinese and bilingual speakers were from Hong Kong Hong Kong Chinese\n\n\nThe English speakers were British, okay\n\n\nUh, interesting first interesting comparison was that when they looked at the sets of traits inferred by the monolinguals they found a totally different set\n\n\nThe ones who read the text in English the monolingual British speakers English speakers describe these people according to the English stereotypical term okay, \n\n\nThe monolingual Chinese described these results consistent with the Chinese terms but they were reading the same story\n\n\nThey were reading the same, information\n\n\nBut the constructs that were evoked were determined by which lexical units were activated\n\n\nBut you might say well these were British compared to monolingual Chinese in Hong Kong and if you know anything about Hong Kong the monolingual  the monolingual Chinese are probably not very cosmopolitan  'no  \n\n\nYou might say it 's cultural differences,  'no  \n\n\nSo the interesting comparison now would be the bilinguals\n\n\nHow could the bilinguals read the text in English half read it in Chinese and you find the same difference\n\n<$B> \n\nUh it 's the language so there 's something \n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's the language\n\n\nAnd so the same the bilingual the same pool of bilinguals they have the same culture pretty much homogeneous experience, come up with a different personality description if they read it in Chinese compared if when they read it in English, \n\n\nThat 's a very powerful description  'no  \n\n\nUh I I 'm trying hard to think of a parallel study that can be done in the Philippines\n\n\nAnd it 's it 's not something that I have enough time to think about no but some people have been thinking along these lines  'no  \n\n\nBut something like that\n\n\nIn that case it was the lexicon that they were looking at\n\n\nSo there were lexical entries in English that did not have counterparts in Chinese and vice versa\n\n\nAnd it had an impact on person perception\n\n\nAnd this is not far a far cry from inferring motives of uh fictional characters for example\n\n\nAnd there are other studies that relate to you know relating syntax\n\n\nMost of these are, extreme examples\n\n\nUh okay now I remember one\n\n\nThere is this controversial set of studies done by Bloom\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich Bloom \n\n<$A> \n\nNot Harold Bloom\n\n\nI think it 's Harold Bloom\n\n\nAnyway\n\n\nBut he he said that in the Chinese language there is no conditional\n\n<$B> \n\n\" If if \" \n\n<$A> \n\n\" If \" \n\n\nAnd he says because of that Chinese speakers cannot reason with a condition\n\n<$B> \n\nOh my God \n\n<$A> \n\nSomething like that\n\n<$B> \n\nIf x and y they cannot do that but it 's very basic in Philosophy  di ba  \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah something like that\n\n\nAnd he has some data showing that effect\n\n\nOther studies have been trying to show you have bad data you know you did not phrase the Chinese\n\n\nHe was not a native Chinese Speaker so his phrasing was not appropriate and things like that  'no  \n\n\nSo you you can extend it but that requires very fine knowledge of the language, you know and the types of differences\n\n\nAnd the the thing is if you look at, Filipino, based on Tagalog the syntax is very different\n\n\nWell they come from very different families  'no", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThe reason of Immanuel Kant\n\n\nThus far we have seen the uhm two kinds of knowledge, or judgement according to source, namely\n\n<$B> \n\n  A priori  and  a posteriori  \n\n<$A> \n\nAlright  a priori  and  a posteriori , \n\n\nIf you were asked to  to define the two types of knowledge how would you\n\n\nWhat is an  a priori  knowledge against an  a posteriori  knowledge, \n\n\nYes Mister <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$C> \n\n A priori  knowledge is <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nAlright so it has something to do with what is the source of that knowledge where we uhm acquire this knowledge either from experience in which case it is  a posteriori  or from reason from the mind itself in which case it is  a priori  \n\n\nWe have also uhm seen that there are two kinds of judgement according to the relationship, of a subject and a predicate\n\n\nAnd what are they, \n\n\nYes\n\n<$D> \n Either synthetic or analytic\n\n<$A> \n\nAlright it could either be synthetic or analytic\n\n\nAnd how would you differentiate them\n\n\nUh yes\n\n<$E> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nAlright\n\n\nSo if the predicate is already contained in the subject you call it, \n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd if the predicate is not yet contained in the subject you call it synthetic\n\n\nCould you give me examples\n\n\nFirst of an analytic proposition, where the predicate is already contained in the subject\n\n\nYes\n\n<$E> \n\nA square has four equal sides\n\n<$A> \n\nPardon\n\n<$E> \n\nA square\n\n<$A> \n\nA square has four equal sides\n\n\nCould you give me an example of a synthetic judgement, \n\n\nYes\n\n<$F> \n\nThe triangle is small\n\n<$A> \n\nThe triangle is small\n\n\nNo matter how hard you look at the triangle you would study the concept of triangle it wouldn't tell you that whether it is uh big or small and so you must have gotten the idea of \" small \" somewhere else\n\n\nFine\n\n\nThen combining the two the two classifications of knowledge we have uh the kinds of judgement\n\n\nHow many kinds of judgement are there altogether\n\n\nThere are three kinds of judgements namely\n\n\nYes\n\n<$G> \n\n Uhm analytic  a priori  synthetic  a posteriori  and synthetic  a priori  \n\n<$A> \n\nGood\n\n\nSo analytic  a priori , synthetic  a posteriori , and synthetic,  a priori , \n\n\nCould you give me an example of the first, an analytic  a priori  judgement,  yes\n\n<$H> \n\n  A circle is round  \n\n<$A> \n\nAlright\n\n\nIf I say a circle is round, that is analytic  a priori  \n\n\nCould you explain why, \n\n\nFirst explain why it is  a priori  and not  a posteriori  then explain why it is synthetic or analytic or you can do it the other way around\n\n\nYou can first start with why it is analytic and then why it is  a priori , \n\n\nNo one, \n\n\nYes\n\n<$I> \n\nUh Sir uhm what do you call this uhm analytic because uh the predicate is is contained already in the subject\n\n<$A> \n\nAlright the predicate is already contained in the subject\n\n\nTrue\n\n\nEven if you remove the predicate just by looking at the subject \" circle \" you know right away it should be round\n\n\nOkay so the predicate is already contained in the subject, \n\n\nThen why is it  a priori  \n\n<$I> \n\nUhm Sir because uhm we already know that a circle is round\n\n<$A> \n\nFrom reason we don't have to go beyond reason beyond the concept itself okay\n\n\nWe don't need experience to know that a circle is round\n\n\nThe very concept the concept is uh is uh from the mind okay\n\n\nThe very concept is close to the idea that it is round\n\n\nAnd so the source is uh not necessarily from from experience\n\n\nOf course when I draw a circle on the board and I say look that circle\n\n\nIt 's not really a circle is it\n\n\nThat circle is small\n\n\nThen it is from experience\n\n\nIt is  a posteriori  \n\n\nBut if I just say a circle is round I don't mean any any circle in particular\n\n\nThe circle is round\n\n\nThe very definition of a circle\n\n\nThen the source is reason itself\n\n\nIt is  a priori  okay\n\n\nSo uh we have the first type of judgement an analytic  a priori  judgement\n\n\nI don't think there is there is any uh great problem about analytic  a priori  judgement\n\n\nUsually our definitions, are analytic  a priori  judgements okay\n\n\nI don't think there is any much problem here\n\n\nThere 's also not much problem about the second one synthetic  a posteriori  judgement\n\n\nCould you uhm explain it\n\n<$J> \n\nUhm Sir uhm right now the wall is green\n\n<$A> \n\nThe wall is green okay\n\n\nThe wall is green\n\n\nCould you explain\n\n<$J> \n\nSir the predicate <unclear> words <unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm so and why is it correct\n\n<$J> \n\nUhm <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nYes so you don't if I cross out \" green \" if you just look at the concept \" wall \" you would never have guessed that it 's green\n\n\nSo this is an expanding judgement\n\n\nYou add something new to your subject \" wall \" \n\n\nSo this is synthetic okay\n\n\nAnd if the concept of \" green \" is not derived only from the subject then where could we have gotten it\n\n\nFrom experience and so the source is  a posteriori  not  a priori , okay\n\n\nSo this an example of a synthetic judgement which is at the same time  a posteriori  \n\n\nOkay any questions\n\n\nNow let me uhm could you give me examples of synthetic  a priori   a posteriori  judgements\n\n\nThere should be many\n\n\nSynthetic  a posteriori  judgements\n\n<$K> \n\nSir the bag is full\n\n<$A> \n\nThe bag is full yes\n\n\nAnother\n\n\nYes\n\n<$L> \n\nThe car is red\n\n<$A> \n\nThe car is red\n\n\nFine\n\n\nAnother, \n\n\nYes\n\n<$M> \n\nThe room is big\n\n<$A> \n\nThe room is big\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nAlmost anything at at all that we talk about in everyday life I suppose is synthetic  a posteriori  judgement\n\n\nYour our examples are very very basic examples\n\n\nBut when you are for example talking about talking about somebody else if you know what I mean by that\n\n\nUhm you are murmuring something or well\n\n\nWhenever you are indulging in that you are uhm actually forming synthetic  a posteriori  judgements okay\n\n\nSo many judgements we do in ordinary life is synthetic  a posteriori  okay\n\n\nWhen we are trying to define a concept most likely we are doing analytic  a priori  judgement okay\n\n\nSo these two are not problematic and so Immanuel Kant would center would focus his attention on the third type of judgement namely synthetic  a priori  judgement\n\n\nSynthetic and so the predicate is not contained in the subject but  a priori  because the source of the expanding judgement the source of the new information is remarkably not experience but reason itself okay\n\n\nDo you see the difference\n\n\nI would not be surprised if the source is experience okay\n\n\nBut here the source is not experience the source is the mind itself\n\n\nHow is it that the mind is able from itself to give rise forth knowledge\n\n\nA knowledge which is not taken from the subject only but rather is, outside of it added to it\n\n\nExpanding making our knowledge grow and yet the source is the mind itself\n\n\nRemarkable okay\n\n\nBut according to Immanuel Kant there are lots of examples of synthetic  a priori  judgement and in fact no theoretical science is ever without it\n\n\nIf you care to open your text once again on page eight, \n\n\nRoman number five, \n\n\n In all theoretical sciences of reason synthetical judgements  a priori  are contained as principles  \n\n\nSo you cannot encounter any science any theoretical discipline which does not have anything to do with synthetic  a priori  judgement\n\n\nAnd so his examples are all from different disciplines\n\n\nSo the first one is from mathematics,  \n\n\nThe second one is from the natural sciences, \n\n\nAnd finally the third one is from metaphysics\n\n\nThe intent of Immanuel Kant is to exhaust all sciences beyond the mathematical sciences mathematical mathematics beyond the mathematical sciences the natural sciences and metaphysics what other science is there\n\n\nThis second one is supposed to include uh such disciplines as uh biology zoology astronomy physics all of them are incorporated in number letter B okay\n\n\nSo let 's start with uh mathematics\n\n\nHis example is\n\n\nOkay, explain what his example is\n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nAlright seven plus five is equal to twelve\n\n\nNow before we uhm we uhm judge the correctness of Immanuel Kant 's intention let 's first try to find out for ourselves whether this is really a synthetic  a priori  judgement\n\n\nFirst is this synthetic\n\n<$N> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy, \n\n\nWhy\n\n\nYes\n\n<$O> \n\nBecause the predicate is not contained in the subject\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause the predicate is not contained in the subject\n\n\nCould you tell me which is the subject\n\n<$O> \n\nSeven plus five\n\n<$A> \n\n\" Seven plus five \" is the subject and which is the predicate\n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nTwelve\n\n\n\" Twelve \" is not contained in the subject \" seven plus five \" \n\n\nWhat is contained in the subject\n\n\n\" Seven \" okay is contained in the subject \" plus \" is contained in the subject \" five \" is contained in the subject but not \" twelve \" \n\n\nSo that if I say \" seven plus five contains seven \" then that 's an analytic judgement\n\n\nIf I say \" seven plus five \" has \" plus \" that 's an analytic judgement\n\n\nIf I say \" seven plus five \" has \" five \" that 's an analytic judgement\n\n\nI just get it from the subject itself\n\n\nBut when I say \" seven plus five is equal to twelve \" according to Immanuel Kant I will need intuition\n\n\nI will need intuition for me to be able to know that seven plus five is equal to twelve\n\n\nWe are so used to seven plus five is equal to twelve that we don't think about it anymore\n\n\nBut take the first that the child who is learning this mathematical formula for the first time okay\n\n\nWhen presented with seven plus five is equal to question mark the child who is facing this problem for the first time would not have guessed that the answer is \" twelve \" \n\n\nI suppose he would use his fingers\n\n\nI suppose he would use sticks\n\n\nI suppose he would use dots or dashes okay and then afterwards he would count and counting them all he would arrive finally at the concept twelve okay\n\n\nSo \" twelve \" does not come from the subject itself\n\n\nIt is therefore synthetic judgement\n\n\nBut is it  a priori  or  a posteriori , \n\n\nYes Mister <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$P> \n\nSir uhm it is initially  a posteriori  \n\n<$A> \n\nIt is initially  a posteriori  \n\n\nVery good\n\n<$P> \n\nBut then time goes on it it becomes it later evolves into  a priori  \n\n<$A> \n\nAlright but later it evolves into  a priori  \n\n\nWhen was it when it was still  a posteriori  \n\n\nWhen I was counting with my fingers when I was using sticks or apples or pebbles in counting them\n\n\nBut later on when I don't use any more of these and I just say seven plus five is equal to twelve this is already  a priori  judgement, okay\n\n\nSo all knowledge begins with experience but it does not necessarily follow that it arises from experience\n\n\nInitially in the beginning I need experience but look at the power of our mind sooner or later we we draw from all that we experience and we generalize we universalize, we make our judgement necessary every time that you have seven added to five you will always have twelve\n\n\nNecessity and universality and therefore you have an  a priori  and no longer an  a posteriori  judgement okay\n\n\nSo far so good, \n\n\nNow can we now move on to the natural sciences, \n\n\nCan you give me the first example of Kant, \n\n\nWhat is Kant 's first example, \n\n\nYes  \n\n\nYes but how is it uh expressed in our text, \n\n\nHave you found it\n\n\nYes\n\n<$Q> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nDo you see that class, okay\n\n\n In all changes of the material world the quantity of matter always remains unchanged  \n\n\nOr in other words the more popular version of it is\n\n\nCould you repeat that\n\n<$Q> \n \n\n<$A> \n\n Matter can neither be created nor destroyed  \n\n\nOkay class that 's our first example\n\n\n Matter can neither be, created nor destroyed , \n\n\nLet us test this judgement\n\n\nFirst is it synthetic or analytic, \n\n\nWhy synthetic <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nProve it prove it\n\n\nIs it synthetic or analytic yes\n\n<$?> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nAlright fine so if you remove the predicate what is your  what is your subject anyway\n\n\nYour subject is \" matter \" \n\n\nDoes the idea of \" matter \" tell you immediately that it can neither be created nor destroyed\n\n\nNo it cannot reveal to you the predicate the subject does not reveal to you the predicate and so the predicate you must have taken from elsewhere not from the subject\n\n\nOkay so it is not analytic\n\n\nIt is synthetic\n\n\nVery good", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2c72807a-376d-49f2-874c-863d632e1b82", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.060228+00:00"}

uh uh the second part which is the field as it is uh uh found in the Philippines you know\n\n\nWhat what I can now share with you some of the uh literature in the Philippines okay\n\n\nUh, I have been away from the field for some time now uh as you grow older and you have many other duties you find that much as you would like to pursue interesting places for research you can no longer do it\n\n\nThis is one of the most painful things for me in terms of uh leading the life of a scholar I 'm doing a lot of administrative work\n\n\nI 'm one of the few administrators I think in the world that has tried to keep up intellectually with his field of research while doing a lot of administrative work\n\n\nWell I find that I 'm happy to be <unclear> words </unclear> in the area now which is the area of sociolinguistics specifically I 've been doing a lot of work on national uh language development\n\n\nI suppose if you ask me who 's the most knowledgeable person in national language development probably I would say it 's between Dr Sibayan and myself\n\n\nHe is a dear friend he 's eighty-two and I 'm fifty-seven so I hope that Tish would be our successor  \n\n\nHey we 're all getting old uh but this is part of the uh again the culture of rise and fall of the human beings and their self-actualization because I find the topic of child language fascinating\n\n\nI like children although when they grow up they turn out to be horrible  in the sense that they don't follow anymore what you tell them to do and they keep making mistakes\n\n\nIt seems the present generation needs to make mistakes before you can really do before they learn and I 'm hoping that in their middle age they would pick up wisdom\n\n\nBut uh it 's a fascinating field uh I guess if I if I weren't an administrator I would certainly devote half my time to child language uh research because I find it fascinating\n\n\nUh plus the psychic reward of being with children is something since I 'm celibate I don't have any children\n\n\nThey 're very nice until about <unclear> words </unclear>  they 're about school age and then they become colossal pains in the ass then you you appreciate what it is to be a celibate\n\n\nBut that 's neither here nor there  \n\n\nBut anyway uh uh but I cannot now\n\n\nI 've been trying to get people involved in child language because this field is wide open\n\n\nYou can do it\n\n\nAll you need is time and intelligence it doesn't need expensive equipment\n\n\nAnd yet really I 've had no takers\n\n\nThe ones I tried to train in the beginning have not continued in child language\n\n\nThey 've gone on into other fields\n\n\nAnd but in the States and in Europe especially in the States it 's fantastic\n\n\nThe field is only about thirty years old\n\n\nReally serious research on child language began in the early sixties\n\n\nAnd now it 's thirty thirty-seven years\n\n\nThe literature is vast\n\n\nUh there is a quarterly journal on which I 'm on the editorial board\n\n\nYou can find this in the linguistics library uh of a bibliography of uh applied linguistics\n\n\nUh it 's a and if you want to see the entries the last three months or the last six months on child language acquisition language acquisition in general you find piles and piles of entries on the thing because there 's a tremendous amount of research going on\n\n\nAnd what I don't I guess here in the Philippines the biggest drawback to research is the fact that people don't really have time\n\n\n if you have if you 're in any way halfway talented you are asked to do ten thousand other things\n\n\nThen you end up uh not really <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nIf nobody asks you to do anything consider that a form of an insult because it means you 're not talented for anything  \n\n\nUh but the moment you show any kind of talent in a school or institution they keep   piling you with work  \n\n<$B> \n\n I know that   \n\n<$A> \n\nSo anyway uh so the long and short of it is uh, I 've been trying to train people for child language studies and uh I 've not succeeded\n\n\nThere is nobody right now on this campus for example who is seriously pursuing child language studies\n\n\nI wish I could get somebody I 'll hire that person on the spot uh to  because to create a good department you need subspecializations in the department\n\n\nSo you know this person will handle literature the literature of a special kind this person will handle child language this person will be your psycholinguist this person will be your sociolinguist\n\n\nThat 's how you build excellence in your department\n\n\nUh you cannot build that uh you know the way things are going\n\n\nUnless you have this vision beforehand\n\n\nSo the the field developed around late fifties early sixties and the pioneer was a Harvard uh psychologist by the name of Brown Roger Brown and he gathered with him a group of disciples the most outstanding of which was a woman by the name of Ursula Bellugi who subsequently moved with her husband to Santa Barbara and there continued their work there although I presume she must be close to retirement by now alright\n\n\nUh side by side with Brown and a contemporary a very old man now is a marvelous universal linguist by the name of Charles Ferguson who is now at Stanford but he 's officially retired as far as I know\n\n\nAnd he had a disciple by the name of Catherine Snow who did a lot of work\n\n\nAnd then I studied under a second generation person by the name of Dan Slobin who is at Berkeley and a very fine man\n\n\nAnd then later on there was a whole spate of disciples after that\n\n\nThe most productive of whom at one time was a pair called uh Heidi Dulay a Filipina but you know  naturalized American citizen and then a woman by the name of Marina Burt\n\n\nThey did some pioneering studies in child language studies in the States\n\n\nAnd now it 's impossible there are so many specialists all over the place but\n\n\nThese are the pioneers you 'll find all their books in my library\n\n\nActually if you 're interested in this field almost every issue of \" Language \" which is the official journal of the Linguistic Society of America has a very good one or two very good articles on child language either a regular article or what you call a review article\n\n\nSo you can pretty much gauge what is happening in the field and you 're very welcome to look at that if this is the kind of thing that uh turns you on\n\n\nAnd if you 're a linguist and you have your own child uh or co-produce a baby\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm  \n\n<$A> \n\nTo study uh to study your child\n\n\nAnd some have done that but I have to see the results\n\n\nYou know yeah I just have to <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nBrother what 's the bibliography you mentioned that 's in your linguistics library the index of applied linguists I mean\n\n<$A> \n\n\" Bibliography of Applied Linguistics \" you can ask my secretary in fact I 'm looking at it right now\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nNow therefore it 's become a subspecialty in psycholinguistics and in general for language theory because I would like to show part of the reason people get interested in studying how language emerge emerges in the human species is a fact that this has serious implications for language theory and for the uh what Chomsky calls \" the theory of mind \" \n\n\nIn other words the brain, \n\n\nAnd if you look at the field the way it has developed there are different kinds of studies\n\n\nYou can study what we call cross-sectional you get children more or less of the same age and you study uh what they have in common what they have that 's different\n\n\nYou can do longitudinal studies and these are mostly case studies you study two people one or two people and see how they evolve from the time they 're merely producing babble like uh infants you know to the time they start talking which is roughly about twelve months to the time they start using sentences which is roughly uh eighteen months\n\n\nAnd the first full sentences grammatically correct uh are about twenty-four months\n\n\nSo that by thirty-six months the child becomes fluent in the native language\n\n\nThis is the normal schedule of human beings but there are individual differences of course\n\n\nUh then there are case studies of individuals uh especially bilinguals multilinguals children who grow up speaking more than one language which most of us belong to that category\n\n\nWe grow up in the Philippines bilinguals uh we normally speak the home language and then we speak Filipino or Tagalog\n\n\nAnd then if you come from an affluent home you begin with English even as a baby depending on the uh on how often your parents talk to you in that language\n\n\nAnd depending also on the  yaya  the child has alright\n\n\nUh then you have uh ethnographic descriptions you know of how language language is used in a community which could be a modern or an ethnic community up in the mountains you know like the Kalinga-Apayaos and some of the non-low land people who still pretty much live a restricted life\n\n\nAlright so uhm now uh depending on the uh uh growth of the discipline and the number of people working in it uh the there is a historian of science whom I who died only about two or three years ago who wrote one of the minor classics of the twentieth century by the name of Thomas Kuhn\n\n\nYou 'll find the book it 's called \" The Structure of Scientific Revolutions \" \n\n\nAnd uh of course not everybody accepts what he says now\n\n\nBut I think basically the outline is still good he says in all the sciences there is what we call a prevailing paradigm where everybody who does that science is expected to follow that paradigm or model of doing things \n\n\nNow what happens then is after a while that paradigm shifts\n\n\nYou change the model completely but as long as the model is there it 's pretty much assumed by all the practitioners that that 's the way we do psychology that 's the way we do guidance and counseling and there are paradigms you know that 's the way we do things in physics that 's the way we do things in chemistry and so on and so forth\n\n\nThe way we do things in child language studies is we make certain assumptions which I call the frame of reference because I don't want to call it a paradigm P A R A D I G M because some people don't feel comfortable with that uh with that term they get confused they get threatened\n\n\nA word that is easier is \" model \" a mental model of something or if you want something neutral say so you don't get upset uh \" frame of reference \", \n\n\nWhen people 's\n\n\nWe have a frame of reference for everything, \n\n\nThat 's one thing modern psychology and modern cognitive psychology especially has shown us it has tremendous repercussions in philosophy especially what we call \" epistemology \" or \" the theory of knowledge \" \n\n\nI don't know if any of you took up epistemology in college\n\n\nWell if you went to Santo Tomas I 'm sure you did  okay\n\n\nAnd uh the epistemology they teach you at Santo Tomas uh epistemology they teach you in seminaries the epistemology they teach you in about ninety percent of uh  Catholic colleges or colleges taught by former seminarians is really out of it\n\n\nIn other words the paradigm is about one thousand years old and it 's really pass\u00e9 but when I was taking epistemology I had to study that when I was I took up epistemology about nineteen fifty-seven nineteen fifty-eight okay\n\n\nUh  there are modern theories we now know more about the theory of knowing that 's what epistemology is\n\n\nHow people learn things how people think, how people perceive\n\n\nVery often what you see is not what is there outside but what you expect to see, \n\n\nAnd when it comes to approaching reality, there is really very little that can be called objective\n\n\nYou approach reality uh with the uh the paradigms of your uh discipline, \n\n\nAnd you have a mental model of everything that you do\n\n\nUh whether in the field of morality in the field of literature in the field of ethics in the field of human relations in how you treat human beings and so forth and so on everything\n\n\nWe are inter-subjective people\n\n\nWe 're not really objective people, \n\n\nAnd the thing is unless you obtain a liberal education, and you become aware that you think this way because you are what you are because of your history then you think that your point of view is the only point of view that 's valid\n\n\nAnd you become very narrow-minded, \n\n\nBut on the other hand you have the other extreme if you have no center of your own you have no shared convictions then you 're the victim of whoever talks to you last\n\n\nI have met individuals like that\n\n\nThey tell you whatever they heard last\n\n\nThere is no center\n\n\nPart of education is you form your own center and then you judge future encounters against your own center and while your center can continue to evolve it doesn't mean that you pick up every single new idea that comes into the scene uh as if you are a  tabula rasa  \n\n\nNobody 's a  tabula rasa  \n\n\nYou sort of uh eventually uh form your own convictions", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n\nSo may I just ask from from you in a one-fourth sheet of paper your comments about what just transpired <unclear> words </unclear> because it will help the department head who was here a while ago\n\n\nIf you know her department head of management to uh, determine whether it will consider taking in <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nYou can comment or discuss the topic \" entrepreneurship \" even though we are not really an entrepreneurial group or belonging to a class taking up entrepreneurship it would be better really to find out what entrepreneurship is all about  'no  'cause many a time students take up courses to really train themselves to become employees and as we mentioned last time employment is very much different from self-employment okay\n\n\nSo if you were to define \" entrepreneurship \" you will say something like uh it is the ability  'no  of a person to perceive the products or services needed and or wanted by a segment of society and to deliver these needed products and services the right kind of products and services if we may just uh emphasize it  'no  to the right kind of buyers because it 's possible that you may be catering to the wrong customer at the right time and place and of course at the right price and terms of payment\n\n\nYou will notice there are a lot of adjectives uh nouns preceded by the word \" right \"  'no  \n\n\nThe right products or services the right customers the right time and place the right price and terms of payment, and the ability to be able to perceive and effect such a transaction is something that an entrepreneur should be able to have okay\n\n\nActually society or a nation develops only to the extent that we have a lot of these entrepreneurs around\n\n\nSo if you can say that society 's development is really a function of the presence of entrepreneurs\n\n\nIf we have more of these people okay the right kind of course 'cause there are entrepreneurs who are unscrupulous okay\n\n\nThey follow certain bad practices in business\n\n\nSo we are referring more on the right kind the right kind of entrepreneurs  'no  \n\n\nIf we have more of them then it is safe to assume that development of a certain nation or society will really be seen okay\n\n\nSo how fast a nation develops is also dependent on the number and kind of entrepreneurs that we have\n\n\nOkay suppose we have a lot of entrepreneurs in a given country like the Philippines\n\n\nSuppose we can say we are an entrepreneurial society what will be some benefits of having this kind of a set-up where more and more of the individuals are turning to become self-employed individuals rather than being employees\n\n\nWhat will be the benefits\n\n\nNow there are about five of them some of which you already know some of which are rather obvious but maybe some of which you still are not aware of\n\n\nOne is that entrepreneurial society will experience a generation of opportunities for employment  'no  \n\n\nWe will have more and more opportunities for employment okay because the entrepreneur is the one who creates jobs okay not the employee\n\n\nSo if we have more people getting to be employed what normally will be the consequence\n\n\nFor one thing we will have uh an increase in productivity okay because if people have more money to spend then they will be in a position to buy products and services okay and if products and services are being patronized being bought by more and more people then firms plants okay factories will be encouraged to become more productive okay\n\n\nSo it 's uh it 's a chain effect  'no  \n\n\nSo productivity is essentially a function of the presence of employment among the people\n\n\nSecond benefit here is that entrepreneurship improves the quality of life of the people\n\n\nNow why do we say quality of life or the living standards of people\n\n\nWell for one thing entrepreneurs are supposed to be noted for innovation or for that innovative spirit  'no  now they keep on looking for new and better ways of improving our way of living\n\n\nExample may be in the realm of the home okay\n\n\n Yung mga nagluluto diyan naglalaba diyan  \n\n\n Sa  cooking before  hindi kilala yung mga  microwave and all that  'no  but now it 's already an in thing okay\n\n\nBefore we didn't know about this washing machine and so forth but now it 's very much an in thing among families even even maybe those belonging to the C level okay\n\n\nEven in agriculture our farmers before didn't know about certain implements or ways of plowing the field without so much you know hard hard uh hard work and effort and so forth but now they are aware of certain machinery okay\n\n\nEven in telecommunications  dati wala yung  fax\n\n\nBut now  'yong  fax is maybe an ordinary thing to many of us okay\n\n\nEven in computers\n\n\n Dati walang  computers  pero ngayon  we are developing more and more of this in different sizes shapes and so forth\n\n\nSo the quality of life is definitely being improved  'no  \n\n\nEven among uh mothers  'no  they care for babies\n\n\nBefore  hindi kilala yung mga  different types of uh what 's this plastic panties and so forth\n\n\nBut now  ang dali-dali nang bumili no'n  therefore overnight you don't have to bother yourselves waking up and you know changing the baby 's clothes and so forth whenever they wet the bed and so forth\n\n\nBut right now you can you know have a good night 's sleep without being bothered by this  kasi merong  plastic panty and also the bottle feeding bottle  meron na ngayon nilalagay doon sa  bottle  na  plastic  'no  \n\n\nYou don't have to be sterilizing the bottle now okay\n\n\nI know that because we still use that at home okay\n\n\nNow the third one\n\n\nA third benefit here is that entrepreneurship contributes to more equitable distribution of income\n\n\nWhat do we mean by \" equitable \" \n\n\nBecause as you probably know in our society it is something like a pyramid where the tip essentially about ten to thirty percent consisting of upper A or the A class  'no  while the rest about seventy to eighty percent consisting of the masses okay\n\n\n Kaya sinasabing  equitable distribution of income\n\n\nAt the moment maybe wealth is concentrated right there the tip  'no  \n\n\nAbout ten to thirty percent at the maximum while the rest are probably living below the poverty line okay\n\n\nIf we have an entrepreneurial society and more and more people having jobs more and more people having sources of income then wealth of a nation can be distributed more proportionately more equally okay because uh if there is inequity in society we normally would expect something like dissension coming from the masses the people who are supposed to be deprived of certain wealth\n\n\nNow what could be some examples of wealth aside from money of course\n\n\nWe have a most important wealth  'no  land\n\n\nThat is why in our government the centerpiece of the Aquino government is actually reflected in that law which is the CARP Comprehensive Agricultural Reform Program or Law CARL okay\n\n\nThat is why the present government also has this bill actually already enacted into law so that there could be equal distribution of wealth  ano'ng ibig sabihin noon  \n\n\nIf we have this implemented the  Kalakalan  Twenty which is a countryside development program where industries are dispersed in the rural areas  'no  so that more and more of development can take place in the rural areas then the people who are residing in such rural areas will be somehow encouraged to stay there and not migrate to the urban centers like Manila \n\n\nAnd as you know when they migrate to the metropolis what normally happens we have congestion we have traffic we have squatters and normally we have a rise in crime wave okay\n\n\nSo entrepreneurship somehow contributes to an equitable distribution of wealth and because that happens poverty somehow is reduced\n\n\nWe cannot really eliminate this  'no  \n\n\nIf you say you want to eliminate poverty that may be a tall order that may be utopian  'no  it 's something ideal what we would like to have is a reduction in the incidence of poverty\n\n\nOkay the fourth one is the utilization and mobilization of resources for great national productivity\n\n\nNow what are resources\n\n\nResources would involve many things  'no  like our natural resources\n\n\nThat is why we would like to encourage more and more of our entrepreneurs  'no  not only to be extracting the products from mother nature and exporting them right away  'no  all with the end in view of generating dollars\n\n\nThat is something good but sometimes we go to the extent of going beyond what is necessary and in fact what is what is more important as we mentioned last time  'no  is to generate some kind of value added to our uh extractive industries\n\n\nWhat do we mean by that\n\n\nSo the logs that we get hopefully we can add some value by using these raw materials and coming out with products like furniture tables and chairs and so forth that our own people will be producing\n\n\nAnd if we do that then there is the value added component okay\n\n\nSo instead of just exporting the logs in their raw form we can use the raw materials and come out with a more concrete product okay\n\n\nSo we not only generate employment but it is possible that we can also save on dollars the very thing that we would like to get when we export products\n\n\nWhy do we save on dollars\n\n\nBecause maybe some of the furniture and fixtures will <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nSo the fifth benefit  'no  is entrepreneurship brings social benefits\n\n\nThese social benefits are made possible by our government\n\n\nNow what are these social benefits\n\n\nThey come in the form of infrastructure okay roads buildings dams and so forth\n\n\nAs well as certain basic social services like the collection of our garbage okay drainage system the maintenance of peace and order the presence of our law enforcers \n\n\nAnd all that will be made possible if we have more and more businesses being set up and from which taxes will be paid to the government okay\n\n\nSo the government can only produce such uh, activities which are supposed to be of social benefits to us  'no  if they have revenues and these revenues come in the form of taxes coming from the businessmen the entrepreneurs okay\n\n\nSo these are the five particular benefits that we can derive if we have an entrepreneurial society\n\n\nNow what 's the next here\n\n\nSo we already know what 's an entrepreneur but are there certain types of entrepreneurs\n\n\nBasically it 's just two\n\n\nThe really pure one and for lack of any term or phrase the not-so-pure-one okay\n\n\nWhat do we mean by the \" pure entrepreneur \" \n\n\nThe pure entrepreneur is someone who is able to create the idea create the business, set up the business whether it 's a sole proprietorship or maybe a partnership or later on a corporation and then nurse the business to a certain degree of health okay\n\n\nThat 's the pure entrepreneur\n\n\nSo someone like Leonardo Sarao with his jeepney like Socorro Ramos with her National Bookstore with Narda Capuyan with their  ikat  okay\n\n\nAnd many more even like Mr Henry Ford with his model T Mr Rockefeller with uh his oil refinery business okay\n\n\nHowever there are urban entrepreneurs whom we cannot really consider as pure in the sense that they did not start the whole thing from the very start\n\n\nThey probably just inherited the business\n\n\nSo let 's say your grandfather dies leaves you a million or a billion pesos or maybe leaves you a business to manage that may be the second type or maybe you just bought a business the so called franchising\n\n\nSo  yung mga  Jollibee McDonald Wendy 's and so forth they are also in franchising so you put up a store bearing the same name\n\n\nYou run the business the way the mother company runs it that is franchising okay\n\n\n Hindi ikaw ang nagsimula nun pero dahil hindi  at least you didn't start it\n\n\nYou got it from someone else\n\n\nIn fact you just pay royalty to the mother unit to the mother company okay\n\n\nSo these are types of entrepreneurs\n\n\nNow why do you think individuals become entrepreneurs\n\n\nSome of them start out as employees okay\n\n\nSo he works for a certain company for five ten fifteen twenty years like probably many of you will and then later on decides that he will have a shift in his career from employee to self-employed\n\n\nWhy do they become like that\n\n\nThere are essentially certain reasons for going into entrepreneurship and I 'll cite to you about four\n\n\nOne is, after let 's say devoting ten to twenty years of your productive life let 's say you graduate twenty by the time you reach forty or about middle mid-life  'no  sometimes you experience some boredom monotony or in psychology something what you called \" burn-out \" \n\n\nWhat do you mean by \" burn-out \" \n\n\n Kumbaga sa kandila nauupos ka na  \n\n\nYou 've almost given-up everything in terms of your productive years and now  parang wala na wala ka nang ibubuga  okay so burn-out\n\n\nAnother is you have reached your peak  'no  and therefore you are experiencing plateauing you know what 's a plateau  'no  plateau  parang lumakad ganon na  it 's all throughout like that\n\n\nSo there is no marked increase or significant change for the better as far as you 're concerned and there 's a tendency that you will decline just like any product just like any company\n\n\nAfter maturity you may have the tendency to decline to be phased out okay", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThis month is Holy Week then after Holy Week is already uh unholy week  \n\n\nI mean review week\n\n\nThen after the review week you have the finals  'no  \n\n\nDo not forget the requirements that I 've asked you to do specifically the one on the drama  'no  <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nThen I gave you already last time the matters for the paper\n\n\nDo not forget those because you may run out of time, <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nWe go on and uh continue our discussion of the nature of poetry\n\n\nWe started on this last time\n\n\nWe have already some ideas as to why we said uh poetry in our present society seems to be not as popular as it used to be in the earlier period\n\n\nAnd we said that in general what was the main reason for this\n\n\nDo you remember what we said about this uh last time Miguel\n\n\nWhat would be in general the primary reason why we have this particular attitude of disinclination for poetry and uh why poetry is unpopular\n\n<$B> \n\nSir poverty\n\n<$A> \n\nYou explain\n\n<$B> \n\nSir since uh before uh <unclear> words </unclear> poetry is very popular at that time but but uh after we we our our economy became unstable uhm poetry became, became <unclear> words </unclear>  biglang nawala Sir kasi  it 's very impractical now to to to\n\n<$A> \n\nSo why is it now let us say quite impractical as you 're saying when we try to pursue the matter of poetry\n\n\nWhat makes it impractical\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause uh we only uh we have to we only think of our survival we we don't have time for leisure\n\n<$A> \n\nRight so probably the idea of leisure time is no longer no longer available for us since uh as we said our poverty dramatically demands that we pay more attention to some other basic needs\n\n\nOf course we are generalizing on that  'no  \n\n\nThe uh the rich society or the rich members of society in our society have all the leisure time and have all the money to pursue artistic activities but we are talking about the ordinary common people which would form the majority of our society\n\n\nSo what does that illustrate there Miguel\n\n\nIt illustrates that art and literature to be popular must really address a segment of society that is ready for them\n\n\nAnd how how will we be how will we be ready for such kind of art and poetry\n\n\nWhen will we be ready in, for such things\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe uhm when our economy is stable\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah economy will be stable\n\n<$B> \n\nMost of our people will be above average\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay and have better economic situation\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause it 's very obvious\n\n\nYou want to learn you want to appreciate art\n\n\nYou have no money\n\n\nHow can you how can you get the means by which to appreciate art\n\n\nPoetry what what do you need\n\n\nTo read the books where the poems are supposed to be found\n\n\nOr to listen to poets read their poems\n\n\nOr to have discussions of poetry\n\n\nBut if you have no time and money you will exclude yourself from such kind of activities\n\n\nIt seems these we said uh were activities that refer to the spiritual intellectual development of man\n\n\nIn a poor society you have to attend first to the development of your body before you can attend to your mind\n\n\nI think that 's very obvious\n\n\nIf you if you make a study of the third world countries in this uh in this world you will find that they have all of these countries have really much the same situation as we have in terms of the popularity of the arts\n\n\nThat 's the tragedy of a poor country this country\n\n\nThe poor the poor people cannot really even if they want to attend to the necessities of the mind because they are still attending to the necessities of the stomach\n\n\nNo matter how you may like to improve your intelligence your artistic uh sensibility if you are poor you have already a lot of obstacles  no  in front of you before you can improve yourself\n\n\nThat 's why if you notice in our society you people you belong to the better-off segment of society the more fortunate\n\n\nCompare yourselves to people of your same age who are poor\n\n\nYou have all the advantages, \n\n\nThere 's this guy from uh  promdi  as we say\n\n\nHe 's poor he wants to study but he has no money\n\n\nWhere can he go\n\n\nHe can't go to La Salle where presumably there 's quality education\n\n\nSo where does he end up\n\n\nHe end up he ends up in one of those corner uh universities in Manila where the educational facilities and instruction are not quite at par with the ones we have in La Salle or Ateneo or some other private schools\n\n\nHe has already a disadvantage\n\n\n Talo na agad siya 'no  \n\n\nNot only that he has no money\n\n\nHe cannot buy all the books that you can read and increase your grade\n\n\nAnd when he graduates he graduates with a kind of lesser lesser intellectual development than you do because in La Salle you have all the facilities\n\n\nYou have all the good teachers of uh literature  but those other people you observe you go to\n\n\nI was in P U P last Saturday I gave a lecture on literature and they have a different culture over there\n\n\nThey don't talk about literature as we talk in class\n\n\nThey still talk of literature as if it were part of the struggle to liberate the society from the oppressions of this and that society\n\n\nIn short the way you tend to look at literature will also affect your appreciation and your understanding of it\n\n\nAnd as I was saying since literature pertains to the mind really in terms of effects it 's an intellectual activity\n\n\nIf I 'm not concerned with my intelligence because I 'm more concerned with my body I 'm at a disadvantage in terms of effects\n\n\nWe do not realize that  'no  \n\n\nYou people who are in that kind of advantage but you should because you have all the facilities the means by which you can improve your mind at the same time that you 're planning to improve your body\n\n\nThen when you graduate you have your degree and that guy has a degree from P U P\n\n\nWho gives a damn about a college degree from P U P\n\n\nIf you apply in Makati for a job will they say uh P U P this is what this is the guy we get no\n\n\nYou have all the advantage\n\n\nYour parents are already there in the institutions you want to apply at\n\n\nProbably your parents own the institution so at once you are vice-president\n\n\nThis poor guy this poor uh uh wretched fellow from P U P starts as a janitor\n\n\nSo  wala na  \n\n\n Hindi siya makakahabol sa inyo  \n\n\nThat 's what I 'm meaning\n\n\nBecause of that disparity in your social situations\n\n\nThat 's how it is in the poor countries\n\n\n'Cause you know from your studies, ninety percent of the of the economy of this country is in the hands of a very few\n\n\nThey 're the ones dictating the trends and the developments in our society\n\n\nIf you don't belong to that ninety percent whether by birth or by employment you lose a lot in terms of advancement, \n\n\nSo what are all of these things anyway insofar as poetry is concerned\n\n\nCan poetry help you any better when you graduate from La Salle\n\n\nWill poetry a knowledge of poetry be an advantage to you when you apply for a job in a bank\n\n\nWill the bank manager when he is processing your application paper tell you could you recite to me this or that poem so I 'll know if I get you  \n\n\nOf course not\n\n\n Di ba  \n\n\n Di naman itatanong 'yon  \n\n\n Marunong ka bang mag-  determine  ng  metaphor or simile\n\n\nThose things will not help\n\n\nIn short again poetry is useless for such practical purposes\n\n\nAlright it 's useless\n\n\nYou can live and die without having read a book of poetry and God will not take that against you\n\n\nIt will neither lessen nor add to your being a human being in the sense of practicality right\n\n\nIt has no functional value in short unlike engineering\n\n\nWhen you take up civil engineering or chemical engineering\n\n\nUndoubtedly that 's why you 're taking them up you will be very much using them when you graduate\n\n\nIn poetry no\n\n\nWhy are we taking up poetry\n\n\nWhy read poetry at all\n\n\nIsn't that isn't that quite uh strange\n\n\nWhy not just let the situation be\n\n\nDon't read poetry anyway it 's not useful for us\n\n\nWhy all of this talk about relating it to your life and so on\n\n\nWhy is it part of your curriculum in this university anyway you won't be using it at all after you graduate\n\n\nIts use of course will not be in the practical sense\n\n\nIts use will be something else\n\n\nIts use will be a personal use for you\n\n\nAnd that 's very hard to see if you 're not used to that kind of uh thinking you 're not used to that kind of attitude towards art\n\n\nWhy do you see a movie for instance\n\n\nWhy do you listen to a piece of music\n\n\nIs it the same as when you read a piece of poetry\n\n\nYou don't think of any practical, advantage at once or any practical result when you listen to a piece of music do you\n\n\nBut why do you listen to your favorite musician the great masterpieces of your favorite singers Andrew E for instance  \n\n\nWhat do you get what do you get out of that uh Irwin\n\n\nWhy do you listen to music in general for instance, \n\n\n Ha  Irwin, do you listen to music\n\n\n Ha  Irwin\n\n\n Si  Irwin yes\n\n<$?> \n Irvin\n\n<$A> \n\nIrvin  uh oo nga 'no  \n\n\nIrvin you listen to Chinese music\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nSo why do you listen to Chinese music\n\n\nWhat do you get out of it  \n\n\nOh explain what do I what do you mean by entertainment\n\n<$C> \n\nSo you can relax\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay yeah that 's a good word\n\n\nRelax\n\n\n Hindi ba gaya nga ng sabi sa  Mass, peace\n\n\nYou want inner peace there are only two ways you know\n\n\nGo to God or go to art you see\n\n\nBoth can give you peace\n\n\nSometimes God is very busy for mere mortals like Irvin Lim\n\n\nWho 's Irvin Lim anyway  \n\n\nSo many billions of people in this world and there are more important people than  Irvin Lim\n\n\nSo don't go to God you probably can go to art Chinese music Japanese music Filipino music modern classical whatever\n\n\nBecause you want to relax and I imagine what you can relax with Irvin is that kind of uh comfort that kind of peace isn't it\n\n\n Kasi  very often you listen to music when you want to forget your problems problems of your stomach the problems of your practical everyday life isn't it\n\n\nYou notice that you go to something not practical\n\n\nYou can easily go to McDonald and eat  yourself away but that will not give you peace isn't it\n\n\nIt will give you indigestion  \n\n\nThat 's not peace even if that 's the most practical thing you should do to solve your problem\n\n\nYou go to something spiritual you see and that 's it\n\n\nAnd that 's personal you cannot say since I I enjoy this piece of music you should also enjoy it\n\n\nNo because there will be quite a lot of differences between you and the other guy\n\n\nI do not say that you may not get the same effect\n\n\nBut the degree will be different\n\n\nThat 's why you have favorite musicians favorite pieces favorite writers if ever you read literature and so on  di ba  \n\n\nThey are your personal link to some kind of inner peace that you would like to get\n\n\nThe same with poetry you know\n\n\nIf we look at poetry as a means by which such kind of relaxation can also be achieved then probably we will have some kind of change of attitude towards it\n\n\nWe won't dislike it right at the very start\n\n\nYou go to poetry like you go to music\n\n\nIt will have no practical value to you first but it will have personal value\n\n\nFor instance the first time you see this kind of idea in this poem an idea you never touched on in engineering or chemistry or whatever\n\n\n Ngayon nakita mo rito  and then you realize that is true\n\n\n Yon lang  realization of the meaning of that idea is already a joy isn't it\n\n\n'Cause knowledge is joy\n\n\nKnowledge is power\n\n\nOr you just listen to the sound of the words together\n\n\n Magandang pakinggan  \n\n\nThe rhythm or the rhyme even if you don't understand the whole poem but there may be certain parts that appeal to your sense of hearing\n\n\n 'Yan  that 's already a form of enjoyment\n\n\nOr because of the poem you 're able to imagine certain things\n\n\nThat 's it the joy of imagining what before you had not thought you could imagine that is also enjoyment\n\n\nSo those small areas those small effects of the poem may contribute to some kind of changes inside you a change that or changes that are really as I would say more personal than anything else\n\n\nWhat we do in a class like this in poetry is try to formalize only is try to substantiate all of those things that you can possibly get from reading poetry so that in a way we can all see at the same time something that can be seen\n\n\nBut I repeat it is a highly personal activity\n\n\nSince we 're in a classroom we could try to see whether this is possible on a larger class scale, \n\n\nAs in our definition last time you remember our definition of our working definition of poetry\n\n\nCould you repeat that Manuel\n\n\nWhat what what did we say was the working definition of poetry\n\n<$D> \n\nPoetry is a kind of language that expresses more than prose <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay expresses or says  'no  more than prose,  \n\n\nAlright poetry is a kind of language that says more or expresses more than prose and says more says it more I 'm sorry intensely than prose\n\n\nSo we have two two aspects of the definition\n\n\nAnd that is what we have just tried to illustrate  'no  \n\n\nThis area of intensity and quantity\n\n\nIt 's quantity, \n\n\nThis one is quality  'no  intense", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6178fbc9-9486-4856-945e-233260138d9c", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nOkay in action research that means that Lewin was interested in transforming a life problem okay a real life problem into, into controlled research\n\n\nAnd so he would observe something that 's wrong with the environment with the society okay and try to research that, okay using a carefully controlled study\n\n\nAnd always it 's a controlled research and always using a theoretical framework\n\n\nHe never did research without first having a theoretical framework okay which is how research should be, done as you all know, okay\n\n\nSo he first observed something that 's wrong with the society came out with a theory that would explain that and then tested that theory\n\n\nOkay for example one of his important researches is that of group decision making, \n\n\nOkay a firm it started with a firm hiring him to look at the low productivity of the firm, they are a factory\n\n\nThe factory had very poor productivity very low productivity\n\n\nSo Lewin went to the environment observed what was wrong\n\n\nOkay and he found that the workers were not motivated to produce, \n\n\nThe workers had long hours\n\n\nThey had a quota for the factory they had to fulfill a quota per day\n\n\nAnd so the first thing he found out was that the work was simply too much for the workers okay\n\n\nAnd the workers had no say okay about what they should be doing at work\n\n\nOkay so what he did, made his theory was that if you allow the workers to make their own decisions regarding their work okay then they would produce more, \n\n\nOkay in your thesis if we allowed you to do a topic of your choice then that would make you work more  di ba  than if we assigned you your own topic\n\n\nOkay so what he did was he grouped the workers into smaller groups asked them to come up with what they thought was a reasonable quota reasonable working hours\n\n\nThat was presented to management\n\n\nOkay they tried it out and they found out as a result of that group decision making productivity indeed went up\n\n\nThey 're very practical very approachable, \n\n\nOkay another relevant research especially at that time the nineteen forties in the U S racial discrimination, \n\n\nIt was still a very big major problem, and one of the problems was that the blacks of course at that time were already free so they had problems integrating into white communities okay because of discrimination, \n\n\nHis theory about that is that discrimination exists because of segregation because the blacks lived in one community and the whites lived in another community\n\n\nIf we allowed them to mingle okay if we mixed them okay then discrimination their attitudes discriminative attitudes would decrease\n\n\nOkay so  'yong  research  niya  quasi-experimental\n\n\nOkay in one housing settlement, in one housing settlement where there were several apartment buildings in alternating apartment buildings are black and white families okay\n\n\nSo in one building it 's purely black families in another building purely white okay\n\n\nIn a way it 's mixed but still segregated 'cause they 're still in separate buildings\n\n\nCompared to another housing facility okay wherein in all buildings the families are mixed black and white\n\n\nOkay where would you think discrimination is more likely to exist bad attitudes  \n\n\nIn here why, \n\n\n Kunyari  you went camping with Ateneans okay and we put you in separate tents okay compared to in this type wherein you 're together in the same tent\n\n\nWhere would negative feelings more likely be encouraged  \n\n\nWhen you 're in separate tents\n\n\nAnd the same was found in this research\n\n\nWhen they were in separate buildings discrimination was more pronounced, \n\n\nDiscrimination was also found, in stores, in department stores wherein there were black personnel\n\n\nAnd white clients were complaining, okay about black salespersons, \n\n\nSo Lewin wanted to see if having a black salesperson really is detrimental to sales okay because of the complaint of white customers\n\n\nOkay so he interviewed customers as they went out the stores okay and asked them would you buy from a black salesperson \n\n\nAnd many of them said no\n\n\nAnd yet when he went inside the store and observed okay it was not true\n\n\nThey were buying also from black personnel\n\n\nThere was no difference between a black and the white personnel\n\n\nOkay they were buying from any salesperson regardless of race, \n\n\nOkay so with this research he showed the complaints of white clients were not founded and there was no reason to take out black salespersons, because sales was not affected by their color or their race, \n\n\nOther research seems to counter what Lewin did <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nWherein he says if you want attitudes to change you should change the behavior first, \n\n\nWhere usually the belief is if you want behavior to change change the attitude first\n\n\nHe showed through his research that the opposite can also be done, and he showed this in policies by changing policies of universities regarding admissions, \n\n\nThis practice is still being done in in several universities in the U S okay wherein they have a quota for different racial groups\n\n\nOkay and they have to fill that quota\n\n\nSo if their aim is to have twenty percent admissions black admissions they have to fill the twenty percent, \n\n\nIf only fifteen qualified they should still active actively recruit five percent more okay\n\n\n Ganoon talaga  \n\n\nActive recruitment to fill the quota okay to make sure that the races are represented in the universities\n\n\nAnd he said only if you forced universities to integrate black whites Indians Asians, okay so you 're changing the behavior\n\n\nYou 're forcing them to go together in one place\n\n\nEventually it will result in change in attitudes, \n\n\nOkay think of one group right now which you cannot stand, if any\n\n\n Ano  \n\n<$B> \n\nIraqis\n\n<$A> \n\nIraqis\n\n\nIf I force you to be together in one room even for a week\n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nOr  hindi  in a nicer place in uh a beach house\n\n\nOkay  kung andoon kayo anong mangyayari  \n\n\nOkay in a nice place\n\n\nIf you are put together in a favorable setting such as that your attitudes will change\n\n\nAnd by forcing you to change behaviors you will force yourself to get to know the other group okay\n\n\nAnd he showed that also with his research\n\n\nNow because of this Lewin now he was given recognition, in that every year there is now a Kurt Lewin award, given to a psychologist who has contributed to the study of social issues, \n\n\nAre there any questions about my favorite psychologist, \n\n\nI assume you have no criticisms, \n\n\nAnd so <unclear> words </unclear> I like about Lewin his major theory is in topology\n\n\nThe one that we discussed last time  psychophysical field\n\n\nHe also branched out into other areas\n\n\nOkay all of these are very different from his psychophysical field\n\n\nOkay \n\n\n Walang tanong  \n\n\nOkay we 'll move on to a new topic\n\n\nClinical psychology, \n\n\nDuring the Renaissance okay so that 's around the fourteenth to the fifteenth century, mental illness was viewed very differently\n\n\nWhat do you think were the early views of mental illness, \n\n<$C> \n\nAbnormal\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah abnormal but what 's the cause of it\n\n<$C> \n\nEvil spirits\n\n<$A> \n\nEvil spirits demon possession witchcraft and so on, \n\n\nOkay for example one of the first books, to be written about what actually was mental illness was the \"  Mallus Mallificarum  \", \n\n\nThat 's a that 's a book the title of a book, \n\n\nIn fourteen eighty-seven written by two bishops so it had the approval of the church, \n\n\nIt had three sections, \n\n\nLiterally every <unclear> words </unclear>, \n\n\nIt had three sections\n\n\nFirst it gave proof that witches exist, \n\n\nThe second part which is of more interest to us is it gave descriptions of characteristics and behaviors of witches\n\n\nOkay it gave descriptions of characteristics and behaviors of witches\n\n\nAnd if these descriptions were read by psychologists today or by you you 'd recognize that many of them were actually traits of mentally ill people\n\n\nLike symptoms of depression hallucination paranoia schizophrenia\n\n\nOkay uhm if you were to read it today you would recognize it as actually symptoms of mental disorders\n\n\nOkay and at that time at that time it was recognized as behaviors of being a witch, \n\n\nOkay the \"  Mallus  \" said that witchcraft comes from, carnal lust\n\n\nOkay witchcraft comes from carnal lust which is then which satisfaction then is sought from the devil, \n\n\nOkay and he says the reason why there are more women who are witches is that this carnal lust is never satisfied in women,  \n\n\nOkay according to the two bishops who were men who wrote \"  Mallus Mallificarum  \" \n\n\nAnd in fact at the time about eighty-five percent of all witches who were executed were women\n\n\n Talagang mas marami talaga  \n\n\nMore women were witches or identified as witches, \n\n\nAnd part three of the \"  Mallus  \" describes ways of identifying witches, \n\n\nOkay like for example one way is by burning at the stake\n\n\n 'Pag hindi sila nasunog  okay they won't burn that means they 're a witch in which case they 'll be killed\n\n\nOkay now if they die at the stake it means that they were not witches\n\n\nBut soon they die\n\n\nSo either way as soon as the person is identified as a witch  wala na talo na  okay\n\n\nNo matter what trial they use the witch or the alleged witch may end up being dead, \n\n\nOkay so because witchcraft is believed at that time to be caused by demons or devils the most popular form of taking care of of what we now know as mental illness is by either by killing by executions\n\n\nOkay or by driving away the evil spirits, \n\n\nFor example here are some paintings sixteenth sixteenth century paintings\n\n\nOkay this one shows exorcism okay of two men who showed symptoms of mental illness\n\n\nAnd after exorcism the demons came out after which they were cured\n\n\nIn this very small picture two people burn at the stake and while being burned again the demons were driven away\n\n\nAnd so whatever the method the logic is to drive away the demons from the body, \n\n\nIn fifteen forty-seven in London, the first institution for the mentally insane was constructed\n\n\nIt was officially called the Saint Mary of Bethlehem okay but its nickname is Old Bedlam, \n\n\n Kasi ang gulo, magulo sa loob, \n\n\nOkay at that time there were caretakers who took care of the inmates\n\n\nThey had a very small salary okay so what they did they allowed outsiders to go into Old Bedlam pay admission and then look at the inmates okay\n\n\n Parang zoo  \n\n\nOkay here 's again a painting of Old Bedlam\n\n\n Eto yung  mentally insane\n\n\nHere are two rich ladies who paid admission to go in\n\n\nSo they can view the inmates\n\n\nAt that time other disorders other kinds of mental disorders were not allowed in the institution\n\n\nLike for example if a person is suffering from depression okay the person is allowed to roam the streets because a depressed person really will not harm anyone\n\n\nOkay and if a depressed person is in the institution it 's not fun viewing a depressed person, or it does not make for attractive viewing\n\n\nSo the kinds of people that they put in are those which are schizophrenic and those who are violent those who are chained\n\n\nOkay it attracts more viewers than, \n\n\nInstitutions of that kind, they were now all over Europe\n\n\nBut in many of those institutions the care provided was not really to cure the mental illness but more custodial care\n\n\nOkay so simply giving food and shelter, to the people who were already in the institutions\n\n\nThe violent ones were chained, okay and what is common at that time once you go in really you practically never go out okay because those people do not become cured of their mental illness, \n\n\nPhilippe Pinel, was the first to institute reforms in these mental institutions, \n\n\nHis interest in studying the insane began when a very close friend of his suffering from manic depression came to him one time and told him about the problem, \n\n\nOkay at one point during one of his manic fits okay the friend went into the woods okay where he got lost and was eaten by wolves\n\n\nAnd so he was greatly disturbed by that and he spent the rest of his life doing studies on the insane\n\n\nOkay so  doon nagsimula ang  interest  niya  on the insane\n\n\nHis philosophy was that the insane were not animals okay that should be viewed but rather people who need treatment, \n\n\nWhen he wrote an article okay describing how the insane should be treated it caught the attention of a government official who was in charge of hospitals in Paris and that 's how he became he was assigned to this  mental institution for men, <unclear> word </unclear> Paris, in seventeen ninety-three, \n\n\nThe first thing he did was to unchain some of the inmates\n\n\nOkay with very strong opposition from the other supervisors\n\n\nOne of the men that he unchained okay was one who killed one of the guards okay with his chains manacles\n\n\nAnd he had killed one of the guards before and yet when he unchained him the man suddenly became very gentle\n\n\nAnd two years later the man was completely cured okay and assisted Pinel in the asylum the insane asylum\n\n\nOkay so he showed that humane treatment, okay is always necessary for curing the insane\n\n\nAnd the reason why they were not cured is because of the inhumane treatment that they were getting,",

{"text": "<$A> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> allows some teachers especially those of us who do other things other than teaching to run wild at least once in a year\n\n\nIn the past two years I 've done just that\n\n\nUhm it allows us to teach the way we want to teach\n\n\nNow I am a poet as well as a teacher\n\n\nI think Robert Frost said something about uh vocation and avocation\n\n\nIn my case  uh my vocation is poetry my avocation is teaching\n\n\nBut as uh Robert Frost says it  'no   my vocation and my avocation, like my two eyes make one sight  \n\n\nAnd I would like to share with you this sight for for uh our alternative class\n\n\nI would like to, experiment uhm in terms of creativity that is a shared kind of creativity\n\n\nI believe that all students have have it in their hearts and in their minds to write poetry\n\n\nNow it might seem impossible but uhm you 'll never know unless we try, \n\n\nNow I have I propose to do three very very simple things today\n\n\nI will, I will share with you what I mean by creative reading and creative writing\n\n\nAnd then uh we will look into two kinds of poems one which I had done and this is written in the experimental mode\n\n\nWe tried this out uhm we had uh a huge workshop with the Philippine Educational Theatre Association PETA\n\n\nYou 're familiar with PETA\n\n\nAnd uh we had uh a festival of the arts and at Fort Santiago, \n\n\nThey they placed the poem on a sheet on a large sheet of paper and uh we invited the audience to write their own poetry based on the poem because the poem is not a dead text, \n\n\nThe poem is a living text\n\n\nSo when you read you also make your own poem in effect\n\n\nSo this poem can replicate itself can be written in many in as many ways as there are many different kinds of readings\n\n\nSo I 'll be giving you the text later on\n\n\nAnd then we will see if we can do something about it uhm either uh individually or maybe by dyads  'no  since this is a large group\n\n\nThe second exercise that we will go into after we have done the first one is uh to make some very very short charms  'no  \n\n\nCharms are, one of the oldest forms of, poetry and it is hinged on the idea that words can heal as well as hex or hurt\n\n\nDo you  do you know this\n\n\nDo you understand this\n\n\nI think you 've tried this once in a while use words to love or to heal and uh you can also use words to hurt or to hex  'no  like when you say  madapa ka sana 'no  that 's that 's hexing\n\n\nNow in poetry it is a very specialized form\n\n\nI will give you a model for this\n\n\nWe will read the model first and then you will do your own\n\n\nNow this is not impossible because I have tried this out in uh in some of my LITFORM  classes\n\n\nUhm the LITFORM class that I have here uhm we will try that when we reach poetry\n\n\nNow after we do uh the two poems if we still have time and if you still want we can go into another writing exercise\n\n\nUh we will try to write our our own stories based on a story  'no  using uhm how we feel and how we think about things\n\n\nOkay uhm is that clear to you what we are here for, \n\n\nAny suggestions or comments so far, \n\n\nNone\n\n\nOkay uhm I will can you please help me uh distribute\n\n\nI only have fifty copies of the of the text so maybe uhm people can share the the text okay, \n\n\nOkay again that as a teacher and as a poet I believe that there is a very direct relationship between reading well and writing well\n\n\nSo if you want to be writers if you want to write more clearly you have to read lucidly, \n\n\nUhm how does one read a poem\n\n\nOne goes into the heart of it  'no  \n\n\nSo there are many levels at which you can approach a poem\n\n\nAnd one of them is and the best of them is to use your imagination when you are reading uh the words because the words have to mean more than what they are\n\n\nPut together they should mean like music\n\n\nThey should move you in its own melting  'no  \n\n\nNow uhm I have written here on the board one of the one of the names that you encounter in the poem, Chikibu, \n\n\nShe is uh a court poet\n\n\nShe was writing poetry in uh Heian Japan in the Heian dynasty\n\n\nAnd uh she wrote very very short poems which however like little dynamites they were deadly when they exploded  'no  inside inside the person because then the person had to be changed forever\n\n\nWhen the poem reached the heart of that person the person was not the same anymore after reading it well or after hearing it well\n\n\nNow  Izumi Chikibu is used as an allusion in the poem \" Sagada Stills \"  'no  which is our first text for today\n\n\nUhm the other person that is in that poem if you look at it very  carefully\n\n\nThere is another name there uhm yes anyone yes you found it\n\n\nMaskere\n\n\nAre you familiar with Eduardo Maskere\n\n\nNo you 've never heard his name say hello to him\n\n\n Maskere is a Filipino\n\n\nHe recorded with his camera\n\n\nHe did not have any uhm formal training in photography or art of photography\n\n\nBut he recorded with his camera a very simple one when he started the life of the Cordillera and its people in the nineteen fifties and uhm a group of people who have seen his photographs have put it together in a book entitled \" Maskere \" \n\n\nIt won the National Book Award in the Philippines about uh three years ago and uhm he has presented to us unforgettable pictures of uh Cordillera the northern part of the Philippines which I think we should all visit sometime in our lives\n\n\nIf you haven't seen the Banawe Rice Terraces you should try to do that not as tourists but as a but as students of culture your own culture because it is I think it is the epitome of the best  'no  in the in the spirit of the Filipino\n\n\nWe always hear very negative things about ourselves as Filipinos\n\n\nBut if we do that uh if we go we go up there it is a healing process\n\n\nNow Eduardo Maskere used whatever light was available\n\n\nMaybe like all kinds of artists whether you are a musician a poet a photographer uhm a painter\n\n\nYou use whatever materials are available and then you make the best out of it\n\n\nNow here uh he has presented uhm the Cordillera\n\n\nI will show you some of his pictures so that you will understand who Eduardo Maskere is\n\n\nBy the way this is part of good reading\n\n\nIf we encounter words and names that we do not know we try to get to know them and love them  'no  \n\n\nLearning is loving well\n\n\nIf you don't love what you learn it will not mean anything in one 's life\n\n\nI think that 's what we mean by alternative education\n\n\nThe ordinary education is facts what you memorize and then throw out after a term\n\n\nThe real education is what you keep  'no  and that which grows with you as you grow older and it gets better as you grow older okay\n\n\nHere 's the picture of Sagada\n\n\nHave you have you heard of Sagada\n\n\nIt is uhm about, you go from here to uh Bontoc for about eight to ten hours\n\n\nAnd then another two hours through very very rough but beautiful terrain\n\n\nAnd then you reach Sagada\n\n\nI think it is the skyworld in the Philippines\n\n\nIf you want to know how the skyworld looks like and how the sky beings used to be in the midst of the Philippines you should visit Sagada\n\n\nBut again I warn you not as tourists, but as lovers of your own culture, \n\n\nThis, can you see it\n\n\nMaybe I 'll show you I 'll show this too\n\n\nThis is the picture of the Cordillera\n\n\nIf you if you 've gone to Baguio maybe about ten or fifteen years ago when you were still children and if you had a magical childhood that probably uhm made its effect on your imagination\n\n\nIt 's uh, this is the vision of the the photographer of the forest as well as of the the mountains of Sagada, \n\n\nI think this this is one of the best uh photographs that Eduardo Maskere\n\n\nHe 's he 's a self-taught photographer but uh it 's pure art because he saw with his heart, \n\n\n<unclear> phrase </unclear> of the Cordillera people\n\n\nHere 's the man who is uh, the artist  'no  and the singer and he 's playing on the nose flute okay\n\n\nUhm there 's another, picture of a warrior, very proud, being with full dignity and integrity very very unlike many of the Filipinos now, \n\n\nMuch better than many of us now, \n\n\nOkay now I 'm showing this all to you because when I wrote that poem \" Sagada Stills \" it was occasioned by a a visit to the Bontoc and Cordillera area\n\n\nAnd uh when I reached Sagada I realized what it is what it was like to imagine as a Filipino would imagine\n\n\nBut because when one writes one includes a whole world of experience\n\n\nOne includes one 's reading also and I have read Izumi Chikibu\n\n\nUhm I 'm very much attached as a poet to the Japanese and Chinese uh poets\n\n\nAnd uh Izumi Chikibu is one of the best, uh women poets that I have ever encountered one of the best poets in the entire world\n\n\nIf you read just this  haiku  or it 's uh it 's a  tanka  it says  in this world love has no color yet how deeply stained my body is with yours  \n\n\nNow if you don't  if you don't understand that you 'd probably have to experience it first\n\n\nOkay uhm now what will we do with the poem that you have uhm, \n\n\nWill you will you please open that uh you have your text with you, \n\n\nThis poem was recently published in the Tampa Review of Florida and uhm I think it 's because they were trying to put together an experimental uh volume of experimental work\n\n\nI was trying to experiment with sheer creativity\n\n\nAs a poet I believe that creativity is communal\n\n\nIt is done by an individual but it is within the context of a community\n\n\nNow since education I think effectively kills our creativity in many many ways uhm it seems as if poetry or the writing of literature is the is the province of a very select few very rare people\n\n\nWe call them weird sometimes  'no  weird, weird and wild\n\n\nBut uhm I think everyone can write if they know how to see with the imagination not just with the eyes\n\n\nThe eyes are literal  'no  but the imagination is metaphoric\n\n\nNow it is in the metaphoric level where you can write something\n\n\nNow when I wrote this uh poem uh as I said it was occasioned by uh a visit with a friend to this beautiful place in the Philippines and I realized the, the limits of art when you are in front of something so beautiful  'no  \n\n\nYou can try to paint something\n\n\nYou can try to catch it with a photograph\n\n\nMaybe Maskere is is uh luckier than I am because a single picture as they say is worth a thousand words\n\n\nBut I work with words as a poet\n\n\nSo I was trying to capture what Maskere had captured\n\n\nNow when I wrote this I tried to experiment with the visual form of the poem\n\n\nAs you can see it, there when I first finished this and I showed this to my daughter\n\n\nMy daughter is twenty-one years old\n\n\nShe uh, yes she she said the immediate reaction that she had was how does one read this\n\n\nAnd I said exactly\n\n\nRead it anywhere anyway you want  'no  \n\n\nThat is my great experiment\n\n\nNow as I said there will be as many poems as there will be different kinds of reading\n\n\nI will just share with you what my Chinese friend did okay\n\n\nWhen he saw the text, he looked at it and he said I 'll read it the Chinese way\n\n\nHow is the Chinese way, \n\n\nYes\n\n\n They read it from right to left  \n\n\nFrom right to left\n\n\nIsn't it also from top, to bottom okay\n\n\nSo that is possible  'no  \n\n\nBut my but my daughter was more uh playful with it so she played hop-scotch with it\n\n\nDo you know how to play hop-scotch, \n\n\nStep-no\n\n\nYou know how to do that and then you jump like this\n\n\nYou can do that with the poem too\n\n\nSo if you are playful  'no  you can play with the with the whole text and then you can make your own poem\n\n\nWhat we will do is I 'll give you about fifteen minutes of quiet to just meditate and and look at the poem and then you write your own version\n\n\nAnd after that you write there on top where my name is as author Marjorie Evasco and Chet Chan because that 's our poem okay\n\n\nUhm is that clear to you\n\n\nNow before we go into that exercise let 's read that first\n\n\nTry try to read it the ordinary way okay\n\n\nMeaning to say syntactically, in terms of its syntax the poem is trying to make some sense but like a poem it can make many other senses or many other uh meanings\n\n\nSo ordinarily in the usual way how you how would you read a text\n\n\nYou go from left to right or like this okay\n\n\nSo we will try that\n\n\nThat 's the most ordinary and maybe what most readers will do\n\n\nI 'll read it because it 's in my it 's my poem okay\n\n\n Sagada Stills in a floating world, if with images if with words I you could catch on photographic film on silk paper a likeness of you of me in Sagada I would have you would have to set a thousand years with master of austere light measure Maskere Chikibu to learn the process of rendering silence of staining sound , \n\n\nOkay I will not explain my own poem because it is a shared poem as I as I told you it is a love poem  'no  okay", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThe last time we met we were talking about space the different kinds of space and the metaphysical uh consequences of these\n\n\nWe said that uh metaphysics or the problems of metaphysics were born essentially in the context of the general perception of space as Euclidean\n\n\nWe said that Euclidean space is structureless and empty\n\n\nIn it the application of uh the Parmenidian postulates results in, uh a an ontology which begins with non-being and ends with non-being\n\n\nTherefore humans especially philosophical humans who encounter things in space are surprised why there are things rather than nothing and therefore uh are moved to search for explanations for the things in space\n\n\nThe analogy there is with uh a blank screen a blank movie screen without contents in it\n\n\nNow supposing we have uh a movie in the movie screen but we cannot find any projector anywhere nor anything behind the screen we would wonder why there is a movie going on without any projector projecting anything on the screen\n\n\nThe uh question we would ask would be similar to the question we ask why is there something rather than nothing \n\n\nHowever we said that uh in non-Euclidean space the existence of things in space specifically space-time, uh changing and with the history, would be unnatural\n\n\nWe have therefore a mind which expects Euclidean space to be there okay, and wonders why there are things in this\n\n\nWe ask for an explanation\n\n\nWe did not realize that the space we had was the Euclidean\n\n\nAs a matter of fact the mind has thought for a long time that Euclidean space is the only possible space\n\n\nIt was only in the eighteenth nineteenth century that the idea of non-Euclidean space is, became uh  uh perceivable through the efforts of <unclear> name </unclear> uh <unclear> name </unclear> and <unclear> name </unclear> and finally by <unclear> name </unclear> \n\n\nThis is a happy thing for philosophy particularly when Einstein came along and deduced from from uh his theory that space-time <unclear> word </unclear> space-time would have contents not only contents but contents which interact with each other and which interact with space-time itself\n\n\nOkay there were problems of course with the with the uh relativity\n\n\nAnd one of the problems of relativity was its seeming uh conflict classical conflict with quantum mechanics which uh relativity we said was deterministic while quantum mechanics is essentially indeterministic\n\n\nAnd the two would not be reconciled until in recent years uh we came up with super strings and perhaps super membrane uh space-time, \n\n\nOkay uh so it seems that uh the ontological question is no longer impossible to solve\n\n\nWilliam James had believed that there was no bridge between being and non-being and that was because William James although he lived in the twentieth century was not able to connect relativity with existence\n\n\nSimilarly uh Alfred North Whitehead also made almost the same almost the same remark\n\n\nHe said there is no reason why this flux history\n\n\nThis flux rather than another flux has been illustrated apart from history\n\n\nIn other words apart from the given uh forces of nature already there without this given given history and no reasons can be given why a particular history rather than another history has been illustrated\n\n\nOkay now we shall uh go on to another problem in philosophy and this is the problem of causality\n\n\nSomehow instinctively men have believed that events have causes that no events can take place without a cause\n\n\nThis was the conclusion of such uh pre-Socratic philosophers as Parmenides and Anaxamander uh Leucippus Democritus Plato Aristotle and so forth\n\n\nDemocritus uh put it uh succinctly as follows  nothing happens without a cause or reason   'no  \n\n\nOkay whenever something happens we always ask what 's the cause  'no  \n\n\nWhat is the cause\n\n\nIn other words it seems that belief in causality is ingrained in the human mind  'no  \n\n\nKant uh believed that uh powers to perceive causal relationships are also ingrained but he said it is ingrained in the categories  'no  \n\n\nThe categories the structures of the mind which by which we experience an orderly universe\n\n\nKant believed that it is impossible for anyone to experience a completely disorderly universe\n\n\nThe only universe that can be  experienced are is a universe that is orderly and the ordering apparatus are the categories, \n\n\nOkay let us first uh explain them the two current uh, hypotheses about causality\n\n\nThe first one who came up with a hypothesis about causality was of course David Hume  'no , \n\n\nDavid Hume was an empiricist, \n\n\nHe followed in the tradition of John Locke, Berkeley George Berkeley and finally himself David Hume\n\n\nNow David Hume following his tradition and then bringing this to the logical conclusion his logical conclusion uh thought  'no  that the materials of our knowledge are essentially two  'no  ultimately reducible to one namely impressions and ideas\n\n\nImpressions come first then ideas, \n\n\nSimple ideas must have an uh antecedents in simple impressions\n\n\nYou cannot for example think of the color red unless you have seen the color red before\n\n\nIf you are born color blind you will not know what redness then is\n\n\nIf you are born without the sense of pain you would not know what pain is\n\n\nBut you can having these simple ideas you are able then to combine them  'no  into complex ideas which you may not have experienced before  'no  because of the imagination\n\n\nThe mind has two powers imagination and memory\n\n\nMemory in memory okay we have ideas of things we have experienced in orderly sequence\n\n\nBut in imagination the ideas may be jumbled  'no  in any order we wish\n\n\nThat 's why we are able to write fiction\n\n\nWe are able to draw strange characters  'no   etcetera etcetera  \n\n\nThe although in imagination the mind is free to combine ideas anyway it wants  'no  \n\n\nNevertheless there are certain tendencies of the mind which uh make it tend to associate certain ideas with each other  'no  \n\n\nIt 's the law of association okay\n\n\nAnd the laws of association are governed by three mechanisms contiguity in other words two ideas closely associated with each other okay uh become so associated that the existence of one the impression of one will involve the other contiguity, resemblance, two ideas which resemble each other recall each other and the third one is cause and effect\n\n\nThis is the one we are interested in cause and effect\n\n\nCause and effect again is uh associated through constant conjunction\n\n\nCause and effect is associated through constant conjunction\n\n<$B> \n\nSir\n\n<$A> \n\nSo that\n\n<$B> \n\nSir  'yong  uh so uh <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nThree three mechanisms  'no  \n\n\nOkay uh, contiguity, resemblance and cause and effect okay\n\n\nIn the process of the constant conjunction of ideas the happening of impression the happening of one impression recalls the other  'no  \n\n\nOkay whether the one that is uh previous that the antecedent one is called a cause and the uh what was the other of antecedent\n\n\nAntecedent and, I forgot it\n\n\nIt 's not consequent\n\n\n\" Consequent \" is a logical term\n\n\nAnyway the one that follows is called the uh <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n\nNow since David Hume was an empiricist he wanted very much to analyze just what from the viewpoint of empiricism are the elements of causality, \n\n\nOkay he was able to distinguish three elements namely succession\n\n\nThere is a succession of events  'no  \n\n\nUh let us say for example you have a you want to smoke a cigarette you want to light your cigarette  'no  \n\n\nAlright there 's a succession of events\n\n\nYou get your lighter  'no  \n\n\nFlip it\n\n\nThe lighter uh uh lights up okay\n\n\nYou bring the light to the lighter to your cigarette and it comes in contact with the cigarette\n\n\nOkay the cigarette lights okay and you blow out the light of the lighter\n\n\nThat 's it  'no  \n\n\nOkay a succession succession of events  'no  \n\n\nA succession of events okay\n\n\nThe second one is \" contiguity \"  'no  \n\n\nContiguity contiguity according to David Hume is an element in causality  'no  \n\n\nThe cause must come in contact with the effect  'no  \n\n\nThe cause must come in contact with the effect\n\n\nOkay the light the  the flame of the lighter must come in contact with the cigarette before the cigarette will light  'no  \n\n\nWe somehow believe that gravity also exhibits this kind of of uh property  'no  \n\n\nThere is in other words for Hume no such thing as an action at a distance  'no  \n\n\nIt 's always some kind of, of contact between the cause and the effect\n\n\nYet it\n\n<$C> \n\nUh what what governs the law of association \n\n<$A> \n\nThe law of association\n\n<$C> \n\nYes what were what are the <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nOh what governs it what governs it\n\n<$C> \n\nResemblance of\n\n<$A> \n\nOh okay resemblance uh contiguity resemblance contiguity\n\n<$C> \n\nThe same definition\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo oo  \n\n<$C> \n\nThe same definition\n\n<$A> \n\nThe same definition\n\n\nThey are close together, closely associated with each other\n\n\nContiguity\n\n\nOkay I guess I guess in causality the contiguity means contact  'no  \n\n\nPhysical contact  'no  \n\n\nThe contiguity in causality means physical contact\n\n\nIn the former one I guess contiguity means close association\n\n\nOkay the third element is necessary connection  'no  \n\n\nThe third element is necessary connection\n\n\nSo we have succession of events contiguity necessary connection\n\n\nOkay supposing supposing I throw this piece of chalk\n\n\nLet us say this is a piece of rock  'no  \n\n\nThis is a piece of rock and this is a piece of glass\n\n\nSupposing now I throw this piece of chalk to the piece of glass\n\n\nThere 's a succession of events, \n\n\nThe glass breaks  'no  \n\n\nThe glass glass breaks upon contiguity  'no  \n\n\nUpon contact  'no  alright okay\n\n\nAnd then the necessary connection is I believe now that it was the contact of the rock with the glass that broke the glass  'no  \n\n\nAlright  'no  \n\n\nIt broke the glass okay\n\n\nSo he now analyzed where this necessary connection comes from  'no  where this necessary connection comes from because it seemed that from the viewpoint of empiricism it has no objective basis\n\n\nHe thinks that, I could just as much believe that upon contact with the piece of glass the glass will harden rather than break  'no  \n\n\nOr upon contact with my cigarette the cigarette the cigarette will will freeze rather than burn  'no  \n\n\nSo there is no logical connection between the cause and effect\n\n\nThe necessary connection then is not logical but psychological  'no  \n\n\nIt 's not a logical connection\n\n\nIt is a psychological connection\n\n\nI have no impression in other words according to Hume of a necessary connection between the cause and the effect  'no  \nICE-PHI:#126> Okay so he says then then  'no  that the element of necessary connection is due  'no  not so much to the logical connection between cause and effect but to habit and custom  'no  \n\n\nThe constant conjunction of events between cause and effect creates a habit in the mind okay to associate the two so that the happening of one will cause the other whether the effect or the cause\n\n\nYou have an effect you recall the cause\n\n\nYou have the cause you think of the effect  'no  \n\n\nIt is the habit that establishes the psychological feeling that there must be a necessary connection between the cause and the effect  'no  \n\n\nThis is a  completely empiricistic analysis of causality\n\n\nAnd that in short gives you the Humeian concept of causality\n\n\nCausality is not an objective relation between things\n\n\nIt is a subjective  you might say imposition  'no  by the mind on the world\n\n\nAs far as the world is concerned the objective world is concerned things could happen differently  'no  than what the mind expects uh things to do uh to happen\n\n\nOkay now uh Kant of course we all know that Kant read this book of David Hume and Kant one of you know was a dogmatist\n\n\nHe when after reading it he said David Hume 's book had uh awakened him from his dogmatic slumber  'no  \n\n\nOkay he got some important ideas from David Hume called causality but he did not agree with Hume  'no  \n\n\nHe did not agree with Hume that causality is due to mere habit  'no  engendered by the constant conjunction of impressions\n\n\n Ang kanya naman sabi niya  there seems to be an element of universality and necessity in the cause and effect relation\n\n\nIf it were merely a case of habit and custom there would be no sense of universality and uh necessity\n\n\nSo he said where then is the locus of this feeling of necessity\n\n\nIs it in the habit\n\n\nHe agreed with Hume that it is subjective  'no  \n\n\nThe locus of this feeling of necessity is not objective but subjective\n\n\nHe says it must also be subjective  'no  \n\n\nBut it 's not habit\n\n\nIt 's not custom\n\n\nIt must be an innate structure of the mind  'no  which he identified as two  'no  the intuitions composed of time and space and the categories composed of twelve categories one of which is causality  'no  \n\n\nIn other words causality is a category of the mind\n\n\nThis category of the mind  'no  imposes itself upon the phenomena so that we necessarily think in terms of cause and effect  'no  that the world is necessarily ordered\n\n\nIn other words the orderliness of the universe the laws of nature  'no  are necessary\n\n\nThey cannot be altered  'no  \n\n\nBut the necessity is not out there\n\n\nThe necessity is in the mind  'no  through the operation of the categories\n\n\n 'Yan 'no  \n\n\nSo we have two different uh theories about causality", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source":

that the exact word\n\n<$A> \n\nIs that a\n\n<$K> \n\nThe exact words\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah this is taken supposedly in ELESTA one\n\n\nThat 's why we assume when you go to ELESTA two you know this very well\n\n\nOkay so the Pearson Product Moment Correlation for those who just uh had a casual casual uh introduction to it okay\n\n\nPearson Product Moment Correlation is used when you want to determine the relationship, okay the same term that you were giving the relationship between\n\n<$J> \n\nTwo\n\n<$A> \n\nTwo variables which are expressed, in interval or ratio scale, \n\n\nOkay so the prerequisite here is that the type of scale that you have is either interval or ratio\n\n\nUsually in psych  you have uh test scores test scores\n\n\nNow the size of a correlation coefficient ranges from negative one to positive one okay, \n\n\nOkay it 's negative one to positive one\n\n\nSo any value that you get which is more than one that means your answer is wrong\n\n\nWhat does it mean when you have a negative one to a positive one <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n\nOkay we have a graph, \n\n\nThis is the y axis and the x axis\n\n\nWhen it 's negative it means that the higher the y the lower the x, \n\n\nSo that 's the relationship between the variables\n\n\nThe higher the y the lower the x, \n\n\nWhen it 's positive okay, the two of them increase the same way\n\n\nAs x increases y increases so the line is straight\n\n\nOkay clear\n\n\nNow if you graph the two scores the x and the y okay and you can't seem to draw a straight to draw a straight line uh either in this direction or in this direction okay\n\n\nThis may indicate that there is a zero correlation\n\n\nThat means there 's no relationship between the two variables\n\n\nSo a negative one and a positive one is you have such a straight line\n\n\nThis only happens theoretically okay\n\n\nWhat usually happens is that you can draw a straight line forcing it  'no  but the points do not exactly fall there but somewhere close\n\n\nThat 's why you can form a straight line there\n\n\nBut not exactly passing through all the points okay\n\n\nNow when it 's like that you can have a moderately negative, \n\n\nIt 's moderate negative  'no  okay\n\n\nThis one 's clearly negative\n\n\nSo this means that somehow it 's negative but it 's not perfect\n\n\n'Cause if you have a perfect one it would be uh the line would be very straight this way but we don't usually have that\n\n\nSame way with the positive we don't have a clear straight line  always there with some points falling there okay\n\n\nSo of course when you have a zero <unclear> words </unclear> that means there 's nothing there 's no relationship at all between the two variables\n\n\nSo, what makes this a zero are the scattered dots the scattered dots\n\n\nOkay how do we describe a correlation coefficient okay\n\n\nThe answer to the Pearson Product Moment Correlation is a correlation coefficient\n\n\nUsually when we have point three to point seventy-nine\n\n\nIt 's moderate  \n\n\nBelow point three that means below point three or point twenty-nine below point eighty and above, high, \n\n\nOkay, okay\n\n\nSo the coefficient describes the degree of relationship between the two variables okay\n\n\nSo when we hit a point eighty this means that the lines are pretty are quite it 's pretty much this way\n\n\nThat means the dots the y and the x meet almost in a straight line okay but not yet perfect\n\n\nBecause we only get a straight line when we <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nNow if it is moderate that means many points are outside that line\n\n\nAnd if it 's zero we are <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nQuestion, question, \n\n\nNo more okay\n\n\nWere you taught how to compute it in ELESTA one\n\n\nOkay now Pearson Product Moment Correlation is one of the easiest one of the easiest\n\n\nYou should know that by now okay\n\n\nOne of the easiest type of correlation\n\n\nEasiest okay\n\n\nWhat other correlation uh types of correlation did you study in ELESTA one\n\n<$L> \n Spearman\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay Spearman, \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nWhat else\n\n<$?> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah but you have <unclear> words </unclear> what else\n\n<$M> \n\nPoint-biserial  \n\n<$A> \n\nPoint point biserial point\n\n<$?> \n point biserial\n\n<$A> \n\nSo is this all\n\n\nYes we agree  \n\n<$Z> \n Miss \n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n\nNo way\n\n<$Z> \n No way\n\n<$A> \n\nThere 'll be another set\n\n\nThat 's why you 're not gonna take this\n\n\nI was told I was told by Mr Cordero and Ms Bernardo that <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$?> \n Pearson\n\n<$A> \n\nThere will be another set\n\n\nAnother set with fancier names, with nicer names okay\n\n\nClass now that you know something about it  'no  okay\n\n\nThere should be something that you   know about it  okay\n\n<$?> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so since you 've taken up the basics already okay whether or not you got uh you got a full lecture from Mr Cordero or not but he told me you took it okay \n\n\nSo now we proceed with different types of correlation okay\n\n\nYou will notice these types of correlation were used essentially when the variables are interval or ratio okay\n\n\nSo the variables may be initially interval or ratio and then converted to ordinal okay\n\n\nNow we go to another set of correlations okay which hopefully you will find useful as you when you write your thesis, \n\n\nOkay so what 's the first type of correlation that we 're gonna take up\n\n\nOkay the first type would be the \" Cramer \", \n\n\nOkay Cramer\n\n\nCramer coefficient\n\n\nSo what 's \" Cramer \" \n\n\n\" Cramer \" is used when you have two nominal variables, \n\n\nTwo nominal variables\n\n\nSo what 's an example of nominal variable\n\n<$?> \n Telephone numbers\n\n<$A> \n\nTelephone numbers\n\n<$?> \n Sex\n\n<$A> \n\nSex\n\n\nAnd then, \n\n\nWhat 's an example of nominal frequency type of variables  \n\n\nI D number okay\n\n\nOh for example you count the number of males and females in this class\n\n\nThat 's nominal, \n\n\nTwenty and then five\n\n\nYou count the number of freshmen sophomores juniors seniors in this class\n\n\nThat 's also\n\n<$?> \n Nominal\n\n<$A> \n\nNominal\n\n\nOkay so all you have are frequencies okay \n\n\nNow there are times that you want to correlate two variables which are expressed in this manner okay\n\n\nObviously you can't use \" Pearson \" anymore\n\n\nYou can't use \" Spearman \" anymore\n\n\nSo you use \" Cramer \" \n\n\nCramer coefficient okay\n\n\nWhat 's Cramer coefficient\n\n\nThe formula is , \n\n\nOkay by now you 're familiar with the with the big letter X squared\n\n\nThis is the  chi   chi  okay\n\n\nSo when you use Cramer coefficient you have to compute  chi  -square, <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nYou 've got to compute  chi  -square okay\n\n\nSo what else, \n\n\nSo L here will be the minimum number of rows and columns\n\n\nRows and columns\n\n<$?> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nIt can be two by three three by three , \n\n\nSo how do you test the significance okay\n\n\nObviously you look at Appendix C, \n\n\nSo degrees of freedom would be, r minus one\n\n\nR meaning rows okay\n\n\nK 's we mean column\n\n\nSo they use uh they use the symbol k it 's really c you want c it 's okay\n\n\nR minus one and C minus one\n\n<$?> \n Minimum number of rows and columns\n\n<$A> \n\nMinimum number of rows and columns for example, \n\n\nSo you have uh two by three right\n\n\nTwo by three contingency table\n\n\nYou have a two by three contingency table\n\n\nIt means that\n\n\nWhat 's L\n\n\nWhat 's L\n\n<$?> \n Two\n\n<$A> \n\nHow many how many rows do we have\n\n<$?> \n Three, \n\n<$A> \n\nHow many rows do we have\n\n<$?> \n Two, \n\n<$A> \n\nWhich one 's the smaller one\n\n<$?> \n Two\n\n<$?> \n Two\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's L\n\n<$?> \n Uh okay\n\n<$A> \n\nHow difficult this is\n\n\nR equals two whichever is the smallest number that 's L\n\n\nOkay it seldom happens to be two because if it 's two you have to use  phi  coefficient\n\n\nSo if it 's more than two it 's uh it 's not a two by two table you use uh Cramer 's\n\n<$?> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nYes whichever is the smallest one\n\n<$?> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nThey you it cannot be the same because the  phi  coefficient is used <unclear> word </unclear> two by two\n\n<$?> \n Three by three\n\n<$A> \n\nThree by, no it 's seldom the set up\n\n\n<unclear> words </unclear> it 's still three by three whatever is the smallest number\n\n<$?> \n one\n\n<$A> \n\nWhatever is the smallest number that 's it okay\n\n\nWhere is the two by two\n\n\nUsually it 's lopsided okay, \n\n\nGet it, \n\n<$?> \n -square for the formula\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah you have to compute  chi  -square first okay\n\n\nSo the  chi  -square here of course this time you know it by heart we hope you have to compute  chi  -square first,  chi  -square, okay are you\n\n<$?> \n -square part two\n\n<$A> \n\nNo this is uh you just need uh you just need uh\n\n<$?> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nYou need to you need to determine \" expected \" the way we do it here you have to compute \" expected \" first\n\n<$?> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nThere 's no need, obviously it 's not a test of goodness of fit it 's not \n\n\nAll you need automatic every time you see uh this it 's always always always okay\n\n\nBut let 's take an example,  'yan ,  \n\n\nIf you have this data, okay we assume that these are organizations student organizations in La Salle\n\n\nThere are about six okay\n\n\nThen we try to find out whether there 's a correlation between year level, and uh year level and uhm participation in student organizations, let 's put freshmen, \n\n\nOkay you want to find the relationship between membership in student organizations and the year level is there a correlation between the two okay\n\n\nSo let 's use  chi  -square first  \n\n\nOkay to compute your  \n\n\nOkay do it now, \n\n\nYou solve it you solve it\n\n\nGenevieve correct  \n\n\nOkay  \n\n\nOkay student organizations affiliations student organizations and level uh year level of students of De La Salle\n\n\nOkay, so since we need a  chi  -square so what was the first thing that uh we should have done with it  \n\n\nOkay get the \" expected \" okay so what are the chances uh computed the \" expected \" already right\n\n\nSo forty-nine the first the first column will be forty-nine, the first row rather will be forty-nine, \n\n\nOkay so you see here the \" expected \" already  'no  like this time from forty-nine times twenty-two divided by one hundred forty-four is seven plus forty-nine\n\n\nSo we need to do it for all the cells here okay all the cells all so after computing E for each uh cell then you add it all up\n\n\nYou should get an answer between seventy-five point zero nine to seventy-five point twenty-five okay", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "55892890-b21c-4cec-b614-3c55d65498d5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.068688+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> are faces of the same thing, \n\n\nThis this particular theory is called \" cultural materialism \" in England, \n\n\nIt is called \" new historicism \" in the United States\n\n\nThere are some minor differences between the two theories but they are not significant enough to concern us here in this class, \n\n\nSo when when we say \" cultural materialism \" and \" new historicism \" we mean the same thing, alright\n\n\nThe term \" cultural materialism \" was of course coined by Raymond Williams, \n\n\nNow \" cultural materialism \", is a term that is that is more or less self-explanatory\n\n\nMarxism as you know is dialectical materialism\n\n\nEverything is materialistic and everything is material and the method to analyze everything is dialectic alright\n\n\nCultural materialism applies Marxism to culture\n\n\nSee one of the problems with all the models of Marxism that we have studied so far is that the place of culture is not very clear, \n\n\nIt 's not certain in conventional forms of Marxism whether culture should stay in the base or whether it should stay in the superstructure, \n\n\nUh it 's supposed to be an ideology culture is supposed to be an ideology but whether it is material or not is not clear\n\n\nSo, cultural materialism, starts from from the Marxist analysis of culture\n\n\nIn a sense cultural materialism can be called a post-Marxism\n\n\nIn fact it is sometimes called a post-Marxism\n\n\nIt is it is a continuation of Marxism in the sense that the techniques and the insights of cultural materialism could not have been achieved without Marxism\n\n\nBut on the other hand it is a reaction to Marxism because cultural materialists realize that Marxism is extremely limited in its, grasp of culture\n\n\nSo basically cultural materialism believes that all culture is material\n\n\nImmediately therefore we are in the area of Bakhtin and company, \n\n\nRemember that it was Bakhtin and company who said that uh base and superstructure cannot be distinguished from each other as much as we would like to distinguish them because they are both material and the material is language\n\n\nNow cultural materialism does not believe that the material is language\n\n\nSo unlike Bakhtin and company the cultural materialists, uh believe in something else\n\n\nActually they believe that the material is economic\n\n\nIt 's still Marxist\n\n\nUh the base is still economic but uh literature or culture in general is part of the base, in the sense of Bakhtin in the sense that base and superstructure form a continuum\n\n\nAlright so cultural materialism then means that culture is regarded as a material object which therefore behaves in the same way that other material objects in society behave, \n\n\nNow uh new historicism, is is defined as uh old historicism influenced by newer things in particular post-structuralism uh neo-Marxism and feminism\n\n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nSir according to Eric David a culture is either material or immaterial\n\n\nAn immaterial culture is for example a belief a traditional belief\n\n<$A> \n\nFor cultural materialism everything in culture is material including beliefs and ideas and attitudes values etcetera\n\n\nEverything is material\n\n<$B> \n\nIt becomes material when it is expressed in language\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's Bakhtin\n\n<$B> \n\n  That 's Bakhtin  \n\n<$A> \n\n But in cultural materialism   you remove the language part\n\n<$B> \n\nSo how can they prove it as something material, \n\n\nSo how can they say that it is material if it 's, the manifestation itself is not really palpable, \n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's not palpable but it 's material\n\n\nFor example if I write a poem, and and I well first when I have to write it I use a pen which is material\n\n\nI use a paper which is material\n\n\nI send it to a magazine which is material\n\n\nThe magazine sends me uh, uh talent fee which is material and in other words I get paid as a worker for my poem which becomes a product\n\n\nSo in effect I am part of the economic base\n\n\nMy poem which I thought was intangible and impalpable and as you call it turns out to be something exactly the same as uh as a toothpaste tube, right\n\n\nExcept that it doesn't occupy space as in in my mind\n\n\nBut it occupies space in the magazine as well as on the piece of paper\n\n\nThat 's what uh taking the whole culture as material, \n\n\nOkay uh, uh now the key insight of Raymond Williams as far as cultural materialism is concerned is the insight that you find, on page one two three\n\n\nAt the bottom, \n\n\nThree last line\n\n\n Residual dominant and emergent cultures , \n\n\nThey 're really kinds of culture or aspects of culture residual dominant and emergent\n\n\nNow this is the key insight from which cultural materialism and new historicism come, \n\n\nRaymond uh Raymond Williams realized, that if you look at a culture there are really three kinds of cultures in every in everything you study\n\n\nIn every culture there are three things or aspects or types or shapes or forms that you can distinguish\n\n\nFirst there is that aspect of culture that you see all over the place\n\n\nThat 's the dominant culture\n\n\nActually we should talk of three cultures\n\n\nThe dominant culture is the culture that exists among the most number of people, kind of the majority culture\n\n\nThat 's the dominant culture\n\n\nNow the dominant culture of the past which still remains today is the residual culture, \n\n\nSo as time passes the dominant culture becomes residual\n\n\nThe culture of tomorrow which is already here but is not yet dominant but will be dominant in the future is the emergent culture\n\n\nSo it 's kind of like past present and future except that they exist in the same society in the same culture\n\n\nSo looked at synchronically a society has three cultures\n\n\nLooked at diachronically you can see the progress from of a culture from uh emergent to dominant to residual, \n\n\nSo let 's give some examples to make it clear\n\n\nLet us take technology because that 's the simplest\n\n\nAlright today the dominant culture in television technology is colored T V\n\n\nIf you go to any of our houses the chances are we will find a color television set in our houses\n\n\nThat 's dominant, \n\n\nAbout ten or twenty years ago uh there were very very few colored television sets\n\n\nMost television sets if they had any were black and white\n\n\nToday you still find some black and white sets, \n\n\nSo black and white television sets are residual\n\n\nColor television sets are dominant, \n\n\nWhat are emergent television sets\n\n\nWell we don't have very many of them in this country,  \n\n\nUh but that 's still television\n\n\nThat 's still the same thing\n\n\nIt 's just uh portable\n\n\nThere are portable black and white sets, \n\n\nStereophonic, \n\n\nFor example in Japan if you go to Japan and you want to watch a show in English you turn to the you turn on the T V set you switch on only the right speaker and you hear it in English\n\n\nYou switch on the left speaker you hear it in Japanese, \n\n\nThere was an attempt uh some years ago to introduce stereophonic uh television broadcasting in this country\n\n\nSo remember they you were supposed to attach your television set to your stereo and then it would come out stereophonic\n\n\nWell that kind of fizzled out because it was too expensive\n\n\nBut soon enough eventually all our television broadcasts will be stereophonic\n\n\nSo eventually it will be English on one channel on one speaker, Filipino in another speaker or uh or stereophonic\n\n\nI mean uh stereophonic sound, \n\n\nThat 's clearly emergent because the technology exists, \n\n\nIt exists with some people but uh, it 's not yet there for most of us, \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nSo that 's what it means\n\n\nWhat emergent means is that it exists\n\n\nIt 's not only an idea\n\n\nIt exists but it is so uh minimal that it doesn't really affect most of the people, \n\n\nBut we can see that eventually everybody will have that whatever it is\n\n\nSo eventually every television set will be stereophonic\n\n\nJust as every television set now is colored alright\n\n\nA T Ms in banking is dominant now\n\n\nA lot of people now go to little machines where they put in their card and get money\n\n\nBut there are still a lot of people who go to a counter and talk to the bank teller and get money from a real live person\n\n\nThat 's residual\n\n\nIf this were not dominant banks would not invest so much money obviously\n\n\nThey think that there 's enough people who are using cards to justify all this expense 'cause you can see A T Ms all over the place\n\n\nEventually, there will be no more actual bank teller because this would be the residual culture right\n\n\nWhat 's the emergent culture, in banking\n\n\nChina Banking has it now\n\n\nThis is not an ad\n\n\nThey now use a telephone, \n\n\nYou don't have to go to a bank to use this machine I don't know\n\n\nWith China Bank it 's their advertisement uh I don't have an account with them so I don't know if it works\n\n\nBut their advertisement said that you can use your telephone to do bank transactions, \n\n\nThat 's clearly emergent\n\n\nNobody has to go anywhere anymore\n\n\nA T M you still have to go out of the house and do this stuff\n\n\nYeah\n\n<$C> \n\nSir so we will not be using paper money anymore\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah of course   of course  \n\n<$C> \n\n Credit line   \n\n<$A> \n\nBut that 's another that 's another aspect altogether credit cards cash\n\n\nUh in the Philippines dominant is cash\n\n\nIn the United States it 's not cash\n\n\nThat 's residual\n\n\nIf you go to a department store and you pay cash they kind of look with this funny look in their faces and say you 're paying cash \n\n\nThis is really strange you know\n\n\nYou usually pay by check or credit cards, \n\n\nBut emergent is  \n\n\nKind of like kind of like credit cards  \n\n\nSo what does that mean  \n\n\nUh but that 's still cash\n\n\nThat 's still cash\n\n\nIn the future you won't have anything except your one card, uh which is your social security number which you use for all your transactions\n\n\nThat will be your banking card your driver 's license  etcetera  \n\n\nAnd there won't be all these so many cards that you hold in your wallet\n\n\nThat will be the future\n\n\nIn fact they have that already\n\n\nSometimes they use the same card to do all kinds of things like they do now\n\n\nOkay you get the general idea\n\n\nAlright electric typewriters, \n\n\nIan, if electric typewriters on  desks is the dominant culture what is the residual obviously  \n\n<$C> \n\nThe manual typewriter\n\n<$A> \n\nObviously the manual typewriter\n\n\nWhat is the emergent uh Nestor\n\n<$D> \n\nThe emergent Sir\n\n\nUhm computer\n\n<$A> \n\nWord processor the computer alright\n\n\nThat 's easy enough right\n\n\nNo problem with that\n\n\nHow about uh warfare\n\n\nCulture of warfare warfare uh in the last in the Gulf they were using basically tanks right\n\n\nThat 's the dominant culture\n\n\nJust tanks, \n\n\nSo Beverly what 's the residual culture\n\n<$E> \n\nSir guns\n\n<$A> \n\nGuns Uzis and stuff\n\n\nAll that thing\n\n\nAnd the emergent culture Charina\n\n<$F> \n\nSir Scud missiles nuclear\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah missiles\n\n\nSee how easy it is\n\n\nThis was a very simple insight\n\n\nIt took a genius like Williams to figure it out but it is such a simple insight, \n\n\nWhat is of course deep about it is that, history is linear\n\n\nIt keeps going so that eventually tanks will be residual\n\n\nI mean nobody will use tanks anymore\n\n\nUh everybody will be using missiles\n\n\nAt that time some emergent thing will happen which will make missiles uh kind of look old-fashioned\n\n\nWill we know what that is\n\n\nNo we won't know what that is\n\n\nSee the emergent culture emerges only when something is dominant\n\n\nYou can't predict the future that way\n\n\nThese things exist\n\n\nThey are not ideas, \n\n\nIt means that anything we have now is bound to disappear after you know so many years\n\n\nOf course in the past past in this century, uh things have occurred in a at a very fast pace\n\n\nI mean the changes are so fast that we can actually see something that is just emergent becoming dominant\n\n\nA good example is the typewriter\n\n\nI mean all of us oh well maybe not you but I can remember the days when everything was manual, \n\n\nBut now everything is electric\n\n\nAt that time the electric typewriter was really an emergent form and I remember that you remember the days when there were no computers\n\n\nThat 's only about ten years ago\n\n\nThe the word word processing started only in the eighties\n\n\nSo ten years ago\n\n\nNineteen-eighty there were no such things as word processors\n\n\nSo clearly we all remember the days when uh that was not emergent, \n\n\nWhat that means what this particular model means is that when the word processors become the dominant uh tool that is used by secretaries there will be something else, that will be used that will be developed\n\n\nAlright\n\n\nHow about uh Betamax sets\n\n\nThe V T R machine Malou\n\n\nMalou is not here\n\n\nNo uh uh yeah Christine", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nChapter thirteen which is uh the chapter the uh we 're trying to find out whether the principal teachings of Christianity starting with uh creation which we finished last meeting and salvation which we also finished right\n\n\nUh now we come to the question or teaching on the kingdom of God\n\n\nAnd eventually uh no no ahead of that we will have the question of sin love and sin\n\n\nAlright now let 's go first to love because that 's actually the uh ahead of the kingdom of God\n\n\nWe have already defined uh the love we are talking about is wishing and doing sometimes not doing what is really good for another for the beloved okay\n\n\nAnd we said also that loving is not in the heart but it is in the in the will huh which in psychology you will call our affective part affective faculty affective with love  'no  that 's the will while that which pertains to the mind or to the intellect uh we call it\n\n\nYou don't remember\n\n\nCognitive cognitive for knowing\n\n\nOkay so you have cognitive\n\n\nThis corresponds to what we call here as intellect and we have here what we call the will\n\n\nAnd both of them are aspects of what we call rationality\n\n\nYour being rational means you have intellect\n\n\nYou have a will\n\n\nThe will for loving intellect for knowing okay and the all the physical organs including the heart they simply manifest uh what we have in our uh mind or what we call intellect or will\n\n<$B> \n\nSir question\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nSir how come sometimes like when you don't want or how do you explain uhm people who want to fall out of love yet they can't help but still be in love with the person\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uh fall out of love and you 're still in love\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nIn the first place   Christianity tells  us we should love everybody\n\n<$B> \n\n They 're emotionally attached   \n\n<$A> \n\nYou should love me  \n\n\nThat is what Christ said\n\n\nAnd I should love all of you\n\n\nBut you see this is love has different degrees you know\n\n\nSo here you have a zero you have one hundred degrees\n\n\nYou love your boyfriend or girlfriend almost boiling point right  \n\n\nUh you love all men\n\n\nThat is a command of God uh\n\n\nLove everyone including your enemies\n\n\nRight\n\n\nNow where will you locate them\n\n\nThis is the area of love\n\n\nSomewhere here is the area of non-love huh no love no love huh\n\n\nYou may say hate or whatever huh no love\n\n\nUh there is by the way a an area where you are neither hot nor cold   uh  \n\n<$B> \n\n Indifferent   \n\n<$A> \n\nIndifferent\n\n\nAnd what does the Psalm say  because you are neither hot nor cold I will vomit you out of my mouth  you know\n\n\nA symbolic way of saying if you are indifferent you 're out  'no  \n\n\nSo uh all men should be located in this uh scale  right\n\n\nOur definition of love by the way fits your sweetheart and fits your parents fits your friends\n\n\nIt 's the wishing and doing sometimes not doing what 's good for another, right\n\n\nSometimes not doing, uh or something something huh\n\n\nNow you have to do what 's good you know\n\n\nYou know to do what 's good\n\n\nUh but is love always doing\n\n\nNot necessarily  'no  \n\n\nLove is not always doing\n\n\nUhm I know what your difficulty there\n\n\nYou are connecting not doing with what is good right\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nYou put you place it in  ano  in the context there is uh always doing something is not necessarily a sign of love\n\n\nAlways doing something for another is not necessarily uh a sign of love\n\n\nFor example okay uh you said you love me and you will uh uh do things for me okay\n\n\nUh let 's go to bed\n\n\nOh no no things like that right\n\n\nYou 're not doing you 're not\n\n\nYou are abstaining from uh anything you know\n\n\nSo so there are cases where you will not have to do it\n\n\nWhat we are trying to uh emphasize also is that love is not just wishing\n\n\nThey said hell is full of people who were always wishing to do good but they never actually did good\n\n\nAny student in La Salle always wishes to get to study harder but not everybody actually studies harder not all those who are wishing would be studying harder okay\n\n\nSo uh this is where uh we are supposed to put all people\n\n\nWe have to love them huh we have to love them\n\n\nAnd the real challenge of Christianity is that we also love those people who we should be hating, right\n\n\n Love your enemies  \n\n\nAnd it is very difficult\n\n\nBut unless we forgive we will not be forgiven\n\n\nAnd there are many things there in the Bible which tells you that\n\n\nAnd there are people who have actually uh done it\n\n\nThe classical example of a very recent saint Saint Maria Goretti huh who was uh stabbed because she was resisting rape\n\n\nAnd uh when she was dying uh the priest was called and the the first thing asked her is do you forgive your killer you know the one who stabbed you\n\n\nBecause if she doesn't forgive neither will the priest give absolution\n\n\n Hindi puwede  \n\n\nAs Christ says you must forgive one another if you want to be forgiven by God\n\n\nNow when you forgive that 's already a sign of love right\n\n\nSign of love\n\n\nIncidentally that man became the chief witness uh for the uh beatification and eventual canonization of Saint Maria Goretti\n\n\nHe repented while in prison\n\n\nHe never got married\n\n\nAnd uh eventually uh asked to be a gardener in a monastery\n\n\nSo the rest of his life was spent uh\n\n\nIt was like the second part of the life of Mary Magdalene right\n\n\nSecond part of Mary Magdalene okay\n\n\nSo uh love\n\n\nWe have been talking about love love love\n\n\nNow what about sin  'no  \n\n\nSome of us think that sin is so far away  'no  \n\n\nSin is only for priests or talk about sin when you take religion\n\n\nBut you see all these practices that are committed in our society for example kidnapping for ransom uh cheating on people with whom you uh sell things for example uh cheating in the construction business where you put inferior quality of wire and then sooner or later the house burns down due to faulty electrical wiring and all of these forms of cheating are considered sins right\n\n\nSo what is this\n\n\nUh sin in the old \" Our Father \" is known as a trespass right\n\n\nAnd a trespass means violation\n\n\nViolation of what violation of the law\n\n\nViolation of the law of what\n\n\nOf love\n\n\nLove of what\n\n\nOf God of fellowmen  \n\n\nSo that 's  ano  that 's the definition\n\n\nVery simple\n\n\nAnything that violates love true love okay is sinful, \n\n\nSo you disrespect your  if you love your parents you respect them right\n\n\nWhen you disrespect them it 's a violation of love, \n\n\nSo we have that\n\n\nNow there are two theories that are rejected with regard to sin\n\n\nSome people say sin is, merely, subjective\n\n\nIt 's all in the mind huh it 's all in the mind\n\n\nThere is really nothing sinful\n\n\nIt 's all in the mind\n\n\nThere is no fault of such thing as pornographic it 's all in the mind you know\n\n\nThere is nothing as a lewd dance it 's all in the mind  'no  \n\n\nLambada oh okay it 's all in the mind whatever it is  'no  \n\n\nUh I steal your car\n\n\nYou accuse me of having uh committed uh a sin\n\n\nNo\n\n\nYou see it 's all in the mind you know\n\n\nFor me it 's good  'no  \n\n\nI never do something which I think is bad\n\n\nI always do something which I think is uh good\n\n\nSo the rapist thinks that what he 's doing is good\n\n\nSo why punish him for doing what he thinks is good if you believe in this thing that wrongdoing is all in the mind you know\n\n\nThe other one is an error of thinking that it is uh objective huh\n\n\nObjective and nothing subjective\n\n\nIn other words you have the objective norm of morality with its corresponding uh punishment for violation\n\n\nSo for example when you kill a man under the law that man must be punished either by capital punishment which is death or maybe by life imprisonment or number of years in jail or by firing squad or whatever\n\n\nAlright\n\n\nYou agree that that is the law\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nSuppose your five-year-old uh brother while at home with your mother finds the gun of your father\n\n\nIt 's loaded\n\n\nSo he gets it goes to your mother who is cooking in the kitchen and then you know he has seen many things in uh T V you know shooting playing around\n\n\nThen he shoots your mother\n\n\nAnd your mother is killed\n\n\nWill you now say hey little boy you are guilty of matricide killing of one 's mother\n\n\nNow you will be brought to court and condemned to death electric chair \n\n\nWill you do that\n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause in judging the guilt of that person you just don't take the law like that\n\n\nYou have to consider the subjective condition of the person, right\n\n\nSome years ago there was a beautiful woman I don't know who she is who was found walking near the old International Airport totally naked\n\n\nUnder the law that is what do you call that public scandal\n\n\nShe could be charged of public scandal\n\n\nIn photography overexposure  \n\n\nBut you see it so happened that it seems that lady is a little bit out of her mind\n\n\nSo you can't put her to court and imprison her for uh what is that indecency or public scandal\n\n\nSo where do you bring her\n\n\nYou bring her to the mental hospital have her treated see\n\n\nSo what does this show\n\n\nIt shows that in sin there is uh sin implies an objective element which in other words is the norm of behavior and a subjective element\n\n\nFor example knowledge, consent\n\n\nThat is why if you remember your catechism oh what makes a mortal sin what causes a boy to commit a mortal sin\n\n\nThose of you who learned your Baltimore catechism I think you learned your catechism under Vatican two already\n\n\nBut before Vatican two we would memorize and try to understand the so called Baltimore catechism\n\n\nOh what constitutes a mortal sin\n\n\nVery serious matter full knowledge full consent okay\n\n\nFull knowledge full consent\n\n\nThe little boy that the in the example I gave you has no full knowledge he doesn't know what he 's doing because he 's not yet in full use of reason, \n\n\nAnd the uh young lady I told you about a while ago has no full use of his reason\n\n\nHe 's out of his mind okay\n\n\nAnd so although there is an objective norm violated the two examples I gave you are not guilty of any sin okay\n\n\nBecause uh they don't have this, clear enough\n\n\nThe moral norm is different from the uh uh what do you call this\n\n\nUh legal civil law where you say  ignorance of the law excuses no one  right\n\n\n Ignorance of the law excuses no one  \n\n\nIn uh moral theology eh true ignorance excuses you from moral responsibility\n\n\nFor example uh if you know or you think it is Monday huh suppose you are in uh the mountain area you have lost track of the of the uh days\n\n\nYou have no calendar there for example\n\n\nAnd you think it is Sunday\n\n\nAnd yet you treat that as though it were Monday then uh let 's see\n\n\nActually it is Monday but you think it is Sunday\n\n\nIf you work are you guilty of violating the Sabbath rest or Sunday rest\n\n\nNo huh\n\n\nIf you think it is if it is uh Sunday it 's actually Sunday but you thought it was Monday and you work you don't violate\n\n\nIf it is Monday and you think it is Sunday and you  you observe the Sunday rest then okay alright okay\n\n\nSo it must be true ignorance not feigned ignorance\n\n<$B> \n\nEven if it 's\n\n<$A> \n\nYou have tried to verify and there 's no way of verifying the what 's the true day okay then you have to depend on your conscience\n\n<$B> \n\nSir does it come with a responsibility that you should be responsible enough to\n\n<$A> \n\nYes but there are times when uh you err because as they say  to err is human  right\n\n\nSo there are times when you are in a position where it is impossible to get the correct information okay\n\n\nAlright so uh this is uh the meaning of sin and it is not something that is out of this world\n\n\nNo\n\n\nAll these things you read in the newspaper are sinful acts\n\n\nSinful acts <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nUh one thing I 'll tell you this the more love goes up  'no  and let 's say non-love huh uh non-love will naturally go down\n\n\nUh non-love will entail a for example you know indifference uh, \n\n\nAnd they have an effect on progress or development even physical progress\n\n\nNot just your uh progress in the non-physical area\n\n\nFor example I 'll give you this progress or development in a non-physical area\n\n\nSuppose uh at home all the members of the family they love each other okay\n\n\nPlenty of love there\n\n\nThen one day you go home and then say wow I got sixty in our test in CODEVEL you know, \n\n\nAnd if your brothers and sisters say okay we know you can get higher try again next time you know and so on and so forth\n\n\nPerhaps your spirit goes up and you resolve to study harder\n\n\nBut suppose your brothers and sisters say yeah  buti nga tanga ka e    wala  you know\n\n\nYou see that will not put you up right\n\n\nSo the same is true with this\n\n\nFor example respect all other 's property\n\n\nIs it here or here\n\n\nWhere, you respect other 's property, is it here or here\n\n\nIt 's here\n\n\nIf you respect other 's property there will be no hold-ups\n\n\nThere will be no robberies\n\n\nThere will be no stealing", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

first\n\n\nAlright now we will take up the \" Caucasian Chalk Circle \" which I expected everybody to read to have read\n\n\nI 'd like to sort of go back and trace the development of uh the drama so that you would understand more or less what uh, Bertolt Brecht, sort of uh innovated if you call it uh innovation  'no  of what he did\n\n\nAnd I hope you remember what you have seen\n\n\nLike for instance the Japanese play the  Noh  play the film that you saw and the  Kabuki  because I will be referring to this\n\n\nI 'll also be talking about the Chinese drama traditional Chinese drama which is called in the West the Peking Opera, okay\n\n\nAlright, if you remember in the Greek theater, when we were talking about the Greek theater some very interesting aspects in uh the script especially that of  \" Oedipus Rex \", \n\n\nYou find two characters at uh a time on stage talking about the problems the problems uh <unclear> word </unclear> you create are associated with uh what the gods had uh, decreed\n\n\nIn the case of Oedipus Rex it was a matter of uh defining fate\n\n\nYou know the role of fate in the in the life of Oedipus\n\n\nThe one interesting thing about the Greek theater is that it had a chorus\n\n\nAnd the function of the chorus was not just to speak out on the apparent uh thoughts of the character what was going on in his mind but also the Greek chorus tried to tell us about what happened in the past so that we would fill the gaps there in your knowledge of the plot\n\n\nSo that 's the Greek Greek theater\n\n\nAlso we noticed that in the presentation of the plays in the amphitheater in Greece they had not much of what we would consider today as necessary on a realistic stage\n\n\nThe backdrop the scenery the effort to make everything illusionary\n\n\nThere was no attempt at that in the Greek drama  \n\n\nNotice that the language used was exalted language\n\n\nPoetry was used\n\n\nRight\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nAnd the characters who participated or the characters the characters of the stories were noble characters noble characters mostly uh rulers kings queens and what happened to them\n\n\nSo that the fall of these characters the tragedy would really create an interesting impact that of pity and fear and eventually of course this would produce catharsis\n\n\nI think we defined that  'no  in tragedy\n\n\nNow, that was classical tragedy\n\n\nThen Elizabethan tragedy which we took up also showed something else, \n\n\nThe tragic flaw in the character consisted in the excess of the virtues possessed by the principal character\n\n\nAnd uh again we have uh noble characters\n\n\nWe have exalted language\n\n\nPoetic form\n\n\nHardly is there a Shakespearean play that has prose\n\n\nUh the prose parts if there are any are usually spoken by the fools by the jesters\n\n\nThere is always that nobility that is  exuded even in the dialogues, \n\n\nAnd then after that came the Romantic plays the Romantic plays\n\n\nOf course, again uh portrayed uh things that were fantastic, fantastic stories fantastic  happenings\n\n\nThen came the period of realism\n\n\nI think we talked about this\n\n\nAmong the first dramatists you might say involved in realism realistic plays were Ibsen and Hauptmann  \n\n\nOkay Ibsen you know very well as the author of\n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay \" The Enemy of the People \" \n\n\nWhat else did he write \n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\n\" Doll 's House \" and \" Hedda Gabler \" and\n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay you remember what it was uh <unclear> words </unclear> made this realistic\n\n\nWhat characteristic\n\n\nUh what characteristics did his plays have that weren't found in the earlier plays\n\n\nWhat kind of uh heroes did uh did Ibsen have\n\n\nOrdinary the common man  'no  \n\n\nOkay the common man and uh well in the case of Ibsen there was a principal character\n\n\nThere was a a tragic hero but not in the sense that the tragic hero in in the classical way the classical or Elizabethan manner, \n\n\nBut still tragic, \n\n\nThis is now the common man\n\n\nAnd uh with Hauptmann in \" The Weavers \" you have another kind of hero\n\n\nIt 's not just an individual but a group\n\n\nSo we have now the collective character the collective hero\n\n\nThe masses the masses\n\n\nNow realism was shown of course in the presentation of some uh almost true-to-life occurrences problems that we would also meet in our lives and we could relate to and the attempt at, illusion in the theater was done\n\n\nNow what is it\n\n\nUhm you were made to accept everything as if they were all happening uh in the the image of uh a of somebody going to the theater and uh waiting for the lights to, to dim and then the curtains opening and what did you find there\n\n\nYou find a uh a scene that is almost like what you would ordinarily find in actual life\n\n\nComplete  'no  \n\n\nSo that you you accept this as a a different world altogether and you are transported into that world you accept that world as if it were uh really there as if you were there in that world\n\n\nAnd this is brought about by scenery <unclear> word </unclear> with the idea of course of the fourth wall\n\n\nUh you know what what this is in the drama the fourth wall\n\n\nYou have let 's say this is the stage uh this this is the fourth wall\n\n\nBut it 's as if you as spectator here you are watching what 's happening inside a room with this wall removed this fourth wall removed\n\n\nSo everything here has to be has to be uh has to look like the real thing\n\n\nIf it is a let us just say let 's say it 's a living room it has to be complete with the living room furniture so that you are you agree to be deceived as it were\n\n\nYou enter into some kind of an agreement with the director with the actor with the playwright that you are going to accept this as true\n\n\nAnd so for a while when you 're watching the play you are transported into that world transported into that world\n\n\nYou are a spectator separated from that world as it were by this uh proscenium here by the apron here of the stage and so you 're watching\n\n\nYou 're just watching\n\n\nYou 're not participating, alright\n\n\nYou are there you empathize with the characters you 're one with the character characters on stage\n\n\nAnd you go through the emotions that the character also goes through\n\n\nThe same idea as with uh with the earlier kinds of play\n\n\nNow what happened later\n\n\nWhat did Bertolt Brecht introduce that was to depart from this realism, \n\n\nPost-realistic plays\n\n\nWell first let 's go back to realism\n\n\nWe were talking about Ibsen 's uh social realism\n\n\nThere was also psychological realism the probing into the motivations of the characters and uh this was of course uh uh spurred by scientific uh, experiments scientific advances at this time Freud and Jung Carl Jung were the ones who were uh often uh referred to\n\n\nTheir their probings into uh this psychological make-up of individuals became the uh basis for the very realistic portrayals of the characters\n\n\nOne such play is \" Miss Julie \" by uh Strindberg  'no  \n\n\n\" Miss Julie \" probes into the motivations of some, a young girl and uh why she attempts uh to take her life towards the end of the play\n\n\nThat 's psychological realism\n\n\nSocial realism of course presents a social problem\n\n\nNow you saw that in \" Enemy of the People \" and you saw how it was <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n\nBut there were rebellions against uh too much of this realistic illusionary theater or what we would call realism\n\n\nUhm there were attempts to present what we would call a presentational way of a presentational theater\n\n\nThese are all representational\n\n\nUhm such an attempt we found in  \" Arta \"   \" Arta \"  okay\n\n\nAnd also in the staging of uh in the staging of uh \" Death of a Salesman \" \" Death of a Salesman \" \n\n\nWhile there is still there uh the there is still the probing into the psyche of the individual uh you see that there is an easy switch from an easy switch from past and present and back to, to the uh, past and then to the present again  'no  \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nUhm another rebellion you might say which could be considered a core of expressionism would be the Brechtian theater uh the  the Brechtian play  'no  \n\n\nBertolt Brecht was Marxist\n\n\nBertolt Brecht was a Marxist\n\n\nSo when you look at his plays and the manner of presentation you are aware of the social commentary that he puts in there\n\n\nBut Brecht 's theater which is often referred to as the epic theater has been influenced by a lot of things\n\n\nAmong them of course the Greek play where you find the chorus included in the epic theater the Elizabethan uh conventions of well the lack of sets\n\n\nYou know in the Elizabethan theater we pointed out there were no sets really\n\n\nCharacters talk about the moon and so you know that it 's supposed to be night\n\n\nThere is no moon painted on some kind of canvas background\n\n\nOne character would come to the front with a spotted uh crane and that would stand for the Arden Forest\n\n\nAnd the lights were not dimmed nor brightened to show a change in uh in hours uh brightened to make it look like it 's daylight or dimmed in order to make it look like it 's night\n\n\nSo that 's that 's not done at all in the Elizabethan theater\n\n\nEverything is presented in in a bright light\n\n\nNow Bertolt Brecht borrowed these conventions and he borrowed also from the uh Japanese and the Chinese way of uh presenting their stories their dramatic presentations\n\n\nUh those of you who watched the  Noh  theater the  Noh  play did you notice how the characters came on stage, \n\n\nWhere did they come from, \n\n\nYou watched  \n\n\nOkay uh the characters would come from the dressing room which is connected by a bridge to the main stage, \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nAnd even as the characters would  \n\n\nOne character at a time\n\n\nEven as the character moved from the dressing room to the stage you know that he 'd be speaking his line\n\n\nBut very very slowly okay\n\n\nSlow motion\n\n\nVery slowly and he would move very very slowly uh and then he would say I am so and so \n\n\nHe would introduce himself\n\n\nIn other words he would be speaking directly now to the audience\n\n\nIn the realistic theater the actors and the actresses would really uh speak among themselves only\n\n\nThey would be oblivious of the fact that there is an audience watching them\n\n\nThey would be in a different world altogether\n\n\nEach one is supposed to internalize his role so that he can act out as uh expected\n\n\nBut in the Brecht theater Brechtian theater there is that direct address to the audience so that the audience is participatory\n\n\nNot just a spectator audience  iba na  it 's an observer audience\n\n\nAnd you find that in the and you find that in the  Noh  the Japanese theater and in the Chinese theater  'no  \n\n\nIn the Beijing Opera or Peking Opera that also happens\n\n\nThe character would come on stage and would say I am so and so from, from that part of China and I have traveled or I am going to travel three miles towards this city \n\n\nAnd then he walks on stage\n\n\nHe circles he makes a he goes around the stage three times or on the stage three times and then he would stop at a certain point and he would say I have arrived at the city \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nSo this this would show that he has traveled three days\n\n\nYes Steph  \n\n\nOkay so, there 's that direct address as I said to the audience and also uh a lot of telescoping also of events this traveling for instance is supposed to be done uh symbolically or it 's just suggested\n\n\nThere 's symbolism there\n\n\nUhm and then there 's a lot of mime\n\n\nBeijing Opera does a lot of uh mime miming \n\n\nAnd the Chinese actors are very good at this, even in having to step over a stile to enter a house when there is nothing there\n\n\nThey they they do that very well\n\n\nOpening windows\n\n\nSo mime is there, \n\n\nAnd what did Brecht do\n\n\nWhen he evolved that kind of theater he had stories presented but uh included they were not told chronologically they were they were not told realistically but he involved he involved uh chorus choruses what else\n\n\nHe involved uh mime\n\n\nHe involved acrobatics, \n\n\nThe dressing was done right there on stage\n\n\nSo there was no need for going backstage to change costumes\n\n\nThat that was done in many uh Brechtian plays\n\n\nAll they had to do was turn around and remove the costume and there would be the other thing underneath uh the other the next the costume needed for the next scene would be there underneath\n\n\nAnd that would remind you of what they do also in the Japanese theater\n\n\nThey did that in the  Kabuki  right\n\n\nAnd in the  Noh  theater they did that also okay\n\n\nUhm what else did he introduce\n\n\nHe introduced music\n\n\nUh this would be part of the play itself\n\n\nThe the songs were chanted or were sung and there were usually ballads which he adapted and he did not require actors with good singing voices", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "cc83b7ad-a7c2-4722-8806-c2a1fc760e2d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.072902+00:00"}

on religion let us go back to chapter nine that aspect on bureaucracy\n\n\nAnd take a look at what that is so that we can by the way because somebody 's taping the session you don't have a

it\n\n\nSo what do we mean by \" bureaucracy \" \n\n\nWhat do we mean by \" bureaucracy \" \n\n\nDon't you have anything to say about \" bureaucracy \" \n\n\nWhat what do you know about \" bureaucracy \" \n\n\nAnna\n\n<$C> \n\nA hierarchy of of jobs or tasks\n\n<$A> \n\nNow from your understanding from your familiarity with the term what does \" bureaucracy \" in a sense uh uh make you think

\" bureaucracy \" \n\n\nFrom your own familiarity with the term\n\n\nYou don't you 've met the word \" bureaucracy \" okay so that brings to mind uh implies \" red tape \" \n\n\nAnother Wilson\n\n<$I> \n\nUhm \" bureaucracy \" is a system uh if an in an organization which is supposed to make a process more efficient but in many cases it makes it even more inefficient\n\n<$A> \n\n\" Bureaucracy \" you say is a system\n\n\nOkay what is in that system\n\n\nRamon\n\n<$J> \n\nSystem of checks and balances\n\n<$A> \n\nWell let 's say uh you 're talking about the system here\n\n\nPresence of procedures you 're referring to the existence of rules regulations uhm\n\n\nWhat else\n\n\nLet 's take a look at what \" bureaucracy \" is really\n\n\nIt is defined as what\n\n\nIt refers to  okay\n\n\nIt talks about a particular system but that system refers to a hierarchy\n\n\nOf what\n\n\nA hierarchy of positions, in a large usually when we talk about large organizations this is a secondary group setting  'no  \n\n\nA large organization which makes possible, \n\n\nWhat, \n\n<$K> \n\nThe performance uh the performance of certain tasks\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay which makes it possible for the institution or the organization to perform its tasks and functions\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nSo look, it refers to that hierarchy\n\n\nAnd by hierarchy you 're thinking about what\n\n\nWhat comes to mind\n\n\nWhat does the word brings to mind  \n\n\nPyramidal\n\n\nThat means what\n\n\nDoes it always have to be pyramidal\n\n\nIt brings to mind layers\n\n\nIt brings to mind what\n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nLevels more appropriately ranking  di ba  \n\n\n May mataas may mababa  \n\n\nSo ranking\n\n\nThere are people at the top and people at the bottom\n\n\nExcuse me we have to end this  \n\n\nWhat transpired before you because we will use that to discuss when we talk about politics and education\n\n\nOkay so let 's go back to what we were discussing\n\n\nUhm when you when you talk about bureaucracy you 're actually referring to what\n\n\nA hierarchy of positions in a large secondary organization which makes sure that the tasks and function of that organization are accomplished\n\n\nOkay now when you talk about hierarchy you imply ranking\n\n\nThere are people at the top all the way down to the bottom and all these people are necessary to make this organization run or function\n\n\nNow uh that is why uh I suppose it will be very easy for you now to connect the existence of a hierarchy the presence of what\n\n\nDifferent kinds of people running the organization and the necessity for procedures rules and regulations to make the entire organization run smoothly\n\n\nAs a result of this need the presence of the hierarchy uh to ensure that the organization runs smoothly you may encounter certain problems\n\n\nThat 's why one of the problems you have encountered is what we call \" red tape \" \n\n\nIsn't that uh uh a fact that if you have a large the larger the organization what have you learned\n\n\nThe larger the organization, the\n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nOf course the more complex, the more important it is to make sure that each member of that organization knows what he or she is supposed to do\n\n\nIsn't that right\n\n\nOkay so therefore you must have what\n\n\nSystems, systems\n\n\nYou must install systems so that this organization will be able to operate smoothly, efficiently, effectively\n\n\nIf it 's an organization that is uh what\n\n\nWhose goal is to, deliver services, \n\n\nThe services have to be, \n\n\nWhat is the test of the performance of the organization the, what\n\n\nThe results or the  \n\n<$?> \n Performance\n\n<$A> \n\nThat services are actually delivered to communities that it 's supposed to serve\n\n\nHow do you do that\n\n\nIf you do not ensure a smooth flow of operations so they would like to be efficient they would like to be effective so you they set up what\n\n\nSystems\n\n\nSystems of procedures okay\n\n\nSystems involving procedures involving rules how to how to\n\n\nNow when they do that what happens is  it 's really for this purpose\n\n\nThe objectives are noble  di ba  \n\n\nThey want to deliver in that that example that we presented\n\n\nLet 's say the what I mean  ano  a department a government uh uh agency Department of Transportation for example or a department for social services  'no  \n\n\nSo what happens is they want to deliver\n\n\nThey want to perform well so they want to deliver what they 're supposed to deliver\n\n\nNow uhm, in the interest of performing well what happens is they become  uhm inflexible\n\n\nYou have set up systems and procedures right\n\n\nNow people follow that to the letter\n\n\nSo what happens is you have inflexibility okay\n\n\nAnd what happens is because this is a large organization with a lot of people with a lot of functions what happens is the procedures become long-winded right\n\n\nThat 's why you are referring to \" red tape \" \n\n\n Parang matagal bago magawa ang isang bagay  \n\n\nTake a look at something you are following up uh what we call \" paper-chase \" in government\n\n\nNot only government\n\n\nEducational systems all of the other institutions from religion\n\n\nSo you have next education the economy and the political institutions\n\n\nAll of these are what, \n\n\nLarge organizations or involves excuse me all of them involve large organizations which tend to become if they are not already, what\n\n\nBureaucracies\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nSo all of them would have problems like this\n\n\nProblems of wanting to perform well and as a result, encountering other problems like inflexibility\n\n\nSo they 're so inflexible such that what do we what do we see in in in the case of processing papers\n\n\nIf the a certain person it 's like if this is your  piece of paper and the routes for this paper is from person A to B to C to D before it goes out again to you\n\n\n Di ba  okay\n\n\nSo \" paper in paper out \" \n\n\nWhat are the stages or the routes that are taken by this paper\n\n\nA person A B C D what happens\n\n\nWhat happens in actual situation\n\n\nThese these are only four people usual or these these might be four persons or four offices or four units or four departments okay\n\n\nNow what happens\n\n\nIf there are departments to go to it would be more awful because there are people in the departments who take charge of that\n\n\nThere are two or three persons in a department in a unit uh who have to take charge of that\n\n\nWhat is going to happen to the process\n\n\nIt will be lengthier longer right\n\n\n Kaya sinasabi natin  red tape  di ba  okay\n\n\nNow what happens when when this piece of paper goes to A and if let us say A is not there\n\n<$?> \n The whole system is held up\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay \n\n\nThe whole the processing is held up or delayed\n\n\nSo you have to wait for A\n\n\nAnd sometimes the inflexibility can be carried to such an extent that nobody else takes the place of A\n\n\nSo if A is on vacation for two weeks you 'll have to return maybe two weeks uh you 'll have to give two weeks more to the processing\n\n\nIf it will take a matter of one week for \" paper in \" to \" paper out \" \n\n\nWhat happens\n\n\nA will have to be out for two weeks and the the paper cannot move from A to B because A is absent so you 'll have to be to add one week of processing plus two weeks of absence by A so you have to have three weeks\n\n\nSo it 's longer\n\n\nIt takes longer\n\n\nNow why does this happen\n\n\nBecause you have what\n\n\nVery clear-cut procedures\n\n\nOnly A can sign\n\n\nSomething like that\n\n\nWhat is that for\n\n\nPerhaps it is to meet another objective of the organization which is to make sure that things are done in proper\n\n<$?> \n Order\n\n<$A> \n\nOrder\n\n\nProper systems\n\n\nSo you have a system of check and balance\n\n\n Hindi puwede na hindi dumaan dito  for some kind of, what\n\n\nApproval, sanction okay\n\n\nSo you have uh a very long-winded process resulting from this particular instance\n\n\nSo we talk about what\n\n\nIn the bureaucracy you have red tapes\n\n\nIn the bureaucracy the bureaucracy becomes so inflexible, okay\n\n\nIf the person is not there nobody else can take his place\n\n\nSo the system gets derailed or gets delayed is held up okay\n\n\nNow isn't that what we experienced\n\n\nTake a look\n\n\nWhy why do we say that this is true even in religion\n\n\nTake a look at our Catholic Church which is one big what\n\n<$?> \n Bureaucracy\n\n<$A> \n\nYes bureaucracy organization in the religious institution\n\n\nThere are many others\n\n\nI suppose every other church organization would qualify as a bureaucracy\n\n\nThe  Iglesia ni Kristo  is another big bureaucracy\n\n\nThe different Protestant churches would be bureaucracies in their own right  'no  \n\n\nSo take a look at positions even\n\n\nWhat did I say the other time\n\n\nDid I mention this about even in the in the heavens you have a hierarchy\n\n\nFrom the archangel down to the cherubs\n\n\nThe cherubims  'no  \n\n\nWith the head and then the <unclear> word </unclear> like that okay with the wings\n\n\nAnd then take a look at the Catholic Church from the Pope, down to the bishops archbishops all of them the priests down to the laity okay\n\n\nRight\n\n\nSo now take a look at educational institutions\n\n\nDe La Salle University\n\n\nIsn't the situation the same\n\n\nYou have what\n\n\nThe President   okay  \n\n<$?> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nAll the different vice  all the positions and down to what\n\n\nThe teachers the faculty down to the other personnel of the university down to your security guard\n\n\nAll of them occupying what\n\n\nDifferent ranks different positions\n\n\nThat is uh that 's supposed to guarantee that this organization is going to flow is going to run smoothly\n\n\nSo have haven't you tried uh to sample some red tapes during let 's say what\n\n\nWhat times, \n\n\nEnrolment\n\n\nRegistration  \n\n\nOkay now we move from educational system to what\n\n<$?> \n Government\n\n<$A> \n\nGovernment political organizations so you want to apply for a driver 's license at the L T O, okay\n\n\nNow that 's why you see what I am I would not want to rationalize I would never want to rationalize graft and corruption or bribery", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWhat we should do this morning is to just recap what we had\ndiscussed last meeting uhm, arrive at some form of synthesis as to the the\ninterests the leading interests of adolescents\n\n\nSo probably what I can do is add more to what we have shared\n\n\nWe had an interesting sharing last meeting about concerns and\ninterests of adolescents\n\n\nUhm and I think predominant in our sharing last time was uhm, \nwhat was it uhm boy-girl relationships\n\n\nThat particular area has been shared with, I mean shared about\nextensively as well as parental overprotectiveness as far as that area is\nconcerned\n\n\nNow it leads me to another interest another leading interest of\nadolescents which is self-direction and in that area okay in that area we\nhave expressed some of our major concerns\n\n\nFor example uhm let me just go through uhm some of the uhm\nexpressions of uh assertiveness of adolescents and uh I think uh one of the\nways by which we one of the forms by which we express that assertion is our\ndemand that we have privacy as far as males our males are concerned our\nprivate properties  are concerned our desire to be allowed\nto use the telephone and no extension no extension lines being opened when we\nare on the phone\n\n\nOkay we we assert this and this is part of our desire to be I mean\ndesire for self regulation\n\n\nOkay so if this is not respected by parents it can become an area of\ndispute a source of dispute alright\n\n\nOne other way by which I think this was shared last time one other\narea by which we  we express our assertiveness is in the choice of\nour, activities okay choice of our activities choice of companions choice\nof course vocation okay uh where we would like to go to school education\n\n\nAnd again if this is if this is uh, not respected by parents or\nif parents encroach on this it becomes a source of an area of irritant as far\nas uh parent-child relationships are concerned\n\n\nThis was mentioned last time\n\n\nOkay uh another area which I think you also experience but which\nwas not shared at all last time is the freedom to use your allowance the way\nyou want\n\n\nOkay is that still uh is that still uh what looked into by your\nparents\n\n\nDo they do they investigate how you use your allowance\n\n\nAt least that much I think many of you experience freedom greater\nfreedom to spend your allowance the way you want to\n\n\nAlright the wish for your own room okay  di ba  \n\n\nAnd then the desire to lock it when you want to and open it when\nyou want to  di ba  \n\n\nYes Rachel  \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so you 're saying that that 's a good a good way by which\nyou can establish or foster better relationships with siblings, \n\n\nAnd uh well uh of course not sharing it with parents and I think\nthat 's a uh sharing your room with parents at the adolescent stage is I\nthink out of the question\n\n\nIt 's unhealthy and uh you wouldn't want to do that  okay\n\n\nAlright one other way by which we we assert assert our our desire\nfor self-regulation is, uh yeah this was shared last time we feel very\nmuch distrusted if, we feel very much distrusted if they ask us where are\nyou going with whom are you going and uh where will you be going okay what\ntime are you coming back\n\n\nOkay uh in other words bottom-line the adolescent is saying trust\nme so that I can I can manage myself better\n\n\nIf you don't trust me then all the more probably I will foul up\n\n\nOkay so adolescence really is a time where we are most concerned\nabout managing ourselves and testing the grounds for self-regulation just a\nminute Teresa and if these are not allowed by parents then you have a rebel\nin your house\n\n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nJust like uhm rooming in <unclear> words </unclear>  sa\n\n family  namin  <unclear> words </unclear> Mom I have\nthis party to go to <unclear> 3 words </unclear> I 'm gonna wear this dress\n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nIncluding that\n\n<$B> \n\nOo  lahat  set out  lahat  \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\n O sige  \n\n<$A> \n\nAlright in other words you 're saying that uh if all the\ninformation all the data needed by your parents are already provided for or\nprovided by you then it makes uh it provides <unclear> 1 word </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nIt will assure you <unclear> words </unclear> still  \nnasa  <unclear> 1 word </unclear>  ka na  \n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> 1 word </unclear>  ka na  of  'no\n\n being given information\n\n\nOkay let us add some more input\n\n\nThese were the things shared last time  'no  \n\n\nLet us add some some other leading interests and concerns and maybe\nyou can check it out whether this really was a concern of yours\n\n\nUh primary and foremost is appearance isn't it\n\n\nOkay adolescents are very concerned about appearance because from\nexperience you know that it is a major factor in what in being accepted by\nothers\n\n\nSo there is this concern as to how you look uh body build skin\ncomplexion uh breath how you smell  okay isn't it\n\n\nUh also uh following latest fashion and style\n\n\nIn fact you know some some adolescents uh worry a lot about you\nknow being \" in \" \n\n\nYou see that adolescent culture can exert a lot of pressure on us\n\n\nDon't you experience that what to wear uh if I wear this I am I\nfeel I think I look  baduy  and I 'd rather not\n\n\nSo there are two there are two courses of action\n\n\nOne either one will withdraw or exert a lot of effort go go through\nuh a lot of uh maybe go out of your way to really be \" in \" \nas far as your crowd is concerned\n\n\nWhat else what are other concerns as far as appearance is concerned\n\n\nBody measurements I was talking about it\n\n\nLegs waist arms  di ba  if you 're tall or short or\nthings of that kind hair on the body you know\n\n\nSo, girls in particular go through a lot of inconvenience just\nso they will be good-looking okay\n\n\nOne case in point\n\n\nThose of you who wear braces  di ba  it 's such an\ninconvenient uh, what is that it 's such an inconvenient appurtenance you\nknow\n\n\nUh but I know of somebody who has been wearing braces for thirteen\nyears  \n\n<$A> \n\nThirteen thirteen\n\n<$C> \n\nMore than two years now\n\n<$A> \n\nWho has who wears braces here\n\n\nWho can tell us do you know that\n\n\nWho wears braces\n\n\n Dati wala na  \n\n\nUh Anna how was it\n\n<$D> \n\nThree years\n\n<$A> \n\nThree years  ano lang 'yon  corrective  \nlang ano  \n\n\nOkay Lovelyn, uh Giselle  \n\n\nHow many years\n\n<$E> \n\nThree and a half\n\n<$A> \n\nThree and a half\n\n\nWas it fun  okay that 's a case in point you know\nuh it 's you know you go out of your way to a lot through a lot of  \nnagsa  suffer I mean a lot of inconvenience so your teeth will look\nnice okay\n\n\nUh and also a lot of expense  very expensive\n\n\nBut but  but because you know there is a lot of premium\nattached to good looks\n\n\nUhm in other words one major obsession of adolescents is looks\n\n\nWhat about the guys what what are the what are the what are the\nconcerns of the guys as far as as far as appearance is concerned\n\n\nOh don't tell me Vic you are not interested in uh following fads\nand teenage what do you call that teenage fashion  \n\n\nYou did not think about it never thought of it with all your\nfriends  \n\n\n Ha  \n\n\nNothing out of the ordinary\n\n\nAnyway uh this this is a major area of concern and worry of\nadolescents\n\n\nYou want to look good you want to be accepted and you want to be\nyou want to be uhm have a nice appearance because it is at this time that the\nopposite sex is also another major area of interest\n\n\nAll right appearance I don't think there is any question about it\n\n\nAll of us have gone, I have gone through that you 're going\nthrough it and uh it is uh for me a an established fact\n\n\nNow second another area of interest\n\n\nCheck this out\n\n\nUhm creative self-expression\n\n\nDid you at one point write poems  \n\n\nYes no  \n\n\nUh going back now try to read your poems that you have written you\nknow how\n\n\nOkay poems uh letter writing uh  short story writing\nand uh well another another outlet for self expression is the diary uh the\ndiary\n\n\nNow, so, do you think this is a lot okay\n\n\nLet me put it this way\n\n\nA lot of creative work of adolescents, are mainly, attempts\nat self-expression emotional self-expression rather than sheer talent\n\n\nDo you agree do you agree\n\n\nAll of you did it  'no  all of you went through it\n\n\nNow do you think that you have talent  \n\n\nThere is the talent that really uh the real thing\n\n\nActually this is uhm our creative work our creative writings are of\ncourse indications of cognitive maturation okay\n\n\nThey are signals you know they are signs that we are going through\nthe cognitive maturation phase but at the same time it is serving us a very\nimportant function and that is emotional expression\n\n\nNow do you ever wonder uh you have a question there Rosa\n\n\nOkay do you ever wonder why you also talk a lot during this stage\nadolescence\n\n\nParticularly the early adolescence there is so much you know\ntalking you just you know when you see friends  parang  you\ncan't stop talking\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nThere is just so much to talk about\n\n\nWell again this is one form of expressing oneself\n\n\nWhen you talk on the phone it 's just endless and you know to the\ndismay of parents\n\n\nParents you know uh get very much irritated get very much uh uh\npissed you know by by burning telephone lines\n\n\nBut of course if you look at it from the perspective of emotional\nexpression you know developing conversational skills and the like which is a\nneed and interest of adolescents then perhaps parents can become more\nunderstanding about this\n\n\nNow uh do you also wonder why televiewing okay is a very important\noccupation preoccupation\n\n\nMovie going alright\n\n\nUh some did did some did you listen also to soap operas  okay okay soap operas\n\n\nNow what what is the function of this\n\n\nWell do do you know what the function of it watching television\nromantic stories  etcetera etcetera  <unclear> word\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$F> \n\nI recall watching soap operas <unclear> words </unclear> they\nare able to distinguish the good and bad side of it\n\n<$A> \n\nWell okay the good and bad side of it but you know we 're\ntalking of adolescents\n\n\nWhat is the what is the function performed or played by this uh by\nwatching television you know you like you like going to the movies\n\n\nIt 's a very important activity a primary activity in fact\n\n\nWhy, Ina\n\n\nDo you see what this is\n\n\nYou know do you know that this is also a form of ventilation for\nadolescents a form of ventilation\n\n\nWhen you see let 's say your problems being acted out here you\nknow by uh by by Sharon Cuneta by Sheryl Cruz and the like  \nor uh you know uh on television for example Manilyn Reynes on uh \" \nYoung Love Sweet Love \" \n\n\nYou know that is one form by one way by which you can express\nyourself emotionally\n\n\nWell it is not expression in the real sense of uh the term but it\nis one way of ventilating things that are already being experienced by the\nadolescent okay\n\n\nAll right uhm  \n\n\nOh vocation, choice of a course yes, this again is one very\nimportant interest and concern of the adolescent\n\n\nMaybe at this point you have made a decision already have you\n\n\nAre you settled in the course that you are in or you 're still\nentertaining second thoughts about continuing on in the course or wanting to\nshift to some other you know some other uh areas of specialization\n\n\nIt 's not uncommon though you know to hear of some some teenagers\nwho in their second year have not at this at that point decided on a course\n\n\nI have seen adolescents who move from one course to the other\n\n\nFortunately probably for you here in La Salle it 's not easy to\nshift okay it 's not easy\n\n\nThey don't make it easy for you but in some other universities you\nknow you can shift from one course to the other\n\n\nSo that many are in the university for several years without\nfinishing a course because they move from one they shift from one course to\nanother\n\n\nI know of some people who even in their third year fourth year are\nstill not happy about the course they landed in\n\n\nMainly probably because of the lack of intelligent decision-making\nprocess or lack of assistance you know in the in the uh decision-making\nprocess for a for a course  1", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e87c0ef4-bf0a-4179-80df-37aab27a84f5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.075602+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nWe start on the pretext that uh language testing practices uh have always emanated from language teaching practices\n\n\nIt 's the uh it 's usually the case that language testing has always followed language teaching traditions\n\n\nIt has never been the other way around\n\n\nIt 's not although Allan Davis in one of his articles once uh hinted that maybe the time uh should come when language testing should dictate language teaching trends\n\n\nI don't know when that would happen\n\n\nIt hasn't happened, \n\n\nAnyway we 'll start with uhm developments in language teaching or language education in general because it is those developments that have influenced uh proponents in language testing\n\n\nTo conceive the way they did they 've done\n\n\nSo to think of uh the one of the first notions of language uh the acquisition of language in that is that it 's structural\n\n\nSo we uh the first developments of linguistics is uh structuralism\n\n\nThe first considered uh considered to be the first school of linguistics among the first is uh the thought about the structuralism and growth of language\n\n\nMeaning to say that language is uh predominantly the concern with language is its form not so much on its meaning\n\n\nMeaning is there only as a crutch to the form that we understand as a form, \n\n\nUh the view is that language is a system of habits of communication\n\n\nAnd habits of communication consist of four linguistic layers the sound layer the phonology the morphological layer the word structure the syntactical layer the sentence structure and the lexical layer or lexicon or the vocabulary\n\n\nSo it is uh anyone who wishes to learn a language must concentrate on these four layers of language sequentially uh uh in sequence\n\n\nYou start out learning the sounds and then when you 're ready I mean you have acquired the sounds you 're ready for the next higher level which is the words word structure\n\n\nAnd when you 're ready for the word uh you have mastered the word structure then you can proceed to the sentence structures and so on\n\n\nSo you don't uh uh like the notion in descriptive linguistics where you 'd have to start out with the sound system\n\n\nThe written is only secondary and it 's the oral that is of  primary importance\n\n\nSo once you have acquired and have mastered what you 've heard then you 're ready to speak\n\n\nThat 's why uh uh in structuralism the language teaching methodology that predominated uhm which is based on structuralist view of language is the audio lingual method which is audio listen lingual speak\n\n\nSo listen first then speak\n\n\nThat 's why it 's called audio lingual or in other words, aural oral approach\n\n\nSo these two are they mean the same the uh the uh approach to the learning of language through the sound system first and then when you have uh mastered the sound system you 're ready to speak, then you 're ready to read and lastly to write\n\n\nThat is why with the audio lingual method they they emphasize on the neat sequence of L S R W  \n\n\nListen speak read and write\n\n\nNever alter the sequence\n\n\nWhen you teach a language you always have to discuss listening first then speaking then reading and writing, \n\n\nThen uhm of course there are other methods of teaching language that uh became known like \" suggestopedia \" like the \" total physical response approach \" \" the direct method \" \n\n\nOf course before everything a before the uh even \" the structural approach \" you have the uh the uh \" grammar translation approach \" \n\n\nWe learned it that way first in our time as uh young learners in school\n\n\nWe learned through the grammar translation approach first and then uh then I think when we were in the intermediate grades that was when the structure approach uh became prominent\n\n\nI mean as far as I am as far as I can remember we started to learn language through the grammar translation approach\n\n\nThen you had uh, what 's this\n\n\nThe silent way approach uhm, \n\n<$B> \n\nC L L\n\n<$C> \n\nCommunity Language Learning\n\n<$A> \n\nC L L yes community language learning\n\n<$C> \n\nNotional functional approach\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then the notional functional approach\n\n\nSo I think I emphasize that even though I say there are other methods that developed after the audio lingual method, or the aural oral uh approach\n\n\nThen in between we had  T P R we had suggestopedia we had C L L we had silent way direct method and whatever else\n\n\nThen prominent the next prominent kind of method of language teaching was the notional, functional approach  \n\n\nNow why why do we distinguish this from the previous what is the uh legacy of the notional functional approach in uh\n\n\nDoes anybody know\n\n<$B> \n\nMeaning\n\n<$A> \n\nMeaning\n\n\nHere we think of A L M as focusing on\n\n<$B> \n\nForm\n\n<$A> \n\nForm then\n\n<$B> \n\nMeaning\n\n<$A> \n\nMeaning is there only as uh an aid there to the understanding of form\n\n\nNow came the notional functional approach which emphasized\n\n<$B> \n\nMeaning\n\n<$A> \n\nMeaning\n\n\nUh in fact form was out of the question\n\n\nIf you recall uh during the era that uh concentrated on the notional functional approach they say it didn't matter how you speak that language\n\n\nIt didn't matter how you listen to the language what matters is whether you used you put across the message the meaning\n\n\nAnd and what matters is you understood what you 've heard or what you 've read\n\n\nNever mind grammar\n\n\nUh that was uh the uh, outstanding feature of the notional functional approach is that it concentrated too much on meaning to the neglect of grammar\n\n\nThat is why I remember that of uh the proponent of uh the notional functional approach was David Wilkins  \n\n\nThe notional functional approach is a British tradition and uh David Wilkins himself realized the shortcomings of the notional functional approach in that because of too much emphasis on meaning the  the result was uh poor grammar\n\n\nSo it that that was a bleak uh fate for grammar\n\n\nThat is why David Wilkins was among the first to because he realized the shortcoming of the notional functional approach he was the early proponent of communicative teaching\n\n\nSo together with this uh <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$C> \n\nWiddowson\n\n<$A> \n\nWiddowson they collaborated to uh, develop the communicative approach\n\n\nSo we can say that the notional functional approach is uh a springboard to the development of the communicative approach\n\n\nOf of course the communicative approach is so unlike also the the previous in that this one says form first than meaning \n\n\nMeaning first never mind form\n\n\nThen with the communicative approach  meaning first plus  form, right\n\n\nSo it is form then meaning meaning never mind form then meaning first then form \n\n\nSo you recall that uhm it was important to note functions of language\n\n\nFunctions they must have meaning I mean a message function\n\n\nHow do you function in language is not so much the understanding of form but more on the usage the use of form to function in language\n\n\nThat 's the thrust of the communicative approach\n\n\nIt 's not so much that you know so much in structure but whether you can perform the structure that you know, effectively\n\n\nSo function first is identified then the relevant grammar or language forms that go with every function will be identified\n\n\nIn in essence that 's the communicative approach\n\n\nIdentify the meaning first the function first and then identify the form that goes with the function\n\n\nCan you recall uhm John Oller who was one of the first uh linguists who said that uhm you recall Oller was a proponent of integrated testing integrated testing\n\n\nHe said uh, anyone can score ninety-five percent or even one hundred percent in a language or grammar test but that is no guarantee that that person who scored so high in a language test can ever function in a language can ever perform you know the extent that he knows of the form of language\n\n\nSo what was more important then I think that was the beginnings of the realization that what was more important was not knowledge of form but the ability to function with that knowledge of form\n\n\nSo Oller 's I think is pivotal\n\n\nOller 's view of a distinction between integrated  testing and  discrete point testing was pivotal\n\n\nMany people realize that\n\n\nReally if you think of it yeah someone can be very good at grammar someone can be very good at you know uh performing in written paper and pencil test but you cannot be  very sure that that person can really use the language\n\n\nSo in we use another uh nomenclature we say we need form use usage\n\n\nI recall Dell Hymes one of the early anthropological linguists who really exerted a lot of influence uh in the developments of social linguistics who said  there are rules of use without which rules of usage would be useless , \n\n\nSo I think I have said already in the in this the same class minus the two of you the two anecdotes that I 've had to really uh exemplify the importance of what Dell Hymes said\n\n\nUhm I recall a friend uh we we just graduated from teaching from P N U\n\n\nShe was assigned to her school in  Antipolo Rizal\n\n\nMy friend is a beauty\n\n\nAnd until now she 's still a beauty  \n\n\nThe American Peace Corps volunteer before he came to the Philippines had a crash course in Tagalog in Sacramento California\n\n\nSo he was really well-armed linguistically\n\n\nHe knew that uh the kind of Tagalog that he need he needed to uh get along with uh teachers in Antipolo Rizal\n\n\nNaturally when he that American Peace Corps volunteer first saw my friend he was attracted  kasi nga  beauty  eh  \n\n\nUh pardon me Lin uh Shaolin I said something in Tagalog okay\n\n\nSo he said can I visit you tonight \n\n\nOf course my friend was elated that he would be visited by an American she would be visited by an American \n\n\nSo anyway that night it was a, a celebration of sorts in the neighborhood\n\n\nBecause at that time it was a big thing to have an American for a suitor\n\n\nAnd you know in the provinces the houses are built such that you have a balcony, and the balcony is the place where suitors are entertained\n\n\nI think for the reason that  if anybody sees you there you cannot do hanky panky you cannot do some foolishness there \n\n\nSo they were there\n\n\nMy friend was entertaining the American Peace Corps volunteer in the balcony at the house\n\n\nNow  he came at seven o'clock, eight o'clock no move\n\n\nIn the provinces the rule is you visit only for an hour no less uh no more I mean no more\n\n<$D> \n\nGo home  \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then you go home  \n\n\nSo the American was not aware of this rule\n\n\nHe stayed on\n\n\nMy friend of course was aware of this rule but she was willing to violate the rule\n\n\nBecause she was enjoying the Peace Corps volunteer 's company\n\n\nNine o'clock came\n\n\nStill no move to leave\n\n\nThe two were enjoying themselves\n\n\nThe parents were getting uh,  panicky\n\n\nWhat would the neighbors say \n\n\nYou know why are we tolerating this \n\n\nBut of course my my friend 's parents did not know English\n\n\nAnd again even if they knew English in the provinces they are very timid they will not uh venture to they would not venture to be offensive to the guest\n\n\nAnyway so they were panicky inside\n\n\nMy friend and the the Peace Corps were enjoying themselves\n\n\nTen o'clock came still no move to leave\n\n\nAt that point really the my friend 's parents were really really uh very embarrassed\n\n\nWhat the neighbors would say\n\n\nEleven o'clock  no move to leave no move no move to leave at all\n\n\nAnd this of course the American did not have in his training\n\n\nHe wasn't trained for social meanings\n\n\nHe was trained only for linguistic meanings\n\n\nAnd so at when eleven o'clock came and still the American Peace Corps volunteer was not to leave uhm making move to leave my uh my my my friend 's parents started to do paralinguistic signs\n\n\nBecause they could not they didn't know English\n\n\nThey were again uh not very confident with what they the little English that they knew\n\n\nSo my one of them started to to close with a bang the window within view of the balcony with a bang\n\n\nNo effect  \n\n\nThe American did not know that  \n\n\nThen next they did was to roll a mat, in the  sala  again within view of the balcony\n\n\nNo effect\n\n\nThen they turned off the lights in the  sala  not not in the balcony yet\n\n\nStill no effect, \n\n<$C> \n\nYour friend was deliberately ignoring these\n\n<$A> \n\nShe was  she was willing to be reprimanded to be scolded later\n\n\nSo, uh I think that was the last straw\n\n\nThey were really exasperated, \n\n\nSo my my friend 's mother approached my friend\n\n\nIt was really uh too much already\n\n\nThey reached the point where they could no longer  tolerate the Peace Corps volunteer\n\n\nSo my friend 's mother went to her, and pinched  her ear one of the ears\n\n<$C> \n\nParalinguistic  pa rin 'yan  \n\n<$A> \n\n Oo  paralinguistic  pa rin 'yan  \n\n\nSo my friend said you better go now", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "02bcb8fc-af57-4dcc-83a3-607a5681bf2b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.076725+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nSo it is now appropriate for the weekend it is going now to be a weekend that you will be doing some more in statistics are you ready\n\n\nOkay take this down  the following data the following data are the ages the following data are the ages of a sample of twenty-five automobile sales people in the United States, and a sample of twenty-five automobile sales people in Western Europe , \n\n\nYou got it  'no  \n\n\nAlright let me repeat\n\n\n The following data are the ages of a sample of twenty-five automobile sales people in the United States and a sample of twenty-five automobile sales people in Western Europe  \n\n\nNow let me write the data on the board , \n\n\nThe different data that refer to the ages of drivers in the United States and in Western Europe\n\n\nOkay the requirements, you ready for the requirements\n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nAlright, finished class\n\n\nOkay now what you should be doing is you 're going to discuss the findings of the data that you have okay\n\n\nYou have the data representing the ages of uh sales people in the United States and in  in Western Europe\n\n\nSo you are going to display the data separately by a <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nSecond you have to calculate the mean the median the first quartile the third quartile the range the inter-quartile range and the coefficient of variation\n\n\nThese will be discussed today\n\n\nNumber three the shape of the distribution whether it is negatively skewed positively skewed\n\n\nAnd then number four discuss the findings\n\n\nHow do you discuss the findings\n\n\nYou are going to compare the uh the two data sets the ages of U S drivers versus the ages of Western Europe\n\n\nIs the homework clear\n\n\nAlright\n\n\nSo for today we are going to discuss the measures of variation because we finished measures of central tendency last Wednesday both for the uh grouped and the ungrouped data\n\n\nYou recall that\n\n\nWe calculated the mean the median  uh the mode for both grouped and ungrouped data okay\n\n\nNow tell me what 's the difference between grouped and ungrouped data\n\n\nWhat is the difference between grouped and ungrouped data\n\n\nSusan\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm grouped data are characterized by <unclear> words </unclear> like for example you have <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nAlright\n\n\nBy grouped data we mean data that are arranged into a what frequency distribution\n\n\nBy frequency distribution we arrange the data according to categories or classes and then we tally the number of variables or the number of values that would be included in that particular class okay\n\n\nSo now we said last Wednesday also that if we will only be dealing with measures of central tendency some problems may come up\n\n\nLike the problem on employee A and employee B wherein both have the same average uh performance but if you look at the variability of each value then you would know that one employee is better than the other employee\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause we looked at the uh dispersion or the spread of the scores from a point of reference called the mean\n\n\nThe point of reference class may not only be the mean\n\n\nIt could also be the median or the mode\n\n\nBut the usual procedure is to compare every value from the mean okay\n\n\nNow, let 's begin the measures of variation or variability\n\n\nAlright\n\n\nThe first and the simplest is the range\n\n\nHere\n\n\nAlright let me see\n\n\nI will add\n\n\nOh here is the range\n\n\nThe first measure of variability is the range\n\n\nIf you 're given a set of scores class immediately you calculate the range\n\n\nWhat is the range  \n\n\nHighest minus lowest very good\n\n\n X highest minus X lowest\n\n\nIt is the distance of the highest score from the lowest or vice versa\n\n\nHow far away is the highest from the lowest\n\n\nSo that if I have case A let us say this is one class the highest score here let us say is a hundred the lowest score is ninety-five\n\n\nOr let 's say ninety\n\n\nSo what is the range\n\n\nThe range is\n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nI have another case B\n\n\n The highest score is ten the lowest score is zero\n\n<$C> \n Ten\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat is the range\n\n\nThe range is also ten\n\n\nI have case C alright\n\n\nThe highest score is a hundred the lowest score is zero\n\n\nWhat is the range\n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nOne hundred okay\n\n\nNow, we have three groups of students here\n\n\nWe have three classes\n\n\nWe said the highest in case A is a hundred the lowest is ninety the range is ten\n\n\nIn case B the highest is ten the lowest is zero range is ten\n\n\nIn case C highest is a hundred lowest is zero the range is a hundred\n\n\nNow can you have a description of the abilities of the classes here\n\n\nYes Manuel describe to me the three classes\n\n<$D> \n\nUh case A and B\n\n<$A> \n\nCase A\n\n<$D> \n\nUh the variable of uh more or or less  pareho lang  <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nSo that more or less the students are of the same ability\n\n\nCase what about case B\n\n\nAre we not going to discuss case B\n\n<$D> \n\nFor case A case B  pareho lang ang  average  nilang lahat pare-pareho lang ah maliliit ang  difference  nila eh pero  whereas case C <unclear> word </unclear> case B  mabababa  \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nOh continue Manuel\n\n\nWhat uh what can you conclude from the range\n\n\nYou 're saying that in case A, the abilities of the students are about the same as well as case B\n\n\nThe abilities of the students are also about the same\n\n\nWhat about case C\n\n\nThe abilities of the students are\n\n\nWhat\n\n<$D> \n\nVaried\n\n<$A> \n\nAre varied\n\n\nRight class varied\n\n\nYou have a very bright kid and you have I will not say it any more  \n\n\nNow in other words this group is a variable group\n\n\nThe variability is so large\n\n\nThe larger the range the more variable is the group\n\n\nDo you understand\n\n\nThe smaller the range the less variable is the group the more similar is the group\n\n\nThat is why if we are going to describe case A and case B we have a homogeneous group a homogeneous group\n\n\nSame ability group same ability\n\n\nIn case C we have a heterogeneous group heterogeneous group so that if you are given only the range you are given an information about the variability of the class or of the group\n\n\nIs this clear\n\n\nUh is this clear\n\n\nSo that 's the simplest\n\n\nBut the range class only depends on two values on the highest and the lowest\n\n\nYou really don't know how the values in between vary\n\n\nThat is the limitation\n\n\nDo you understand\n\n\nThe limitation of the range is is that you would not know how the values between the highest and the lowest  vary\n\n\nSo if this is your highest and this is your lowest you know the distance you know the spread of the highest versus the lowest\n\n\nBut the the scores  in between you don't know\n\n\nThis is the limitation\n\n\nThat 's why we have to go farther down\n\n\nLet 's go to a measure of dispersion which is the variance\n\n\nLet us go immediately to the variance number three the standard deviation and number four the coefficient of variation\n\n\nThese are the four okay\n\n\nNow the inter-quartile range is defined as is also one of the measures inter-quartile range\n\n\nNow we to okay up third quartile right\n\n\nSo Q three minus we also to okay up first quartile right minus first quartile\n\n\nThis is your inter-quartile range\n\n\nIt is a measure of uh variability because if we ever say this is your normal curve this is your Q two this is your Q one this is your Q three \n\n\nIt is really Q three minus Q one\n\n\nThis is really your inter-quartile range, Q three minus Q one\n\n\nDo you understand\n\n\nSo let me repeat that\n\n\nThis is Q two the median first quartile third quartile inter-quartile range is Q three minus Q one\n\n\nSo in other words this is the the inter-quartile range okay\n\n\nNow but we will not emphasize on that we will emphasize on two three and four\n\n\nWe will focus our attention on two three and four\n\n\nThe variance standard deviation and coefficient of variation\n\n\nAlright, \n\n\nLet me begin by a very simple example\n\n\nAlright let 's say,  let 's say we have a small department store and uh we are going to record the sales the daily sale of this small store\n\n\nLet 's pick one item and the item is the designer jean alright\n\n\nLet us record the daily sale of the designer jean of this particular store\n\n\nLet 's say on Monday this store sold one pair only of designer jean\n\n\nOn Tuesday two pairs\n\n\nOn Wednesday three\n\n\nOn Thursday four\n\n\nOn Friday five\n\n\nYou know there are other items also but we are only concentrating on one specific item that is the designer jean\n\n\nSo if we take the average sale of this particular unit what is our daily average daily sale\n\n\nHow many\n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nThree so how do you get the mean\n\n\nSo we take the summation of X  three six ten fifteen summation X divided by N or fifteen divided by five is three\n\n\nAverage daily sale is three\n\n\nThree pairs of designer jean\n\n\nNow, if I want to know how each day is doing each day 's sale is doing in comparison to the average I am going to take the deviation from the mean right\n\n\nSo that let us prepare another column which is X minus X bar\n\n\nWhat am I doing here\n\n\nI want to compare Monday 's sale with the average daily sale\n\n\nOn Monday they sold only one  one pair of designer jean and if you compare it with the average, Monday 's sale is below the average by how many pairs\n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nBy two\n\n\nBecause you sold two pairs below the average you have a negative deviation, right\n\n\nThis is actually one minus three\n\n\nThis is X is one X bar is three, one minus three\n\n\nSo you would have a negative deviation minus two\n\n\nBecause you have a negative deviation we want to make this positive\n\n\nHow do we make a negative positive in algebra\n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nTaking the absolute value or, squaring, right\n\n\nHow do you how do you get rid of a negative value in algebra\n\n\nTake the absolute absolute value or another way is by squaring\n\n\nSo let us square the deviation from the mean so that minus two becomes now plus four\n\n\nThe actual deviation is really two two below because you sold only one pair and the average is three pairs\n\n\nSo one minus three is minus two\n\n\nBut we don't want to handle negative deviations\n\n\nWe want to get rid of the negative sign so we are going to square and squaring a negative means positive four minus two becomes positive four\n\n\nNow you say this store sold two pairs\n\n\nAnd if you compare this with the average this is now two minus three square and this will give us one\n\n\nPlus one\n\n\nOn Wednesday the store sold exactly equal to the average\n\n\nYou hit the average on Wednesday\n\n\nSo this is three minus three square and this is zero deviation\n\n\nOn Thursday the store sold four pairs and the average is three therefore you have your one pair above the average on Thursday alright\n\n\nSo we compare four minus three square this is one and on Friday we sold how many\n\n\nFive pairs and the average daily sale is three so that what is the deviation from the mean  \n\n\nTwo pairs, right above square that becomes five\n\n\nThis is now five minus three square becomes four\n\n\nNow do you know what is happening on this column here\n\n\nYes or no\n\n\nYou know what is going on here\n\n\nWhat is going on here Ms Viduya what are we doing here\n\n<$E> \n\nWe 're getting the deviation from each other\n\n<$A> \n\nIn other words we have some pairings\n\n\nEvery single daily sale with the average daily sale in in statistics usage we 're taking the deviation from the mean\n\n\nBut that is really very technical\n\n\nIf you want it to put it in ordinary language we 're really comparing every single value every daily sale with the average daily sale\n\n\nThis is in ordinary language\n\n\nIn statistics we 're saying we 're taking the deviation from the mean\n\n\nBut sometimes other people will not understand that what are what are they doing if they they they 're taking the deviation from the mean\n\n\nWe 're actually comparing every single value this is the sale from the average daily sale that makes it more meaningful to you\n\n\nRight", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e85fc06b-93a1-49bc-bea7-74da1ae46687", "added":

{"text": "<$A>  \n\nThat becomes our background against which we can discuss uh judge the different theories that we will uh encounter when we do a review of the history of grammatical theory\n\n\nBut without a measuring rod you won't know how to evaluate  'no  \n\n\nSo that 's why we have to do also a little bit of linguistic analysis\n\n\nBut this is not a course on linguistic analysis\n\n\nIt 's a it 's a course on uh on grammatical theory so it 's actually a consideration of the various uh grammatical theories that were worked out by man in in the effort to understand the structure of language and how to describe language as efficiently as possible\n\n\nSo uh we have the first uh the \" C \" here\n\n\nWe are now on \" C \" because we finished \" A and B \" and so we uh we 'll talk about linguistic analysis and uh we find out that in our modern approach to language uh description we identify the different linguistic units in terms of their composition their distribution and their uh, various functions okay\n\n\nUh okay now we say for instance \" P \" is a phoneme and it has aspirated \" P \" in English in initial position followed by a vowel before a vowel\n\n\nThen it is uh in after an initial uh consonant it is \" P \" without aspiration\n\n\nThese are the different distributions in initial position\n\n\nWhen it is followed by a vowel it is aspirated\n\n\nWhen it is uh after a uh consonant like \" spit spit \" it 's not uh before consonant uh it is not uh aspirated\n\n\nSo there 's  no aspiration\n\n\nWe can actually put that  but that 's very narrow transcription\n\n\nThen in final position we we did say that it is always released\n\n\nA big difference between that and English uh eh in Tagalog in Tagalog you say   \" takip \"   \n\n\nWe don't release the \" P \"   ha \" takip  \"   uh uh   \" halip \" ganon  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Ulap  \n\n<$C>  \n\n\n Halip  \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Ha  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Ulap  \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Ulap  \n\n\nYou see \" P \" is not released\n\n\nSo  in final position in final position okay\n\n\nSo this is just distribution  'no  \n\n\nNow the phoneme \" P \" is in contrast with the voiced counterpart which is \" B \" \n\n\nNow how do we how do we uh identify the \" P \" the phoneme \" P \" \n\n\nBecause it is bilabial we will we 're going to go into the details of this\n\n\nThen it is stop stop\n\n\nThen it is voiceless\n\n\nYou see how you breathe and then aspirate it here aspirated plus aspiration in uh initial position uh and in final position uh released as, as opposed to Tagalog which is unreleased  'no  \n\n\nSo now what are we doing when we say it is a stop and it 's bilabial it 's voiceless\n\n\nWhat what are we    \n\n\nThis is the composition yeah these are the various features that compose the phoneme \" P \" \n\n\nSo first by composition and then we do it by    distribution    \n\n<$?>  \n \n\n<$A>  \n\nAnd then by function because it has a contrastive function\n\n\nIn other words uh \" P and B \" in English are they are they 're signals uh minimum signals of distinction\n\n\nThey are not themselves meaningful but they distinguish meaning \" pit and bit \"  \" pit and bit \" in English would distinguish\n\n\nSo there is differential differential uh uh meaning that that they signal the difference between \" pit and bit \"   'no  \n\n\nBut in themselves phonemes do not have meanings okay\n\n\nBut now  they can also have referential meaning in that they refer to \" pit \" and not to \" bit \" \n\n\nIn other words \" bit \" is a different kind of experience that they refer to as different from \" pit \" which is a difference in meaning okay\n\n\nSo now I have given you we I find that we have to do some articulatory phonetics if only to\n\n\nSo page three of the handout uh if only to make you uh aware that this was the result of a lot of work by Panini\n\n\nHe he was\n\n\nPanini\n\n\nHe he was a Hindu scholar who tried to uh, uh his name is \" Panini \" \n\n\nNo Pa Pa that nasal Pa Pangini\n\n\nThe the eh dot under here this means the nasal nasal vowel uh a nasal uh <unclear> word </unclear> Panini nini nini  oo  \n\n\nHe he he  he actually uh analyzed the vocal organs speech organs very accurately \" 'no \" and you see what happens is the diaphragm from the air hits the uh the lungs and then we  exhale uh some air  'no  \n\n\nNow what happens is like an instrument like a flute  'no  \n\n\nWe we can modify the vocal tract so the pharynx and it goes to the oral cavity normally when it 's done\n\n\nThen the uvula uh blocks the nasal cavity okay\n\n\nSo the vocal cords are the ones that uh vibrate\n\n\nThey are the ones that are very  oo  they produce vibration  'no  and and from the shape of the uh vocal cords you can have whispering\n\n\nWhen when you whisper the vocal cords are fixed and there is a little outlet at the bottom  'no  because the vocal cords have a two uh what do you call these  caritoids  \n\n\nThose are two bones that uh are more or less triangular in shape and when they do like this uh you you have what is called \" whispering \" \n\n\nAnd in and there is a a little bit of air that that escapes and that is <unclear> word </unclear> harsh sound   \" ha ha ha \" \n\n\nYeah that the position of the vocal cords is like that\n\n\nBut normally the vocal cords are open and that 's the one that vibrates and that causes vibrations in the    air  \n\n<$?>  \n \n\n<$A>  \n\nAnd that 's the one that gives you high frequency or low frequency depending on how how often yeah the pitch varies depending on how how often the the vibrations occur\n\n\nIf it 's very high sound the vibrations are very fast\n\n\nIf it 's very low sound the vibrations are    slow  are slow\n\n<$?>  \n \n\n<$A>  \n\nOkay uh then there from the stream of air coming up from the diaphragm and the lungs  ha  \n\n\nThen you you have some what is happening is like that something like this  'no  like uh like the saxophone\n\n\nBut in the saxophone the air this thing is coming from there not and not this one is the opposite the air is coming from inside  'no  going out\n\n\nThen this this uh oral cavity becomes a resonating chamber and there is a velum here that that the velar velum is that middle bell-shaped organ that if you look at the mirror and look at you open your mouth you will see we call it tonsils  \n\n\n\n   Uvula  \n\n<$Z>  \n \n\n<$A>  \n\nThe uvula\n\n\nIn French that uvula can be made to vibrate  oh that 's so the  the \" R \" in in a in in French is made by making the uvula vibrate  o   \" red \"   o   \" red \"   o  yes  o   \" red \"   oo  \n\n\nBut otherwise the function of the uvula is to close the nasal cavity so that you have a clear oral passage  'no  \n\n\nOkay so there is what uh you have  'no  \n\n\nNow what happens is that there is a series of occlusions and uh and partial occlusions so that you produce the different sounds of speech\n\n\nBut the main thing is there is an instrument for making noise  'no  \n\n\nThat that 's what 's called uh the speech organs  'no  \n\n\nThey are the ones that are really responsible for articulating language and because these speech organs have to move uh  there is the tongue blade there is the teeth and so on\n\n\nSo the the speech organs have to move from one position to the other in order to produce the sounds that 's what causes linearity in what we hear because there is a sequencing of before and after because the movements of the speech organs uh also shift from one position to the other to produce uh these various sounds okay\n\n\nNow you you look at it  'no  the, look at the uh consonant chart\n\n\nNow here is a consonant chart uh and then we will look at our uh our sagittal diagram\n\n\nIt 's called \" sagittal diagram \" \n\n\nThat 's it 's called \" sagittal \" because  sagitta  in in in uh Latin means the arrow\n\n\nIt 's the side diagram\n\n<$?>  \n Sagittarius\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah Sagittarius yes from that that same uh root\n\n\nSee if you uh halve the uh if you divide the uh face of man or the head of a man can you get the sagittal uh diagram of\n\n\nHere  'no  but you see uh if you look at this again I 'll come back to the consonants the the very first type of sound  that is produced is bilabial sound\n\n\nSo what what is involved in the production of bilabial sound\n\n<$?>  \n \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n The two lips    upper and lower lips okay\n\n\nThere you see at the on your diagram okay the two lips okay\n\n\nNow if it is uh    uh\n\n<$?>  \n Dental sound\n\n<$A>  \n\nNo    labiodental  \n\n<$Z>  \n \n\n<$A>  \n\nNo the lower lip\n\n<$?>  \n Lower lip and the upper teeth\n\n<$A>  \n\n\n\" Fa fa fa \" \n\n<$?>  \n  \" F \" fricative\n\n<$A>  \n\nOr the fricative \" F \" that becomes labiodental  'no  now interdental\n\n<$?>  \n Teeth upper\n\n<$A>  \n\nNo the tongue    the the uh \" thing \"   for instance when you say \" thing thing \" oh\n\n<$?>  \n tip of the tongue\n\n<$A>  \n\nThe tip of your tongue is between the two teeth the upper    and lower teeth    'no    \n\n<$?>  \n \n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah okay then uh after that uh you have uh\n\n<$?>  \n Alveolar\n\n<$A>  \n\nSo that when you uh make \" thin then \" and \" fat \" and \" that \" and then \" pit \" and \" bit \" then you come to alveolar\n\n\nThe \" alveolar \" means that your tongue the front blade of the tongue is touching this alveolar ridge\n\n\nThere is a ridge at the back of your teeth\n\n\nThe gums the gums on the top at the back of the teeth are this is called the \" alveolar ridge \" \n\n\nAnd in English you say \" cat ten ten \" but not in Tagalog\n\n\nIn Tagalog we say \" ten ten \" \n\n\nIt 's dental\n\n<$?>  \n \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n\" Ten ten,   tao tao   \" we we hit the \" T \" \n\n<$?>  \n \n\n<$A>  \n\nNo  we laugh when we do that because that 's what the Americans say   \" tao mga anak tao \"   \n\n<$?>  \n \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n  \" Maraming tao \"   because they are used to putting the tip of the tongue against the    alveolar ridge  \n\n<$Z>  \n \n\n<$A>  \n\nOkay that 's what produces that uh what do you call the uh sound of English \" T and D \" uh it 's alveolar\n\n\nThen alveo-palatal \" sh and dz \" \n\n\nWhat happens is the the middle part of the tongue is put up against the roof of the mouth  'no  \n\n\nUh \" sh \" you hear this the \" shin shin and chin chin and chin \" uh in \" chin \" there is an element of stop but this one is friction yes friction \" chin \" or uh \" vision vision \" \n\n<$Z>  \n \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n\" Vision \"   there is a \" D \" and then the \" K \" and the \" G \" the back part of the tongue is against the\n\n<$?>  \n Velum\n\n<$A>  \n\nAgainst the velum oh the velum is that part of the section of the back part of the mouth that is soft that 's called \" velum \"   'no  \n\n\nWhen we were students when we were students we had to to use a    uh  a mirror and look and fix it\n\n<$?>  \n \n\n<$A>  \n\nBut you are not actually going to be phoneticians so you will have no exercises in phonetics because we had hours and hours of it transcribing what we hear sounds of different languages and we had to be very particular\n\n\nNow uh there is such a thing as \" narrow transcription and broad transcription \" \n\n\n\n\" Narrow transcription \" is what we call phonetics  'no  \n\n\nEverything we hear we symbolize, but in phonemics  'no  we are concerned with the phoneme and we are concerned with classes of sounds\n\n\nHere you look at this class of sound \" P \" has this different variants  'no  these different variants P aspirated uh P non-aspirated and P released in final position\n\n\nThese are only variants of the same uh \" P \" the class of \" P \" and you know English speakers do not distinguish between P aspirated and P non-aspirated\n\n\nThey cannot hear that\n\n\nThey they still consider that \" P \" but strange strange because they would they 're expecting that explosion to be there in in the initial position if you they don't hear it they think it 's a \" B  \" that is pronounced because \" B \" is not aspirated yeah\n\n<$?>  \n Aspirated", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

word </unclear> project we 've sort of summarized these skills\n\n\nSo we 're moving into two other important skills for shooting which is lighting and recording\n\n\nToday we 're going to discuss, just the basics about lighting\n\n\nThe more advanced, uhm discussion of lighting will be the cinematic course next term\n\n\nThen next week will be recording okay\n\n\nWe 'll do a little bit of recording today but we 'll talk more about recording next week\n\n\nThat 's March thirteen okay, \n\n\nI 'm presuming in this course this talk on lighting between now and before we have the break you had already some idea of lighting in your FOTOGRA  courses right\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nFOTOUP  \n\n\nSome of you took up FOTOUP  \n\n\nSo a lot of this is basic\n\n\nIt 's a review and because it 's basically a review I can ask you to demonstrate already certain concepts\n\n\nHow many have taken FOTOGRA  here okay\n\n\nAnd some of you have taken additional FOTOUP  \n\n\nSo what we 'll do is review and the best way to review is to do a hands-on review okay\n\n\nMuch also of this discussion is taken from this reading which I will give you\n\n\nHodgeton pages eighty-nine to one o six\n\n\nPlease take that down\n\n\nYou 've got to read that\n\n\nHodgeton page eighty-nine to one o six, \n\n\nYour basic material for producing images is light right\n\n\nOkay, without light then you could not be able to produce a subject the image\n\n\nLight interacts with the chemicals light interacts with print\n\n\nIn all stages light is critical\n\n\nFor that was as far as still photography is concerned\n\n\nWhat do you think is going to be now the major difference between light for still photography and light for moving pictures the cinematography\n\n\nWhat is it about light that is different, light as we see in reality with light that we see in film or in pictures, \n\n\nAnd what do we do about that difference in the medium of film or video\n\n\nFlores\n\n<$E> \n\nSir the light varies so you have to always uhm fix the setting of the light with the uhm <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay what is the basic difference between light as we see all around us and light that you see in pictures in film\n\n<$F> \n\nArtificial, \n\n<$A> \n\nIs it totally artificial\n\n\nEven if you use artificial light sources what is your aim\n\n<$F> \n\nYou highlight the subject\n\n<$A> \n\nWhereas light in real life\n\n<$G> \n\nUncontrollable\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$G> \n\nBeyond control\n\n<$A> \n\nAlright very good\n\n\nLight in real life is uncontrollable\n\n\nLight in real life is dispersed\n\n\nLight in real life has no direction\n\n\nLight in real life just falls and surrounds you whereas light in film and pictures has a certain control\n\n\nYou are after a certain effect\n\n\nAnd usually the effects would be number one to make the subject visible number two to be able to separate the subject foreground from background so to create effect number three to accentuate certain features of the subject\n\n\nFor example you want to accentuate texture you want to accentuate form you want to accentuate uh tone of a subject\n\n\nAnd fourthly the most important characteristic of light in film or video would be to create a certain, mood okay\n\n\nSo you have those four basic purposes of light in film\n\n\nCould you run that again\n\n\nWhat 's the first one\n\n\nSales\n\n<$H> \n\nUhm make the subject visible\n\n<$A> \n\nUh to make the subject visible\n\n\nOkay number two Cuison\n\n<$I> \n\nTo differentiate <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay in other words creative depth\n\n\nNumber three Lim\n\n<$J> \n\nAccentuate texture tone\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay then number four Paragao\n\n<$K> \n\nTo create a certain mood\n\n<$A> \n\nTo create a certain mood okay\n\n\nSo with these four purposes in mind our question now is how do we control the light\n\n\nWhat is our guideline in controlling the light\n\n\nFirst let 's talk about basic quote and unquote rules in lighting  'no  \n\n\nAs with editing, camera movement, sound-mixing, what do you think is going to be our basic guideline in lighting\n\n\nI mentioned certain three things editing camera movement sound-mixing\n\n\nWhat was our guideline in the three in order for it to look good, \n\n\nHow do we know editing a good cut is is well done\n\n\nHow do we know that sound-mixing is well done\n\n\nHow do we know that the camera movement is very well done\n\n<$?> \n Continuous\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat is the key word we 've been operating on  \n\n\nNo, \n\n\nOf course there are those are ways of achieving continuity\n\n\nIt should be, \n\n\nIt should be invisible\n\n\nIn other words lighting does not call attention to itself in the same way that editing camera movement and sound-mixing does not call attention to themselves okay\n\n\nSo what do we mean by \" invisible lighting \" \n\n\nDoes that mean there will be no lighting , \n\n\nMontalban\n\n<$L> \n\nThe better uhm they don't see that we 're uhm since it 's not natural they don't see it as not natural\n\n\nIt looks like it 's part of the whole scene\n\n<$A> <90> Alright so light when you say \" invisible lighting \" lighting should be as realistic as possible or approximating the natural light that we would find in the scene, \n\n\nLacson you have a question\n\n<$M> \n\nYeah but can it be possible like you want let 's say you want to exaggerate light so you want to make it more to look fancier you could play with the lights so it would look\n\n<$A> \n\nThere is a certain context where that is acceptable <unclear> words </unclear> okay\n\n\nLike for example a a scene wherein the whole style of the film is purposely expressionistic\n\n\nWhen we say something is \" expressionistic \" you want to show your feelings for the subject\n\n\nSo you want to show distortion\n\n\nYou want to show exaggeration\n\n\nIf that style is consistent throughout the film then the lighting should go with that style okay\n\n\nNevertheless you still don't notice the lighting working that way, okay\n\n\nBecause you would say that for that kind of a situation that would be the right lighting\n\n\nIf you use a realistic lighting in an expressionistic setting\n\n\nWhat happens\n\n\nYou notice the difference you notice the lighting\n\n\nSo as much as possible you try to notice it okay\n\n\nSo that should be the first rule\n\n\nLighting should be as realistic in a scene as possible\n\n\nThe second thing would be never state what you can imply \n\n\nNever state what you can imply \n\n\nWhat do we mean by this\n\n<$N> \n\nDo not be so literal\n\n<$A> \n\nBatac\n\n<$N> \n\nDo not be so literal\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay how can lighting be literal and how can be lighting how can lighting be implicit\n\n\nSo we can talk of literal lighting\n\n\nWe can talk of implied lighting\n\n\nActually \" implied lighting \" is not the term\n\n\nThe term is \" indirect lighting \" \n\n\nWhen does lighting become literal\n\n\nWhen does lighting become uh implicit in the scene\n\n\nBatac since you mentioned it, \n\n<$N> \n\nI can't <unclear> word </unclear> the word\n\n<$A> \n\n O  Lacson\n\n<$M> \n\nI think it 's <unclear> word </unclear> time <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nIt 's artificial\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you 're saying implicit lighting is like artificial\n\n<$M> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nYou don't have to use real sources\n\n<$M> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay, in a sense  'no  \n\n\nBut what we mean here is that when we say yes Ballesteros\n\n<$O> \n\nNot necessarily\n\n\nLike uhm combination of everything the script and everything\n\n\nLet 's say uhm it 's dark something like that and then the becomes dark so\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay let us look at an example from uh  Kisapmata , \n\n\n O  you notice right we have a poster here uh Charito Solis Charo Santos and Vic Silayan okay\n\n\nThis is an example of lighting which is not direct but implied\n\n\nSo tell me what you think that is\n\n\nI 'll be turning off the volume so you can concentrate on lighting, \n\n\nOkay so what did you see on the screen Rocha\n\n\nWhat did you see on the screen\n\n<$P> \n\nWell it 's dark and the faces are just  ano  lightened\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay do we see every detail on the face\n\n<$P> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nDo we also see every detail in the room\n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so how how do you connect that example with the rule that we just talked about or with the guideline\n\n\nThe second one never state what you can imply \n\n\nSales  \n\n<$A> \n\nAlright so you don't have to light everything in order for a scene to be completely visible\n\n\nYou can choose to light and emphasize certain parts of a scene okay\n\n\nAlso you notice the way the light is manipulated makes use of a lot of shadows\n\n\nIn FOTOGRA  what do you call this\n\n\nWhen you do portraiture with a lot of shadows\n\n\nYou took your FOTOGRA  \n\n\nWhat do you do to the subject if you select certain parts of the face to be lit\n\n\nYou allow the shadow to form part of the shape of the face of the person\n\n\nWhat do you call that technique,  \n\n\nWhat there 's a word you mold \" molding \" okay\n\n\nYou mold the face\n\n\nIn other words you let the light and shadow interact so as to reveal the shape or the texture or the figure of the subject okay\n\n\nSo in that particular case we did not have to see the entire room\n\n\nWe knew they were in the room\n\n\nWe did not have to see every detail on the face\n\n\nOf course for that particular situation the important thing was the dialogue\n\n\nSo the lighting could have gone that way\n\n\nOtherwise if the situation changed maybe the lighting could have been different okay\n\n\nThird one would be a third guideline would be determine and motivate the placement of the source of light \n\n\nWe usually call the source of light the \" key light \", \n\n\nThe major source of light the key light\n\n\nSome cinematographers when they light a scene they would usually start with the major source of light because around that light they would build other lights\n\n\nSo for example if two people are talking by the window as was happening here in  Kisapmata , if we see the window in the scene then naturally if it 's morning we would expect that the light the key light would be placed by the window because naturally there would be that would be the source okay\n\n\nIf it 's a night interior where would you put the light\n\n\nIf the set is interior and night time where would be the natural   source  of light\n\n<$?> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nLet 's say I don't see the windows I just want to see the room\n\n<$?> \n The lamp\n\n<$A> \n\nThe lamp okay\n\n\nSo the lamp the table lamp would be the source of light\n\n<$?> \n moon\n\n<$A> \n\n Okay   \n\n\n Example   \n\n\nSo for example if the scene would show the window  'no  or you want to suggest there 's a window then you would make\n\n<$?> \n Put light\n\n<$A> \n\nPut light there\n\n\nBut that would not be the major source of light you 're just highlighting that\n\n\nHowever if the action happens by the window and you see the window that would be the major source of light okay\n\n\nOtherwise if you don't show it you can always suggest it\n\n\nBut if it 's happening at night you can have the table lamp as the main source of window which means that the brightness of the lamp should be bright enough to cover the entire scene and you would add other lights around in the room to boost up that major source of light okay\n\n\nA fourth uh guideline would then be plan the lighting of the film in advance, \n\n\nSince you 're only not you 're working not only with the single source of light you have to figure out then how to coordinate the other lights\n\n\nOne good practice would be to go to a place and observe, the kind of lighting that goes on\n\n\nYou know\n\n\nUh for example going to a place at sunset\n\n\nHow do the shadows fall\n\n\nHow bright\n\n\nHow fast does the light go\n\n\nOr morning\n\n\nYou 'll notice if you go to a specific room like your own room\n\n\nHow many have locked themselves up in their own room\n\n\nThe whole day  \n\n\nHave you ever noticed the changes of light, natural light in the room\n\n\nI 'm talking about light through the window\n\n\nThe quality of light in the morning is different from the quality of light at noon and as it goes into evening\n\n\nAnd even at night there are different changes of light at night\n\n\nThe light at twilight is different from the light at midnight is different from the light at around two or three in the morning\n\n\nOr the light at moon night full moon night or the light on a half-moon night\n\n\nThere 's still some relation  'no  \n\n\nAnd a good cinematographer like a designer is able to give you those shades of difference  'no , \n\n\nAs for yourselves since you 're starting we 're not after those subtle shades of difference\n\n\nWhat we 're after first is that you can make the subject visible\n\n\nWe know who 's in the frame\n\n\nYou can make the subject look interesting\n\n\nAnd when you place the lights there 's a reason for placing the lights that way\n\n\nAny question for those four guidelines\n\n\nOkay let 's go now to uh sources of light and properties of light\n\n\nBasically we only really have two sources of light\n\n\nIn fact for every scene there 's always one key light, \n\n\nWhy is that so\n\n\nWhy can't we have two key lights\n\n\nWhat are we trying to duplicate in real life\n\n\nRemember we said lighting should be as realistic as possible so why is it that in every scene no matter what the source of light is there 's only one key light", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWe continue with the lecture, on Herbert Marcuse and we told you that there were three influences on him namely Hegel  'no  Freud and Marx\n\n\nLast time we uhm explained to you the influence of Hegel on uh Marcuse and we told you among other things that for Hegel everything is in absolute unrest and so therefore nothing is static\n\n\nNothing is congealed but everything will continue to flow\n\n\nToday we 're going to take up the influence of Freud and if possible also of Marx on Marcuse\n\n\nThis is found in the book of Marcuse entitled \"  Eros  and Civilization \" \n\n\n\"  Eros  and Civilization \" \n\n\nWhat in a gist is the influence of Freud on Marcuse\n\n\nFirst of all according to Marcuse this is Marcuse 's interpretation of Freud\n\n\nThat according to Freud there are always two forces in human nature that are at loggerheads one with another\n\n\nThe positive is called the  eros  and the negative is called  thanatos  \n\n\nYou all know what  eros  means in Greek\n\n\n Eros  and  thanatos   \n\n\n Eros  means love in Greek\n\n\n Thanatos  means death\n\n\nBut here in this particular idea, Freud is trying to tell us that in every human undertaking there are two forces that are continually battling one with another\n\n\nOne is  eros  and he calls  eros  the builder of culture\n\n\nThe builder of culture  \n\n\nAnd  thanatos  is supposed to be the destroyer\n\n\nHowever he says the stronger the  eros  in other words when  eros  is on an upbeat  thanatos  is on a downbeat\n\n\nIf  eros  is down then  thanatos  is up\n\n\nWhat does it mean\n\n\nLet us take for instance the building of culture\n\n\nIt 's something interesting because you know you never I 'm sure uh looked upon it in this manner\n\n\nLook at the way Marcuse explains it\n\n\nHe says culture and civilization require a sublimation a desexualization for culture obtains a great part of the mental energy it needs by subtracting from sexuality \n\n\nWhat does that mean\n\n\nIt means that if I want to be a great writer if I want to be a great artist if I want to be a great researcher and scholar I cannot be at the same time, be oversexed\n\n\nMeaning to say, sexuality is energy right\n\n\nThe building of culture requires energy\n\n\nIf I already spend a lot of my energy on scholarliness on art on culture and all that what happens\n\n\nI have already removed part of my erotic energy and what would happen later on\n\n\nThere is nothing left\n\n\nIf this is down that will go up\n\n\nMeaning to say I 'll become destructive\n\n\nI will become cruel\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause I don't have any sexual expression\n\n\nI uh do my work all the time all day and all night\n\n\nI have no time for play\n\n\nAnd what happens\n\n\nThat energy which is repressed will express itself in cruelty in violence\n\n\nYou might ask what is Marcuse trying to say\n\n\nSimple\n\n\nHe says how can you explain that the countries that are most cultured are the most destructive\n\n\nHow can you explain Germany supposed to be one of the most cultured in the world was capable of exterminating six million Jews\n\n\nHow do you explain that\n\n\nHere is a country full of culture produced the three B 's Bach Brahms and Beethoven produced Schiller Goethe\n\n\nHow come that it is capable of exterminating six million Jews\n\n\nAnd the explanation of Marcuse is because the erotic energy was so repressed so suppressed and that energy had to go and be expressed sublimated in another way\n\n\nAnd that is why he says look at the most cultured countries in the world they are the most cruel and violent\n\n\nMeaning to say do not look to the you know the little uh individuals like uh Pol Pot like Idi Amin\n\n\nThese are little you know little uhm butchers\n\n\nWhat did Pol Pot really do\n\n\nMaybe he exterminated let us say one hundred skulls one thousand skulls ten thousand skulls\n\n\nHave you ever seen a picture wherein we have here a an entire wardrobe all containing skulls\n\n\nAnd we are alarmed we say what cruelty \n\n\nOh my goodness what are ten thousand skulls against six million\n\n\nIn other words the small minds of Pol Pot and Idi Amin were not enough to be able to, to prove enough cruelty to be  genocidia  \n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause it did not really have what it took\n\n\nBut he says look at Germany the one that has really produced the great musicians the great philosophers remember you count Hegel Fichte  Schelling   etcetera  \n\n\nThey were the ones who had produced the most cruelty\n\n\nWhat is the reason\n\n\nBecause of this energy of  eros  that was so suppressed\n\n\nThey built culture\n\n\nThey had no time for play\n\n\nThey had no time for sexuality\n\n\nAnd so what happens\n\n\nThat sexuality that was suppressed that energy for sexuality that was suppressed will come out in \" thanatos \" \n\n\nAlright you know let me give you an instance\n\n\nYou might say does that mean that uh I should therefore give way to my sexual energies so that I will not be cruel \n\n\nWell in in a way let 's look at it from the individual point of view\n\n\nLike your fathers your fathers your own fathers\n\n\nA father that works very hard a father that is morally upright a father that has no vices is usually is a father who is a little strict and sometimes cruel with his children\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause he says son daughter if I can do it why can't you\n\n\nLook I work eight hours a day\n\n\nI do everything for you\n\n\nI 've no time for play and that 's the reason you 're prosperous \n\n\nBut look on the other hand on the father who has a number two or maybe a number three or who gambles who drinks he is very kind to his children\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause he wants to salve his conscience\n\n\nHe wants to say look I 'm indulging myself let me at least be kind to you\n\n\nHow much will you need for this\n\n\nHere \n\n\nWhat is true of individuals is true of countries and Marcuse is telling us very clearly the explanation why the countries that are most cultured are without our meaning to underestimate them they 're the most cruel\n\n\nNow you might say Germany is there any other country that might have been another example\n\n\nThe answer is yes\n\n\nAnd that is the United States the United States\n\n\nThe United States is supposed to be the bastion of liberty\n\n\nThe United States the Americans are supposed to be the apostles of what fair play democracy but look what they did to Vietnam and now to Iraq\n\n\nBut never mind Iraq for a while\n\n\nLet me concentrate on Vietnam\n\n\nVietnam\n\n\nWhat did they do to this small town called My Lai  \n\n\nYou know what they did to My Lai\n\n\nThey razed it to the ground\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause the Vietcongs were coming and they told the people of My Lai we are going to burn your town in order to save it \n\n\nWhat kind of logic is that, \n\n\nI 'm going to kill you so that you won't be sick, \n\n\n Ha  \n\n\nAnd that 's exactly what it did\n\n\nIt dropped napalm bombs on My Lai\n\n\nUp to now there is nothing that will grow in My Lai\n\n\nAnd you might say how can the United States such an advanced, cultured country how can it do that \n\n\nCould it be that something that you will not hear that uh Africa Ghana or where did Idi Amin come from something that Cambodia cannot do\n\n\nYou might say oh my goodness the most primitive are the most cruel that is not true\n\n\nThe most civilized the most cultured are the most cruel\n\n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat about uhm they were <unclear> words </unclear> Japan something very uhm sexually promiscuous yet uh we had also the   <unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh   it is the time element that changes\n\n\nThat oversexuality came after they had already conquered everything\n\n\nSo what happened\n\n\nThe soldiers became soft\n\n\nThey had no work to find anymore so what happened\n\n\nThey started to have  catamites  look it up in the dictionary if you don't know what a  catamite  is\n\n\nThey started to indulge in in sexuality\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause there was nothing else\n\n\nBut before that look at the legions of Rome\n\n\nThe legions of Rome were the most uh uhm how shall I put it\n\n\nThe most disciplined\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause they had a lot to conquer\n\n\nAnd because they had a lot to conquer they were more they were more disciplined\n\n\nThey were sturdier\n\n\nNow after that when everything was finished they are now starting to decline\n\n\nUhm if you uh get hold or if you uhm attended my lecture on Arnold Toynbee sometime ago you would have known that that 's the way it is with civilizations\n\n\nThere is a kind of birth of civilizations genesis then a build-up and then once the apex is reached there is a tendency to fall down\n\n\nThis has happened in many countries\n\n\nRome\n\n\nRome at first it was a building of culture\n\n\nThe moment they reached the apex there is no other way to go but down\n\n\nNow let 's go to Iraq\n\n\nThe United States what did it do to Iraq\n\n\nWhat did it do\n\n\nThe United Nations just said look uh you 're going to save Kuwait \n\n\nBut what did it do\n\n\nIt bombed Baghdad\n\n\nOf course you and I were secretly rejoicing wasn't it\n\n\nOf course you and I were saying oh down with Saddam \n\n\nBut that 's not the point\n\n\nThe point is how can a country like the United States allow such an idea of exterminating almost almost exterminating an entire country just because of Kuwait\n\n\nThis is an example of Marcuse 's explanation that the most civilized countries are the most destructive not the primitive countries but the most cultured countries like Germany\n\n\nWherefrom he came and the United States which is now his second country\n\n\nDo you have any questions about it\n\n\nThis is a this is a way of explaining that uhm that 's the way it goes the more civilized you are the more cruel you are\n\n\nBecause take a good look which countries are producing the most destructive weapons\n\n\nWhich countries\n\n\nThe most civilized Germany the United States Britain France Russia\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause of their civilization\n\n\nNot \" in spite \" but \" because \" of their civilization because they knew a systematic way of demolishing an entire an, entire clan or entire race\n\n\nLook at Hitler my goodness\n\n\nHow could anyone in his right mind accept the doings of Hitler\n\n\nThe Germans would you say for instance that the Germans were uh stupid\n\n\nThey were not\n\n\nThey were very cultured\n\n\nHow come they accepted\n\n\nMaybe it was because they knew that uh after all after all that is said and done Hitler was there\n\n\nHe was their  Fuhrer  and so therefore whatever he did was just acceptable to them\n\n\nBesides there was a carrot dangling in front of them  Deutschland Uber Alle  Germany over everything \n\n\nAnd you know when you dangle that carrot in front of any nation what nation will not accept\n\n\nEven now the United States\n\n\nLook at what happened after the uhm after the the declaration of uh or the I say declaration of war it was not actually a declaration of war\n\n\nBut the hostility started on January seventeen and what did the American people do\n\n\nThey were waving flags\n\n\nThey were wearing T shirts that would reflect in order to show that we are with you\n\n\nWith what\n\n\nCome to think of it it was destruction\n\n\nIt was the extermination of a people and yet they were for it\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause in the end they will say rah rah rah the United States \n\n\nI am not against it as I told you we were all secretly rejoicing that Baghdad after all was going to be bombed and we were secretly hoping that in one of the bombings Saddam Hussein would be there and dead\n\n\nYou and I are guilty\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nWe are supposed to be cultured and yet at the back of our mind we are hoping that in one of the bombings Saddam Hussein would be one of them\n\n\nPerhaps another person who is less cultured less intelligent would not even have thought of it\n\n\nNow there you are\n\n\nWhat is the explanation\n\n\nIt is because lack of play will make a person more vicious\n\n\nAny other question you 'd like to ask me\n\n\nAlright if you 've no other question then let us now go to the part of Marx\n\n\nOn the part of Marx, \n\n\nMarx you all know, based his teachings on Hegel\n\n\nAs I was telling you last time Hegel did not realize that by espousing a theory of the thesis and the antithesis producing the synthesis he would spearhead the communist movement\n\n\nBut now what is the influence of Marx on Herbert Marcuse\n\n\nLet 's begin with the following\n\n\nWhat is Marx saying to us\n\n\nWhy does he make a big dent on the mind of any young student\n\n\nIn other words why are there many Marxists in our midst\n\n\nAnd I am not going to be surprised if right here in this class there are those who are majoring in political science who are young Marxists\n\n\nWhy is this so\n\n\nLet me single out a few ideas\n\n\nMarx is famous for  Entfremdung  \n\n\nWhat is  Entfremdung  \n\n\n Entfremdung  means alienation\n\n\nWhat is this idea of  Entfremdung  or alienation\n\n\nLook\n\n\nAfter the Industrial Revolution when machines started to take the place of human labor it became very clear that machines were going to take the place of what was or what used to be the work of individuals\n\n\nLet us begin before the Industrial Revolution\n\n\nAlright", "subdomain":

grade\n\n\nSo over all whatever recitation points you get we 'll just average it and uh it 's going to be considered over a hundred okay\n\n\nNow, I haven't checked the papers yet so, most probably I 'll give it back to you by Wednesday okay\n\n\nBut anyway oh is there a tape recorder\n\n\nUh oh sorry\n\n\nSo anyway uh I got conscious because the tape recorder is there\n\n\nBut anyway I 'll give

okay\n\n\nNow, don't worry about it you don't have to be conscious  \n\n\nIt 's not going to take a picture of you , \n\n\nOkay so uhm this is a course which is supposed to talk about contemporary national development\n\n\nAnd before we go further into that uh we have to talk about, development and growth first as contrasted with one another okay\n\n\nSo I think in the in the quiz I gave you I asked the question about development right\n\n\nSo what do you think is development\n\n\nMs Maralit Myla\n\n<$B> \n\nSir uhm the process of development is the process of improving the quality of life\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's the process of improving the quality of life\n\n\nThe end-all objective of course of development is to improve welfare right\n\n\nSo when we talk about an improvement in welfare it automatically means an improvement in the standard of living\n\n\nBut anyway uhm let 's try to get a more comprehensive definition of economic development\n\n\nSo aside from improving the standard of living is there any other thing aside from the process of improving the standard of living is there any other thing you would like to add to what Ms Maralit said\n\n\nMs Lee Mirabel\n\n<$C> \n\nAside from aside from that uh economic development is increasing people 's freedom to choose\n\n<$A> \n\nSo increasing people 's freedom to choose\n\n\nSo if you have a wide variety of choices it means that you are also approaching development\n\n\nWhy\n\n<$C> \n\nFor example <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm so is it good for us or is it bad for us, \n\n\nSo for the consumer it 's generally good right\n\n\nIf you have a wide variety of products to buy which are going to satisfy you it 's generally good\n\n\nSo aside from process of improving standards of living aside from having a wider variety of choices is there any other thing uh you would like to add to  \" development \" \n\n\nMs De Leon\n\n\nWhere are you Ms De Leon\n\n<$D> \n\nDe Lara\n\n<$A> \n\nSorry De Lara\n\n\nLet me write this down again\n\n\nCan I borrow your pen please\n\n\n O  Ms De Lara\n\n<$D> \n\nUhm it involves changes in structure uh <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so let 's talk about the actual  definition given in the text okay\n\n\nSo if you take a look at different economic development textbooks you will find different definitions but if you take a look at the  Darish  text I think it gives the most comprehensive definition of what development is okay\n\n\nSo let 's try to give that definition and let 's look at it one by one okay,  \n\n\nOkay now so in all my economic development classes as well as in all of my CONADEV  classes I normally start out with this definition okay\n\n\nAnd then I ask the rest of you to try and translate it for me\n\n\nSo it  is a multidimensional process which involves changes in structures attitudes institutions inclusive of sustained increases in output creation of more jobs and eradication of mass poverty  \n\n\nNow in the definition do you find economic growth there\n\n\nMs De Lara\n\n<$D> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWhere is economic growth there in the definition\n\n<$D> \n\nSustained increases in output\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so when you talk about sustained increase in output this is actually the definition of economic growth\n\n\nSo going back to the quiz I gave, is economic growth the same as economic development, \n\n\nMs De Lara\n\n<$D> \n\nUhm for me economic growth is part of economic development\n\n<$A> \n\nSo it 's not necessarily the same right\n\n\nThey 're not the same because economic development covers a wider scope compared to economic growth\n\n\nEconomic growth is just talking about sustained increases in output\n\n\nOn the other hand development covers a lot of other things outside of economic growth right\n\n\nSo the answer there is they 're not the same okay\n\n\nNow if you read the  Darish  text and you were able to give me this answer this is an automatic five points for you\n\n\nNow if you gave something which is close I give you a four\n\n\nIf you if you write something there which has the idea and uh, despite writing it in different words although the idea is the same I might give you a three or a three point five out of five points\n\n\nNow if it 's if it 's really far off uh I can give you maybe one point five or one okay\n\n\nBut anyway as long as you give me an idea which is relatively close to the definition I 'll give you points for it okay\n\n\nNow let 's try to, talk about the definition phrase by phrase okay\n\n\nWhat exactly is the meaning of \" multidimensional \", \n\n\nMr Gello  uhm\n\n<$E> \n\nGello  \n\n<$A> \n\nGello  sorry\n\n<$E> \n\nIt involves different aspects of the economy\n\n<$A> \n\nSo \" multi \" means, many right\n\n\nMultidimensional\n\n\nSo it means many facets or many faces\n\n\nSo aside from having a multidimensional process it involves changes in structures\n\n\nSo let 's take a look at structures, \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nSo development involves changes in structures\n\n\nMultidimensional process\n\n\nLet 's take a look at the structures one by one\n\n\nWhat particular structures are you aware of, \n\n\nUhm what is a structure in the first place, \n\n\nApril, De Castro\n\n\n Ha  what is a structure anyway\n\n<$F> \n\nIt 's like a framework\n\n<$A> \n\nFramework correct\n\n\nSo a structure is a framework\n\n\nNow what kind of structure are we aware of existing today, uhm\n\n\nIn your everyday life it 's a set-up right\n\n\nIt 's a framework\n\n\nSo in our everyday life do we know of any structure which is existing, \n\n\nUh let 's be more specific\n\n\nIn terms of people\n\n\nSo when you talk about classes of people how are they categorized\n\n\nCommonly\n\n<$F> \n\nUhm  bale  their purchasing power uhm their wealth\n\n<$A> \n\nSo people are normally classified in terms of income brackets right\n\n\nSo when you have different classes of people you automatically talk about social structure  di ba , \n\n\nAs part of development Ms De Castro is there anything you would like to change regarding the social structure\n\n<$F> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat\n\n<$F> \n\n'Cause uhm if we <unclear> words </unclear> still go on with the present structure I don't think we can achieve uhm uhm a development probably because most of uhm it 's a the prevailing framework is uh  bale  that the rich are getting richer the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat exactly is the existing social structure in the Philippines\n\n\nCan you show it, \n\n\nIs it possible to illustrate social structure in the Philippines\n\n\nHow does it look like, \n\n<$F> \n\nUpper middle middle class\n\n<$A> \n\nSo in what form does it look does it take\n\n\nSo it looks more like a pyramid right\n\n\nSo if you take a look at the social structure in the Philippines it looks like a pyramid\n\n\nWhy is it considered a pyramid\n\n<$F> \n\nSmall parts  bale  the top of the pyramid which consists of the upper class is relatively smaller than that of the lower class\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so when you talk about income classes, and you talk about a specific number of people okay there are only a few people belonging to the upper income class and then the majority belongs to the lower income class or what we call the masses okay\n\n\n Mga masa  okay\n\n\nNow, if you talk about the actual income which goes to them, you can also make use of a pyramid to illustrate it but this time around it 's inverted right\n\n\n Di ba , \n\n\nA majority of the income in this particular case goes to the smaller upper class while a small portion of the income is distributed among the masses\n\n\nSo this is the existing social structure in the Philippines\n\n\nThat 's why you have different classes of people upper middle and lower class\n\n\nOkay now if you go outside of the Philippines especially if you go to India for example there is a stricter social structure okay\n\n\nSo they have the caste system wherein they have four social structures which are more rigid and there is no way by which you can move up\n\n\nIf you are born in that particular structure you cannot move up anymore\n\n\nYou 're stuck with that particular class\n\n\nOn the other hand for countries like the Philippines okay despite people belonging or beside despite a lot of people belonging to the masses there is still a chance to move up as long as you become successful in life right\n\n\nNow as part of development is there a need to change the existing social structure\n\n\nMs De Castro said yes\n\n\nWhy Ms De Castro\n\n<$F> \n\nUhm because if we maintain uhm the the actual distribution of income as it is I don't think that uhm there would be uhm as if uhm evident <unclear> words </unclear> uhm a clear development of that could be seen from the lower class\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat is the consequence of a growing lower income class  ha  \n\n\nWhat is the consequence of expanding this base\n\n\nLet 's say for example this base keeps on growing\n\n\nIs there any consequence to that, \n\n\nUhm, Aniceto, \n\n\nUh what\n\n<$G> \n\nWhat is the consequence of a growing uhm lower income class\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo  what 's the consequence to it\n\n<$G> \n\nUhm more people will be uhm needing uh needing needing jobs uh they need to uhm have a means of living\n\n\nSo we 'll be <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nSo it creates a greater population pressure right\n\n\nAside from these people suffering from low income\n\n\nBut aside from that is there any other uh consequence which is drastic\n\n\nMs, uh Ms Casigura  \n\n\nUh so let 's say for example the lower income classes are suffering from poverty\n\n\nIf the poverty gets worse and more people become poor what is the consequence of that\n\n\nUh what are we experiencing today\n\n\nWhat problem what 's the biggest problem of the military\n\n<$?> \n Sir, insurgency\n\n<$A> \n\nInsurgency\n\n\nWhat is the biggest problem of the police\n\n<$?> \n Crime\n\n<$A> \n\nCrime\n\n\nSo when you talk about insurgency and crime this all leads to social unrest okay\n\n\nSocial unrest\n\n\nSo if you do not try and change the existing class structure it will lead to social unrest especially if the mass the masses increase and they suffer from more poverty okay\n\n\nSo when they 're in poverty it 's automatic they suffer from low levels of living but what I was asking for was the consequence\n\n\nIf you don't solve the problem ultimately it 's going to result to more crime\n\n\nIt might result to people joining the insurgency because they want to change the whole system okay\n\n\nUh so that 's one\n\n\nWhat other structures are you aware of\n\n\nMr Toledo\n\n\nWhat other structure are you aware of which needs changing aside from social structure\n\n<$I> \n\nPolitical\n\n<$A> \n\nUh political\n\n\nWhat about \" political \", \n\n\nWhat exactly is politics Mr Toledo, \n\n\nWhen you say that politicians are uh no let 's let 's rephrase that\n\n\nWhen we say that uh people are playing politics what exactly is the meaning of that\n\n\nWhen the word \" politics \" comes to mind what 's the first thing you think of\n\n\nMr Toledo\n\n<$I> \n\nPower\n\n<$A> \n\nPower okay power\n\n\nSo when you talk about political science it it studies the reallocation of power right\n\n\n Pagka ang mga tao namumulitika ibig sabihin ano  \n\n\nThey try to influence people right\n\n\nAnd of course influence comes with wealth and power okay\n\n\nNow what exactly is the existing political structure in the Philippines\n\n\nMr Toledo, \n\n\nWhat kind of government do you have\n\n\nUh democratic form of government right\n\n\nDemocratic form of government\n\n\nNow is there anything wrong about having a democratic form of government\n\n\nIs it efficient\n\n\nIs it able to provide enough public services what\n\n\nUhm Mr Toledo  \n\n\nUhm so most of the rich people have the positions in government okay\n\n\nBy the way when you talk about our government okay the democratic presidential form of government it 's divided into three branches right\n\n\nJudicial legislative and executive\n\n\nSo Mrs Aquino and all of her cabinet members belong under the executive house right\n\n\nIt 's called the \" executive \" because they execute they are supposed to execute all of the policies they are supposed to implement all of the programs\n\n\nWhen you talk about legislative, law-making right\n\n\nLaw-making and then when you talk about judicial they take care of settling disputes okay through the courts the legal system\n\n\nNow, there are different types of democratic systems right\n\n\nYou have presidential you have parliamentary\n\n\nQuestion in the Philippines uh do you think the presidential form of government is effectively giving public services to all of us\n\n\nMr Catabian\n\n\nWhere are you uh  Oo 'yong gobyerno natin ngayon  is it giving efficient services public services for all of us\n\n\nPresent government\n\n<$J> \n\nSir uhm in my opinion\n\n<$A> \n\n O  in your opinion\n\n<$J> \n\n Hindi masyadong marami  <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nDelegation of responsibilities why did you say that\n\n<$J> \n\n'Cause sometimes the responsibilities overlap\n\n<$A> \n\nOverlap so it 's not \" red tape \" anymore\n\n\nIt 's a matter of defining function\n\n<$J> \n\nSir \" red tape \" is another thing\n\n<$A> \n\n\" Red tape \" is another thing\n\n\nLet 's talk about something which is more concrete something which we experience every day\n\n\nSomething which you can blame on government, \n\n<$?> \n Garbage\n\n<$A> \n\n O  garbage garbage right garbage\n\n\nSomething which you can blame on government\n\n\nAll of us pay taxes by the way none of you are paying taxes yet but your parents pay taxes we pay taxes okay\n\n\nSo we expect efficient public services\n\n\nBut what is the problem\n\n\nEfficient services are not being given okay\n\n\nAnd garbage is one example\n\n\nGarbage is piling up everywhere\n\n\nCollection seems to be very very inefficient\n\n\nIn fact drainages are being clogged because of garbage the reason is there aren't enough dump sites okay\n\n\nSo what is happening\n\n\nSo it must be the fault of the government right", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

several years I won't tell you how many years  \n\n\nAnd in my study there could only be cheating on a large scale if there is a connivance and a cooperation between the President the COMELEC and the

consequence of abiding in the terms of the covenant blessings for their families and uh for those who 'll violate the terms of the covenant curse for the candidate and reproach upon the family for life\n\n<$D> \n\nThat 's a very strong statement   actually when you think about  it these these these are messages that these candidates should be thinking about\n\n<$E> \n\n Yes yes   \n\n<$D> \n\nLet me move on to Reverend Noli Estabillo who represents as assistant pastor the \" Jesus Is Lord Fellowship \" \n\n\nThis is I understand uh one of those groups called \" Born Again Christian \"

chapter two verse twenty-one he said he changes the time he changes the season he removes things and puts new things \n\n\nSo it is within the sovereignty of God to place uh those who are in authority\n\n<$D> \n\n Sa palagay n'yo ba  Reverend Estabillo  'yong mga nagdadasal ninyong mga grupo ay talagang nasa isip at nasa puso nila na ang binabasa nila sa Bibliya ay dapat mayroong uh  expression  mayroon ring nakikita na ito'y nakikita sa  sosyedad  \n\n<$F> \n\nYes of course we should not only read the Bible but we should live by the Bible\n\n<$D> \n\nIs there a way in which you are able to for example monitor the activities of your membership in in terms of their political activism\n\n<$F> \n\nUh well\n\n<$D> \n\n Kung ito ay tama  \n\n<$F> \n\nAs I said  kanina hindi mo talaga puwedeng mapaghiwalay ito 'no  \n\n\nAnd our members have been really praying for foremost for our nation\n\n<$D> \n\nThank you very much Reverend Estabillo \n I we will take a break and I would like to thank the guests that we have had who have already spoken \n\n\nAhm we want you to come back and join us in \"  Halalan Ninety-two  \"  \n\n<$D> \n\nWe will show you a video of President Aquino voting in Tarlac, \n\n\nThat was his joke  'no  \n\n\nWell anyway you can see she is voting like any ordinary citizen alright she is wearing her signature yellow color \n\n<$A> \n\nHer favorite color Ina\n\n<$D> \n\n Is it\n\n\nProbably for good luck \n\n\nAlright so there she is, \n\n\nShe stayed uh for only a few minutes at the booth I \n\n\nI 'm sure she knows exactly who she would vote for \n\n\nAlright that 's Kris Aquino, \n\n\n O  good there \n\n\nIs this her first time to vote \n\n\nHow old is Kris \n\n\nI think this is her first time to vote if I 'm not mistaken yeah \n\n\nAlright that 's another presidential daughter, \n\n\nIt 's Pinky, or Viel \n\n\nAlright there you have it the entire family went all the way to Tarlac to vote \n\n\nThere 's Ballsy Aquino-Cruz\n\n<$A> \n\n Alam mo Ina tinatime-an ko si Presidente kung  how long it would take her to vote \n\n\n Kasi ako kanina noong wala kayo sinabi ko nga Dodie 'no  it took me six minutes uh  'no  with all the sample ballots that I prepared myself  'no baka si Mrs Aquino mas kukunti Nap  but   kukumpletuhin mo 'yong benty kuwatro  \n\n<$D> \n\n Kayo naman  \n\n<$A> \n\n At saka  uhm  'no  one minute and a half minute  na siya riyan  \n\n<$D> \n\n Kayo naman   \n\n \n\n<$B> \n\n Apparently she still uh apparently she is still   going through the tedious process <unclear> words </unclear> of her preferred choices\n\n<$D> \n\nLook I 'm sure she has twenty-four like most of us \n\n\nAll of us had lists prepared \n\n\nAt least the four of us I 'm sure before we got there we knew exactly who we were voting for \n\n\nSo on the average like what Mr Cayetano said it takes about six to ten minutes per voter\n\n<$A> \n\nSo  ako kasi e ang ginagawa ko kasi kahit na mayroon akong kodigo siyempre tiningnan ko muna 'yong kodigo ko at saka uh sa mga  senatorial  nagbago siyempre ako 'no kaya  it took me some time \n\n\n Pero kung talagang susundin mo 'yong kodigo mo  easily four minutes  tapos  \n\n<$D> \n\nMr Cayetano  tapos na ho si Pangulong Aquino  \n\n<$A> \n\n O ayan inorasan ko siya  \n\n\nSo two minutes and fifteen seconds \n\n\n Palagay ko 'yan  straight \n\n\n Hindi na nag-isip ok lang 'yon 'no dahil  per time  'no dahil kung meron siyang  sample ballot  tama lang 'yon 'no  \n\n\n Ngayon sabi nga ni Nap baka iba ang binoto   \n\n<$D> \n\n Nagbibiro naman kayo  \n\n\nIt was a quick uh voting for Mrs Aquino \n\n\nAs you can see she is almost done \n\n\n Nilagyan din siya ng  indelible ink  kagaya nating lahat 'no  \n\n\nExactly how long is this indelible ink supposed to last\n\n<$B> \n\nTwo days\n\n<$A> \n\nTwo days\n\n<$D> \n\nTwo days at least two days \n\n\nAnd it will just fade away, \n\n\nAlright it 's wonderful news a lot of people I mean some naughty people are claiming that this is not as indelible as it should be \n\n<$A> \n\n Hindi basta nasa  cuticle  mo  indelible  'yon  unless you cut your finger\n\n<$D> \n\nYour fingernails  \n\n<$A> \n\n Hindi  you have another finger added to it \n\n< \n\n Pero talagang mahirap alisin  \n\n<$D> \n\n Tapos na hong bumoto ang Pangulong Aquino  \n\n\n Hinihintay na lang niyang matapos ang kanyang mga anak   \n\n\nSo ladies and gentlemen you saw the President herself cast her vote at  Hacienda  Luisita in  Tarlac kasama ho niya ang kanyang buong pamilya na bumoto  \n\n\nSo gentlemen is there anything you 'd like to say about that \n\n\nMr Rama has been very quiet \n\n<$B> \n\nWell as I was saying that the voting process itself has been solved by the COMELEC\n\n\nBut it is the counting plus continue the canvassing because you have to read so many names\n\n\nYou have to read from thirty to forty names\n\n\nHere in Metro Manila you have to read forty-four names thirty-four names\n\n\nBut uh shifting to other topic I did notice that there are several foreign observers who are here   watching  the election process and several uh foreign correspondents\n\n<$D> \n\n Yes   \n\n<$B> \n\nNow what do they think at this at this at this stage of the game\n\n\nThat 's one thing that we should probably find out\n\n\nUh what is verifiable is that uh many of these foreign correspondents have been writing about the election process of the Philippines and they take a very dim view of our democracy here and our election process\n\n\nWell uh they have been influenced also by our media because we have people in media who specialize in bashing our election process bashing the Constitution bashing our democracy\n\n\nBut uh sometimes we should know how how to count our blessings\n\n\nDo we realize that there are very few third countries in the world that hold election democratic election and there is probably none of all those who have uh emerged from a dictatorship to restore democracy while going through the election process\n\n\nThis is very uh you know delicate process and we should be happy and some of these third uh countries are watching us with some admiration and fascination that we are able to do so\n\n<$D> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo I would suggest that we should be a little more positive\n\n<$D> \n\nYes uhm Philippine politics may have its flaws but we should still   count  ourselves   lucky or <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n If you are a foreigner   and you watch and listen to all these uh the confusion, ballot boxes not arriving official ballot not arriving people cannot find their precincts  etcetera", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood evening and welcome to a very special edition of G M A News Report\n\n\nWe 're very glad that we have uh been able to put together on this program for tonight some very distinguished people very key people who will uh figure out very prominently in the news insofar as uh, helping the people affected by Mount Pinatubo 's wrath cope with the crisis of this most recent crisis\n\n\nYou know we 've had typhoons\n\n\nWe 've had earthquakes and and and uh floods\n\n\nAnd these are natural calamities that have somehow uhm, shocked this country all in in two years ' time or even uh, just in a year 's time\n\n\nAnd these natural calamities somehow have drained the resources of this government the very limited resources of this government but at the same time has also brought out the best in the Filipino people\n\n\nAnd for tonight we 're going to talk to these uh, very very busy people, and maybe talk about the process of how they are trying to uh help up in these uh relief and evacuation efforts ongoing in Metro Manila as well as in the affected areas around Mount Pinatubo\n\n\nAnd I 'm very glad that uh Rey Punongbayan is with us here\n\n\nI talked to him this morning and I asked him to sleep at about twelve noon so he can make it here\n\n\nThank you very much\n\n\nHe is the person in charge of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology called PHILVOCS for short\n\n\nMinus the L PHIVOCS\n\n<$B> \n\nPHIVOCS\n\n<$A> \n\nPHIVOCS\n\n\nThat 's how he pronounces it\n\n\nAnd of course uh, a very good friend of mine married to my contemporary in Saint Scholastica 's uh Undersecretary of the Department of Trade and Industry we have Undersecretary Ernesto Ordo&ntilde;ez\n\n\nThank you very much\n\n\nAnd we have the Undersecretary from the Department of uh\n\n<$C> \n\nSocial Welfare\n\n<$A> \n\nSocial Welfare Linda Laygo and also the governor of Pampanga Governor Bren Guiao\n\n\nWell they tell me that uh, my reporters tell me that they had a difficulty looking for you this morning and I told them that I had gotten in touch with you and that you 're going to be here\n\n\nI 'm sure a lot of people in Pampanga are watching us tonight, \n\n\nAnd at the same time may I at this point also tell you the people out there those who would like to extend some help to the victims\n\n\nYou can uh, give your donations to G M A 's \" Operation Helping Hand \" uh here in Channel seven EDSA\n\n\nWe receive any kind of donations food medicines uh, clothing blankets, uh not so much for cash but if you have cash we will also accept it\n\n\nYou can call telephone numbers nine nine six seven five three and nine six four six five zero\n\n\nOkay we will begin and very quickly the question to uh Dr Punongbayan\n\n\nWhat happened the last three days Friday Saturday and Sunday\n\n<$B> \n\nNow you want that uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYes   just very  \n\n<$B> \n\n Friday Saturday   and Sunday huh\n\n<$A> \n\nFriday Saturday and Sunday\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay that was the fourth eruption episode   of  the volcano\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd it 's uh as predicted it 's gonna be long duration\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it started at one o'clock uh Friday and ended uh thirty-six hours after that\n\n\nUh it started with a big explosion and then after so many hours we counted a total of twenty or so uh explosions\n\n\nMost of these caused uh the eruption column to rise to about uh twenty to twenty-five kilometers up up there\n\n\nUh there was a complicating factor and that one was the uh passage of the typhoon and uh it 's almost over the top of uh Mount Pinatubo\n\n\nThe consequence of that is the lower circulation of below ten kilometers is to from the Southwest to the South to the Northeast and above that ten kilometers above the circulation is from the Northeast to the Southwest\n\n\nSo what it effectively did the effect of that is deliver more ash towards the Southwest and unfortunately Metro Manila is along its path so it distributed more ash on in Metro Manila\n\n\nBut aside from that it not only affected Metro Manila it also affected Palawan and all the way to Cambodia\n\n\nSo so that 's the kind of uh blanket ash cloud that was created by that uh eruption\n\n<$A> \n\nTyphoon Diding was already predicted by PAG-ASA way back\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWas there not uh, also uh an opportunity for PHIVOCS to determine that there could be ashfalls as a result of the typhoon\n\n<$B> \n\nWell   it 's hard to project that  \n\n<$A> \n\n That 's not within   \n\n\nIt 's hard to project that\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's hard to project that because you have to determine the amount unloaded by the volcano, uh during that time during the passage of the typhoon\n\n\nAnd it created a wide blanket instead of just, uh  looming  it directly to the west it spread out, \n\n\nSo you have a thick blanket and at the same time a wide one so that it affected Metro Manila\n\n\nBut that 's not the only thing that happened uh because of the amount of material that was taken out from beneath the volcano there was a great void created underneath\n\n\nAnd we suspect that this void was compensated for by the collapse of the summit part of the volcano so that at the end a crater was formed, \n\n\nSo you have that as the net effect\n\n\nA large a large amount of material removed from underneath and collapsing of the summit part\n\n<$A> \n\nAre we supposed to be happy with that\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh I think so\n\n\nUh first uh let me tell you that uh we now have a means for determining the amount of material that was removed by the eruption\n\n\nSo that if we measure the volume of the crater uh we shall have an indirect measure for the amount of the material uh that has to be unloaded\n\n\nUh, there is such a rule that uh if you have such a volume of magma underneath ten percent of this will have to be erupted so that the eruption is over\n\n\nSo we 'll we 'll have uh an idea on how how much uh uh was unloaded during the four episodes of eruption\n\n<$A> \n\nJust in the news tonight we were talking about uh some reports unconfirmed though uh about Mount Isarog\n\n\nIs there any possibility that it could be acting up because of Pinatubo\n\n<$B> \n\nNo no it there 's no connection\n\n<$A> \n\n Wala bang koneksyon itong   Mount Unzen in in Japan\n\n<$B> \n\nWell that 's gonna be a long connection if you have to put a connection\n\n\nBut volcanoes act   independently  of each other and they have their own  slough  for going down from the magma reservoir the needed ingredient for create uh for an eruption\n\n<$A> \n\n Independently   \n\n<$B> \n\nSo they have their own tracking system to speak of\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo uh Pinatubo can erupt and Matig which is close by will remain silent and so will Mariveles Corregidor Palay-palay and Taal\n\n<$A> \n\nYou haven't noticed anything in Taal Volcano or Mayon\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh there was, a coincidence of inactivity between Taal uh and uh and Pinatubo\n\n\nIn fact uh we were monitoring Pinatubo\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nUh no Taal\n\n<$A> \n\nTaal\n\n<$B> \n\nTaal and then Pinatubo started showing signs of unrest but indirectly because uh this volcano has rested for about six hundred years and had done nothing since then\n\n\nSo we had a steamblast on April second\n\n\nAnd uh suspecting that there is something going on we set up a seismograph just to see if there 's really something going on\n\n\nAnd lo and behold there were many volcanic quakes recorded\n\n\nBut going back to uh I 'm not I 'm not finished yet with the story of the uh the creation of the crater\n\n\nUh so we have an indirect measure of the amount\n\n\nAnd I think uh we have an approximation of about, one cubic kilometer of magma, a minimum, from the total magma below\n\n<$A> \n\nCubic kilometer\n\n<$B> \n\nCubic   kilometer  \n\n<$A> \n\n That 's how much   in tons\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's one kilometer by one kilometer and one kilometer thick and that 's a lot of material\n\n\nAnd if you uh produce, ejecta uh if you double the volume so you 're talking about two cubic kilometers of uh ejecta\n\n\nThat 's ash and uh  pumice  produced\n\n\nSo I think uh the volcano has somehow unloaded what should be unloaded and only a fraction may remain to cause further uh eruption\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay we 'll get back to Dr Punongbayan and talk to our other guests right after some very very important messages   \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay you 're back with us on G M A News Reports\n\n\nWe have a special report on Mount Pinatubo and we 're very glad that you 're here with us Governor Bren Guiao of Pampanga\n\n\nIs Angeles within your jurisdiction it being a city\n\n<$D> \n\nWell it is a private city but it is within Pampanga\n\n<$A> \n\nYes of course it is but are you directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the city\n\n<$D> \n\nNo I 'm not directly involved but I am involved in the sense that uh uh some people in Angeles come from the different towns of the province\n\n<$A> \n\nI see okay the question is why did Angeles seem unprepared\n\n\nThey were aware that there was an imminent eruption considering that Clark had started evacuation\n\n\nAngeles, uh obviously was unaware and was unprepared for evacuation uh\n\n<$D> \n\nWell uh Tina I cannot speak for the officials of Angeles City, but I 'd like to speak on behalf of the province\n\n\nUh, we had been preparing for this uh since we had uh heard from uh Director Punongbayan about the possibility of eruption you know\n\n\nOur Disaster Control Council in Pampanga is adjudged as one of the best in the Philippines uh\n\n\nNow I 'm not saying that uh we are, prepared for instance uh we are now uh attending to one hundred twenty-two thousand evacuees from different parts of the province and some are coming from Olongapo and Torolles, \n\n\nAnd I cannot imagine you know feeding one hundred twenty-two thousand people\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nUndersecretary Ordo&ntilde;ez here was computing at the minimum we 'll be spending one million peso a day uh to feed uh this number of people, \n\n\nNow uh, it 's not easy\n\n\nThat 's why when I am asked Tina whether, we are uh feeding these uh evacuees adequately my answer is \" no \" \n\n\nI don't think anyone can feed or give enough food to that number of people\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes we will go into that uh, logistics of uh feeding evacuees in centers that have been put up but but my original question was, why why was Angeles uh unprepared\n\n\nUh a lot of people who are now in Metro Manila I understand come came from Angeles\n\n\nThey they just abandoned their homes uh late afternoon and there was no help whatsoever that came from the local government\n\n\nWho was in charge at that time all this was going on\n\n<$D> \n\nWell as I was telling you Tina uh Angeles is a chartered city\n\n<$A> \n\nYes what  where 's the Mayor\n\n\nIs he any\n\n<$D> \n\nThe mayor was there\n\n\nThe mayor is there and uh you know I think this is not the time for me to blame anyone\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I know we 're not blaming anyone but people just wanted to find out and get an answer as to why it became the way it did\n\n<$D> \n\nWell I would like to believe that they were really caught flat-footed\n\n\nThey did not uh expect this magnitude of uh the eruption, \n\n\nAnd uh perhaps uh as what you said they did not take a cue from   Clark  Field\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n<$D> \n\nUh you will recall that somebody said that perhaps Clark Field was over-acting over-reacting\n\n\nBut then uh, uh apparently they had a basis for their uh uh moving fast enough\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd got away from Clark Field\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you not advise Angeles   about  the possibility of the effects of ash rain\n\n<$B> \n\n Well   \n\n\nUh we had a\n\n<$A> \n\nWere they properly informed\n\n<$B> \n\nNo uh we organized a meeting\n\n\nI tried to convince them that they should prepare a plan, uh in view of the uh forthcoming eruption\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd did they show you a plan or was this in place\n\n<$B> \n\nThe mayor did not show up\n\n<$A> \n\nI see okay\n\n\nSo going back to that statement that it would take a million pesos a day to feed about a hundred twenty, thousand people in Angeles in Pampanga alone\n\n<$D> \n\nIn Pampanga\n\n\nIn the entire province\n\n<$A> \n\nHow are you getting uh I mean I know where you 're getting the money most likely from the budget releases from the government\n\n\nBut how are you doing the the purchasing and distribution of all these relief goods\n\n<$E> \n\nWell aside from the initiatives of the different departments and the governors uh this morning Secretary Garrucho met the manufacturers and uh we had a very good ally in Dr Carroscoso of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office in that he promised to pay them within two days if they gave their products at manufacturer 's price with a discount\n\n\nSo for example sardines which sells from six to six fifty\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$E> \n\nWe got it at five twenty less ten centavos  per ten  \n\n\nRice uh we 're getting rice for eight pesos and twenty centavos per kilo and in the market that same rice is about ten to eleven pesos\n\n\nAnd what the manufacturers like about this is that with Dr Carroscoso 's help they 'll get their money within two days\n\n<$A> \n\nWe 're talking of Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office\n\n<$E> \n\nYes yes", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b97ffe66-7fcd-4541-886a-07e378ae4b11", "added":

{"text": "<$Z> \n\n\n Surveys and researches point out that deep down inside men and women want in intimacy practically the same thing\n\n\n\nNumber one unqualified love and loyalty\n\n\n\nNumber two faith and intimacy\n\n\n\nIn a recent survey of one thousand two hundred men by Dr Loni Barbach a clinical psychologist the respondents revealed that men don't always want sex\n\n\n\nMost husbands just want the physical attention one that 's manifested by touching and cuddling\n\n\n\nMost men who are single said they didn't always want sex even if it was immediately available to them\n\n\n\nWhat they wanted was romance and the feeling of being needed\n\n\n\nBut what happens when romance and sex are gone\n\n\n\nCan love survive without them\n\n\n\nLet 's find out\n\n\n\nThe Philippines ' queen of talk who either enjoys the abundance or the lack of romance and sex in love Ms Jullie   \n\n<$A> \n\nI think I 'm going to be uh tongue tied tonight because we 're going to talk about romance and I 'm no expert\n\n\nI 'm only an expert in the art of expecting  not in the art of having\n\n\nBut you know there are they say that politics is the art of the possible\n\n\nFor me that is a better definition of romance the art of the possible\n\n\nWhat is possible in romance what is possible in love whatever you dream of having, the illusion of love the hoax of romance that 's what we want in our lives\n\n\nWomen need it for to get along uhm through the hard through the rough edges of the day but men expect it\n\n\nThat 's why all all the magazines that I have read the articles are always addressed to the woman\n\n\nHow to make your love life better\n\n\nHow to please your man\n\n\nBut they never tell the men what to do\n\n\nMaybe tonight we shall find out because uh we 've got three guys and the problem is they 're all single\n\n\nMaybe they 're single because they don't want to lose the romance in their lives  \n\n\nSo when we come back you 'll find out who they are  \n\n<$B> \n\n Love should be sustained by romance in its many forms\n\n\nSome people might think that love might not be present or existent any more and yet they 're appalled not really appalled but surprised why they still feel what they think is love\n\n\nSo perhaps uh my answer is yes uh and uh yes uh you know love is upheld so love love love is sustained by romance  \n\n<$A> \n\nThat was Angelo Castro and uh  \n\n\n Hoy teka muna teka muna teka muna  \n\n\nQuiet quiet first quiet first  \n\n\nThey can hardly wait to jump on the topic\n\n\nBefore we jump into the topic I 'd like to thank uh Angelo Castro\n\n\nHe 's been such a nice guy so gallant you know plugging our show at the last uh in the last twenty seconds of \" The World Tonight \" and uh the world ended tonight with \" The World Tonight \" bowing out after how many years\n\n<$?> \n Thirteen years\n\n<$A> \n\nThirteen years\n\n\nSo Angelo now that uh you 're not on \" The World Tonight \" maybe one of these days you will allow yourself to be here on our show  \n\n\nSo back to our topic romance romance romance\n\n\nIt 's not Valentine but women and and I think nowadays men, are always looking for that special spark that we call romance\n\n\nUh a touch a look a gesture that uh expresses something inside the heart and maybe uh our guests tonight can tell us more about that beginning with Mr Manoling Morato\n\n\nI think Manoling is a very romantic person\n\n\nManoling can I tell them your secret\n\n<$C> \n\nYes yes  \n\n<$A> \n\nYou know many people think that Manoling is afraid of women  to come close to  'no  \n\n\nBut he had a romance and unfortunately that girl perished in a fire sometime ago and that is the reason Manoling 's romance lives in the embers of his heart\n\n<$C> \n\nOh  \n\n<$A> \n\nCorrect\n\n\nCorrect\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay so so you would be the perfect person to talk about what happens to a man 's life when romance goes away\n\n\nIn in this case it it went away with the person\n\n<$C> \n\nWell Jullie I I 'd rather listen to the young people tonight   because I don't know what they 're  up to these days\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah well you have to share with us   \n\n\nYeah yeah  \n\n<$C> \n\nI belong to another generation\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's it\n\n\nWe will compare the expectations   of your generation  \n\n<$C> \n\n And I I think  medyo    pass\u00e9  na 'ko   ano   \n\n<$A> \n\n  Oo     \n\n<$D> \n\nNo never never\n\n<$C> \n\n Pero makikinig ako  and I I 'll try to uh speak out\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd  Manoling doesn't mind uh to express his love to his Mom\n\n\n  He is  he is one he is one person who who looks at his mother uh and puts her on a uhm pedestal\n\n<$C> \n\n I don't I don't   \n\n\nWell uh I 'm not a Mama 's boy Jullie\n\n\nShe 's like my daughter\n\n<$A> \n\nUh she 's the daughter  \n\n<$C> \n\nI rule over her\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo  \n\n<$C> \n\nShe 's totally helpless   without me  \n\n<$A> \n\n Well I   I think that happens you know\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAs as a child   grows  older the the roles are reversed\n\n<$D> \n\n Change of roles   \n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nNow Ms Cynthia Patag\n\n<$D> \n\nHi Jullie\n\n<$A> \n\nSingle forever\n\n<$D> \n\nI don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nEverybody knows Cynthia so I don't have to read all of these   except  \n\n<$D> \n\n Oh   really\n\n<$A> \n\nExcept what she said the necessity of romance and sex is dependent on the kind of love the couple enjoys \n\n<$D> \n\nDid I say that\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah  well do you believe uh that romance is missing in your life because you 're single\n\n<$D> \n\nWell we we by romance you mean the rituals of courtship\n\n<$A> \n\nWhatever   whatever  it means to you\n\n<$D> \n\n We   \n\n\nUhm  kailangan   ba 'yan   \n\n<$A> \n\n  Kailangan mo   ba ng romansa  \n\n<$D> \n\nMe\n\n\nNow\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah  \n\n<$D> \n\nMy gosh well, I haven't I went back to college, after twenty years and I 'm graduating October two   if you have  \n\n<$A> \n\n Congratulations   \n\n<$D> \n\nThank you\n\n<$C> \n\n  Congratulations  \n\n<$D> \n\n You think   I have any room for romance\n\n\nI 'm shell-shocked\n\n<$A> \n\nYou have no room for romance   and  yet you 're\n\n<$D> \n\n Not   \n\n\nNot not 'till I with a thesis  ha  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$D> \n\n Pagkatapos ng  thesis  ko  October two I 'm going off\n\n<$A> \n\n Ang ibig mong sabihin  you have to have a block of time\n\n<$D> \n\nFocus\n\n<$A> \n\nFor romance\n\n<$D> \n\nFocus\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no for love to come in you need a chunk of time\n\n\nSay from three to six this is my time for love and from six to six I have to immerse myself in my books\n\n\n Ganon ka  \n\n<$D> \n\nJullie you you have to define love\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no how can I\n\n<$C> \n\nWe cannot\n\n<$A> \n\nIf I could then I would be the greatest  ano  sage in the history of the  in the civilization of the world\n\n\nI cannot define love but maybe you can tell me what romance is\n\n<$D> \n\n  Okay  \n\n<$A> \n\n You 're   you 're going to graduate with a degree in literature\n\n<$D> \n\n Ehem  yes\n\n<$C> \n\nLiterature\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay now let 's give you the test  \n\n<$D> \n\nAlright\n\n<$A> \n\nAfter reading Shakespeare and uh Marlowe and uh whoever else\n\n<$D> \n\nOkay in the context we 're talking about love in the context of a relationship\n\n<$A> \n\nRomantic love\n\n<$D> \n\nThere are two persons I won't say the gender\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm  \n\n<$D> \n\nUh and and your question is can love survive\n\n<$A> \n\nWithout romance\n\n<$D> \n\nWithout romance, uhm platonic love yes\n\n<$A> \n\nOh yeah   by definition  \n\n<$D> \n\n But uh   romantic love no\n\n<$A> \n\nIt cannot it cannot survive   without  romance\n\n<$D> \n\n No   \n\n\nBecause there is uh sexual desire which definitely needs a consummation\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\nBut but somebody told me that uh if you were to get married or to get into a serious relationship it wouldn't be with a Filipino\n\n<$D> \n\n Ay na naman  \n\n<$A> \n\n O mamaya mamaya  \n\n<$D> \n\n Ayan na naman  \n\n<$A> \n\n O mamaya mamaya mamaya mamaya   \n\n\nFor now let 's let 's go to Lara\n\n<$C> \n\n I haven't been talking anyway   \n\n<$A> \n\nAnyway you 're spoken for  \n\n\nAnyway so Lara Lara Fabregas\n\n\nShe 's an actress and uh regular in the drama series  \" Saan Ka Man Naroroon \"  \n\n\nYou know a title like that speaks volumes  \" Saan Ka Man Naroroon \"  \n\n\nRomantic  mga  role  mo do'n  \n\n<$E> \n\n Kontrabida  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$E> \n\nUh romantic I guess 'cause all my evil derives from the fact that I 'm a scorned woman\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh you 're a scorned woman and you must have your man\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd I have to have my man and I 'll do what it takes\n\n\nI 'll kill\n\n\nWow\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's romantic that 's romantic so  natatakot nakakatakot sa mga lalaki  \n\n<$E> \n\nYeah yeah I guess it 's pretty aggressive   right  \n\n<$A> \n\n But   some men\n\n<$E> \n\nIt 's very obsessive love there  'no  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh but some men like strong women to come come on to them\n\n<$E> \n\nI don't know I mean maybe some people would like to think that a woman would go to that extent\n\n<$A> \n\nWould you\n\n\nIn real life\n\n<$E> \n\nNo I wouldn't you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYour father will kill you first\n\n<$E> \n\nYeah no I think you can't force somebody to feel  how you feel\n\n\nYou know you would love for them to love you   back  but\n\n<$A> \n\n So   \n\n\nSo why are roles like yours so popular and classic and and and ubiquitous and\n\n<$C> \n\nIdentified <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nEternal\n\n<$D> \n\nBecause of a perniciois patriarchal system\n\n<$A> \n\nWhere where the men  \n\n<$C> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nWhere the men write the stories\n\n<$D> \n\nOf course\n\n<$A> \n\nWhere they write the stories and they brainwash the women\n\n<$D> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n\nOkay okay\n\n<$D> \n\nYes but you you you deserve to be punished\n\n\nYou deserve to be punished\n\n<$A> \n\nFor\n\n<$D> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nYou deserve to be punished for grabbing a man away from his wife or his girlfriend\n\n<$D> \n\n Naku Jullie mamaya na   \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay okay\n\n<$D> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear>  eh  violence against women  na ito   \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah okay okay\n\n\n Si Dr Mario Katigbak naku ito yung romansa daw magkano  two pesos  ano  twenty pesos a day  ano 'yon  <O> laughter <O> \n\n<$F> \n\nI I I cannot answer this remember if  \" Abanse Pinay \"  is here\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$F> \n\nDagger looks dagger looks\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$D> \n\nWilling to give them jewelry\n\n\nWhat 's that\n\n<$F> \n\nTrips abroad\n\n<$D> \n\nTrips abroad\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo  \n\n<$F> \n\nActually it 's giving them love\n\n<$D> \n\n  And then  \n\n<$A> \n\n Give them   love  oo  \n\n<$D> \n\nBut\n\n<$F> \n\nThat 's all\n\n\nRomance\n\n<$D> \n\nWhat does it take to make make a woman happy   less  than twenty pesos a  \n\n<$F> \n\n Love   \n\n\nTender loving care  \n\n<$A> \n\nNo, what he was trying to say in that commercial was that the man has to be physically fit    di ba   \n\n<$F> \n\n That 's right   that 's right that 's right\n\n<$A> \n\nPhysically fit to\n\n<$F> \n\nYou know the physical aspect of romance that 's all it was dealing with\n\n<$C> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A> \n\nLike like you said you devote   all the time  \n\n<$F> \n\n I don't wanna   look at her anymore\n\n<$A> \n\nYou devote all your time to your studies and uh Mario  naman  believes in devoting a part of his life to being physically fit in order to please and pleasure his lady love\n\n\n Gano'n ba  \n\n<$F> \n\nIs isn't that you know\n\n<$C> \n\nIt 's non-chauvinistic\n\n<$A> \n\nYou don't think so\n\n<$C> \n\nThe Pharmaton    is supposed to be given  it 's supposed to be given\n\n<$A> \n\n Alright   \n\n\nYou 're not supposed to mention that name  \n\n<$C> \n\nWell I did already  I don't take it so\n\n<$A> \n\nYou don't take it you don't need it\n\n<$F> \n\nNo need no need\n\n<$C> \n\nNo he 's supposed to be giving it to the woman\n\n<$A> \n\nTo his wife to his wife\n\n<$F> \n\nThat 's correct\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo  no no he 's supposed to take it\n\n<$C> \n\nNo\n\n<$F> \n\nI think it 's open to\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's open huh\n\n<$F> \n\nTo individual interpretation\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay   okay  \n\n<$F> \n\n And   I won't say any more about it\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n\nWhat is your individual interpretation of a romantic affair\n\n<$F> \n\nUh of a romantic affair\n\n\nUh you know I I think that you know a lot of romance really depends on the people\n\n\nI 've always held that you know that you know like you can go anywhere you know uh a date can be a perfect date\n\n\n no matter where it is as long as you 're with the right person\n\n\nYou see it 's really it 's really   chemistry  \n\n<$A> \n\n Chemistry   \n\n<$F> \n\nIt 's not something external I think\n\n<$A> \n\nBut but the two of you have to express it\n\n\nIt cannot take anything for granted because if you don't let it out if you don't demonstrate it\n\n<$F> \n\nTrue   true  \n\n<$A> \n\n That 's   when it begins to wither and that 's what we 're talking about tonight\n\n\nHow do you keep the fire going\n\n\nHow do you keep the flame burning  di ba  \n\n\nUh like in the case of Manoling he didn't have the chance to light a conflagration  'no  \n\n\nOkay Mr Ryan Agoncillo is uh another commercial model and uh he 's a part of a morning show\n\n\nHe for him romance is an expression of love so it cannot be taken out of the equation of uh uhm uhm romance striving love thriving with or without romance\n\n\nIt has to have romance\n\n\nNow in your commercial you you were asking you 're asked about being in heat  ano  \n\n\nDo they allow that on T V\n\n<$D> \n\nWhat\n\n<$G> \n\nOh no  oh no\n\n\nWho 's your target here\n\n\nWell uh  \n\n<$A> \n\nThey allow that on T V in M T R C B\n\n<$F> \n\nThey did they did\n\n\nThankfully thankfully   for his sake  \n\n<$A> \n\n Because they think   uhm not many people understand what it 's trying to say\n\n<$G> \n\nWell uh\n\n<$A> \n\nAre you in heat \n\n<$G> \n\nIt has a double meaning because in the in the story uhm the the  elevator lights go off and uhm anyway they went out and then uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nYou 're sweating\n\n<$G> \n\nYeah and I was offering my my drink and I was kinda\n\n\nSee  \n\n\nOh my God\n\n\nDagger looks\n\n\nI was trying to offer her my drink and uh and in order for her to cool down instead of asking her  na uhm mainit mainit ba  or  naiinitan ka ba  I asked her are you in heat  \n\n\nShe ended up slapping me so you know\n\n<$A> \n\nUh she did\n\n<$G> \n\nYeah so she resurrected her pride, and\n\n<$A> \n\nSpeaking of pride",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThe official statements by the United States that there is no more renegotiation that they will either agree to or even allow   well, but uh  \n\n<$B> \n\n What do you expect them to say    \n\n\n Eh sasabihin ba naman nila eh  of course  pagna-  reject eh I mean that 's the  iba-bluff-in talaga tayo  \n\n\nI mean  mas <.> ma <.> 'kung mas veterano sa poker 'yan eh  \n\n\nSo  lahat ng pananakot 'no  \n\n\nWe will be terrorized into uh running this through the Senate and that we cannot do\n\n\n Dahil  we just got it now\n\n\nThere are several folders and that is uh expected rhetoric\n\n<$A> \n\nSo  hindi kayo naniniwala kay  Senator Lugar Senator all the other Senators there Congressman Solarz uh Stanley Shregger of the U S embassy Ambassador Weisner\n\n<$B> \n\n Kasi  it 's not in their best interest\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh okay\n\n\nSenator Pimentel any surprises uh among the documents that uh you 've had the chance to look through today\n\n\nOr was it uh purely as pre-advertised\n\n<$C> \n\nWell actually Dong we we took a quick look at the, uh you know several folders and documents that were sent over just a few minutes before coming to this program and there isn't any indication that there is anything new\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nThat can persuade us to change our minds\n\n\nNow Mike has pointed out that uh we are all yeah we are we are indeed friends of Cory\n\n\nThere 's no question about that\n\n\nBut in this particular case it is not so much the friendship that we have for our President or you know the esteem the respect and the love we have for her that are of primary consideration\n\n\nWe would look at this point in in the in the in the light of what is in the best interest of our people\n\n\nAnd as Rene pointed out that is exactly the reason why\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nI feel for example that the level of compensation is totally inadequate and unacceptable\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay I know that uh Senator Saguisag was probably only half-jokingly saying before the program began that he was being sandbagged because of the of the random comments we played from the public\n\n\nBut honestly that was really a reflection of what of what the people are really saying\n\n\nAnd people are saying and you know this is already the argument being made\n\n\nWho are the senators to make this decision for the people when it is very clear what the people are saying\n\n\nHow how\n\n<$C> \n\nWell we are we are only the representatives from the people as mandated by the constitution   to  act on this particular issue uh on on the treaty on treaty matters that are to be entered into by this country with other countries including the bases agreement\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$C> \n\nThat is our these are our functions as senators\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay you wanted to\n\n<$B> \n\nWell yes  dahil  it is really the fundamental question  e  \n\n\nAre we a voice or are we an echo\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$B> \n\nDo we lead or do we follow\n\n\nWhy are we here\n\n\nBecause the people voted us here\n\n\nAnd as I said yesterday  nga  in my prayer the only one who knew in nineteen eighty-seven as to how we would be voting on this\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n Iisa lang  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\n E ang Panginoong Diyos e  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWe did not know the stand of  Manong  Johnny of Erap of Butz\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut He willed that we be here at this moment in time\n\n\n Kaya 'yon nga  the voice of God should be the voice of the people  siguro  \n\n\nSo  'yon nga  we listened very respectfully to any constituent  'no  \n\n\nBut again  'yon nga sa huli niyan eh  we consult our consciences like in the case of Nene and myself\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n Matagal kaming nagsama pa sa P D P LABAN nasa  platform  'yan eh  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo there was no surprise no meaning\n\n\nWe are behaving as advertised\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd when we were elected it was partly what we stood for\n\n\nSo there was no misrepresentation on the part of Nene and me\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay what about that Senator Osme&ntilde;a I know you that you 've been going around the country and you 've been taking a sounding of what the people are saying on this particular issue\n\n\nWhat is your uh feeling of what the people in the country is saying\n\n<$D> \n\nWell I think that the the few samplings that was done on the screen are reflective of what the people out in the countryside are saying\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nIn fact in General Santos uh the Rotary Club of General Santos uh somebody suggested and said you tell those people in Manila if they don't want Sangley out there move it to Saranggani Bay \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$D> \n\nWhich is the bay in General Santos\n\n\nAnd that is the same thing\n\n\nIn Cebu uh the students in the University of San Carlos were for eighty-seven percent in favor\n\n\nAnd these are students not necessarily residents of Cebu but who comes to Cebu from Northern Mindanao and Leyte and Negros\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nSo I think that that is that is the sentiment of uh the constituency that is out there\n\n\nNow I will I will grant that under our constitution, regardless of how people may look at it the constitution says very clearly that it is our responsibility\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nThe twenty-four of us to ratify or to reject a treaty\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd so the problem really here is that when we were when that constitution was ratified in nineteen eighty-seven perhaps we were not really looking at all the provisions because we were anxious\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nTo get a constitution in place and when we ran for office in eighty-seven we all ran under the uh  mga  at what is it  pangkat ng pangulo  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd nobody really examined whether the Senators that we are electing to ratify a treaty that is going to expire in nineteen ninety-one whether they are in favor or not and therefore whether I would support or share their views\n\n\n Wala namang  we were all elected uh as the ticket of Cory so you know that 's\n\n<$A> \n\nSo in a sense you take that as a signal that you are allowed to vote what you really think\n\n\nUh what your conscience really says\n\n<$D> \n\nWell it 's not a signal\n\n\nIt is the reality of it all\n\n\nIt is the legal reality of it all\n\n<$A> \n\nLet 's take a break\n\n\nWhen we come back let 's start at uh with some issues\n\n\nWhy why for why against\n\n\nWhat are the reasons for the positions of the Senators on these points\n\n\nWe 'll be back  \n\n\nOkay before we go to substance some some mechanics\n\n\nSenator Tamano is there time people are worried that September sixteen is about a little more than two weeks away\n\n\nIs there time for a real intelligent discussion of all of the issues here\n\n<$E> \n\nI don't think the uh there is time enough\n\n\nAnd that is really the problem\n\n\nWe have so little time\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$E> \n\nNow we have so little time but there is no preparation for the eventuality that the Americans will really leave come September seventeen\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$E> \n\nWe have not even passed the uh bases conversion uh authority uh bill\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$E> \n\nSo what we are creating here is a vacuum and that is one of the main reasons why I am for the ratification of this treaty\n\n\nWe need a breathing spell in order to prepare for the reality of the Americans leaving because there is no doubt that these Americans will leave\n\n\nBut let us be prepared for it\n\n\nWe are not prepared now especially because of Mount Pinatubo\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\nSenator Pimentel does the shortness of the time make any difference to the antis <unclear> words </unclear> too much\n\n\nWould it be any would it be any different\n\n<$C> \n\nWell, the difference would be in the fact that uh the bases agreement will be scrutinized to the minutest detail\n\n\nAnd all the pros and the cons of the argument will be brought out\n\n\nBut the whole trouble is precisely uh a couple of days ago Rene and I stood on the floor of the Senate asking precisely when are we going to receive a copy of this uh proposed agreement considering that even the the most  insignificant bill before the Senate takes uh days if not weeks\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$C> \n\nTo pass\n\n<$A> \n\nSo is there a real possibility that at the end of this period there will be no action by the Senate\n\n<$C> \n\nThat 's a distinct possibility\n\n\nAnd probably in the sense of uh just returning the document\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\n Nandoon naman sa Manglapus-Schultz na  a committee will be formed\n\n\nAnd I understand the President is selecting the members of the committee\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nFor the orderly withdrawal\n\n\n Diyan puwedeng ipasok kung ipa-  privatize  na ba 'yan dahil  one of the more onerous conditions  nga sa nangyayari ngayon  PHILSECO cannot even repair uh Soviet vessels  'no  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnyway  itong mga  intrusions into our sovereignty\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n<$B> \n\n Samantalang kung ma-  privatize  na 'yan ay dahil  to me  itong  asset  na ito 'no na  declining  kuno  cannot really be duplicated elsewhere\n\n\nSo I don't believe that the Americans will really leave all that quickly\n\n\nIn other words uh probably what they will do is work for the election of a pro-bases President and a pro-bases Senate\n\n\nSo  ano bang mangyayari diyan dahil may  special relationship  daw tayo  \n\n\nWill it be very bitter and permanent\n\n\nWill it be some kind of a lovers ' quarrel  na  after a short period they 're back in bed but under more honorable conditions\n\n\nYou know everything is possible  pero 'yon nga  it 's not as if  binomba ka na Iraq o Vietnam o Afghanistan  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOr Cuba\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n E hindi naman ganoon ang mangyayari diyan e  meaning it 's localized  'no  we suffer  'no  with our brothers and sisters  'no  \n\n\nOf course in Clark well the good Lord Himself liquidated the problem\n\n\n Pero sa Subic ito ang pinag-uusapan natin ngayon  \n\n\nThere is a chance for orderly withdrawal\n\n\nAnd whether I like it or not whatever we do now can be undone\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIn a few months uh uh by President Pimentel or whoever  \n\n\nI mean uh nothing is ever permanent  naman diyan eh  \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay now so  let 's talk about what the positions of the Senators are\n\n\nSenator Osme&ntilde;a for example in your case you are for the ratification of this uh particular bases agreement\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nWhat are the principal reasons why you are in favor of it\n\n<$D> \n\nWell the the most uh used reason that I have always advanced is the economic reason\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nThe repercussions upon our economy upon our stability upon the uh uh inflow of foreign investments that a withdrawal would bring about\n\n\nAnd I am using this because this is the understandable\n\n\nThis is the stomach\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nThe issue\n\n<$A> \n\nThe gut issue\n\n<$D> \n\nThe gut issue\n\n\nBut there are other issues  'no  \n\n\nThere 's the issue of the security of the ASEAN and the Pacific and our role in the family of nations\n\n\nThere 's the issue of uh whether or not we will isolate ourselves and withdraw\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nUh there are the there is the issue of the support for our local military which I think is a real issue\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nBecause our military is by the by the testimony of our own military leaders are saying that uh the military 's uh capabilities will drastically collapse if   the  uh support of the United States is removed\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$D> \n\nSo these are the these are the other issues\n\n\nNow in the course of the debate uh those of us who are the ones who are in favor have allowed those who are against particularly you know uh Abueva and a bunch of U P professors put out an ad in the papers which really angers

{"text": "<$A> \n\n Magandang tanghali ho sa inyong lahat ito na naman tayo sa Talakayan ng Bayan \n\n\nNgayon kasama po natin si Secretary Monsod ano po\n\n\nUh siya naman po ang magpapaliwanag kung totoo 'tong mga sinasabi nila na malaki ang mawawala sa ating, sa ating bayan pag nawala po itong mga U S bases ano po  particularly  'yong mga sinasabi nilang  economic benefits  na nabanggit ni Congressman Guerrero kanina  \n\n\nUh Mrs Monsod uh uh can you explain to us uh what this uh  these economic benefits that 's supposed to be can be derived from the bases and how it will effect how it will actually affect our uh country\n\n<$B> \n\n Oo  uh before we go into that yeah I 'd just like to comment Rod  'no  that you said that you talked about the military implications last week and now we 're talking about the economic implications\n\n\nI think that those are not the only considerations with respect to the bases that must be brought into account\n\n\nIt is also political considerations especially since our military considerations are a little uh overblown already since because the end of the Cold War uh the the this need this tremendous need to keep a security umbrella over the Pacific has lost a lot of its importance  'no  \n\n\nNow we 're talking about the economic implications and whenever you talk about the economic implications  kailangan ilalagay natin lahat ng benifisyo lahat rin ng mga  costs  'no  \n\n\nAnd uh Congressman Guerrero listed down the supposed economic  benefits including by the way development assistance and food aid and loans from multilateral organizations and these indeed must be must be said immediately to the public that uh just because we want or the bases go out does not mean that we are saying that we do not want to be friends with the United States\n\n\nLet us make that distinction very clear\n\n\nNow these economic benefits are overblown simply because whether or not the bases are there these  part of these benefits a great part of these benefits are going to be forthcoming anyway\n\n\nWhy do I say that simply because  sangkatutak na  country  naman sa buong mundo na walang  bases agreement with the United States  e merong silang  food aid  meron silang  development assistance  meron silang  uh uh uh garment quotas  etcetera etcetera   'no  \n\n\nSo that has nothing to do with the withdrawal or the retention of the bases\n\n\nWhat is directly attributable to the bases as far as economic benefit is concerned is the economic support fund base-related because there is non-base-related economic support fund\n\n\nAlright base-related economic support fund and your foreign military financing that is two hundred three million dollars a year and that presumably will be lost alright\n\n\nNow okay uh what will be gained  at uh ano pa ang sinasabi nila ang sinasabi ni Congressman Guerrero eh itong katakut-takot na dami ng ng   employees  sa  bases that will be dislocated plus the plus the indirect benefits of the purchases the local purchases of those bases\n\n\nUh that 's all very well and good, now we will say it 's going to be lost if, the moment those bases go vacuum  na 'yan  \n\n\nThat thing is going to be wasteland\n\n\nNow Subic has one of the unique qualities in this world\n\n\nIt 's got a natural deep port which makes the potential of this resource tremendous especially uh at the brink of what we call the Asia Pacific age alright\n\n\nIn other words uh the uh world has agreed it is universally agreed that come the twenty-first century and even now that the hub of economic activity is going to be in the Asia Pacific region\n\n\nRight, and we have to be prepared for that and Subic is one of the biggest natural resources that we have\n\n\nAnd that 's why the Americans want it so badly natural deep port  etcetera  \n\n\nSo if we now take into consideration that there is going to be an alternative use to these bases and that has been the subject of tremendous studies by the legislative executive bases council then we must take into account that there is going to be investment pouring in to that area which will create employment which will create income  etcetera  \n\n\nSo  anong pinag-uusapan natin ang  bottomline  natin  \n\n\nCertainly there is going to be dislocation at the beginning when there is withdrawal these people are going to lose their jobs right\n\n\nHowever we must also understand that the infrastructure expenditures and the investments that are going into Subic is going to make up for that\n\n\nAs a matter of fact according to the to the bases conversion study uh uh by nineteen ninety-five there will be even more people employed in the Subic area if uh the uh investments uh take place alright private sector as well as public sector investments\n\n\nSo in the final analysis therefore there is certainly going to be pain no change is made without pain but if we do not uh accept some pain for the greater good later on then there are so many things that we will not do\n\n\nI mean you know if a pregnant mother decides she does not want to have a baby because it 's going to be painful isn't that rather stupid\n\n\n Hindi ba  because we forget that the benefits of the alternative use of those bases\n\n<$C> \n\nWhat what you 're trying to say here uh Secretary Monsod is that the world the world market forces will overwhelm the American withdrawal the temporariness of the vacuum to be created by the withdrawal of the Americans\n\n\nIn other words uh there there is a theory here that if the Americans withdraw there is gonna be a a a rather significant diminution in the economic situation of the country because the dollars that are also coming in now are now removed\n\n\n  What you 're saying here now  that\n\n<$B> \n\n Wait wait wait   \n\n\nWhat do you mean significant diminution\n\n\nTwo hundred million dollars is not a significant   diminution  \n\n<$C> \n\n That 's not the point   \n\n\nYou were you were saying on the other hand that uh in the totality of this whether or not the bases are there  darating din naman 'yan mga 'yang mga  \n\n<$B> \n\nUh no no no uh if the bases are there then the alternative use of Subic cannot be made\n\n\nIn other words we will have to wait ten years before we start trying to get to develop the potential of Subic as a uh uh maritime industrial complex ship repair complex shipbuilding complex the tourism complex  etcetera  \n\n\nYou know as a as a hub for container uh trade\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah uh  how does how does it compete with the inter-ports of Singapore and Hong Kong and   uh Japan  \n\n<$B> \n\n Well I will   tell you something\n\n\nUh you know Subic has something that Singapore and and Hong Kong does not have and that is that deep water bay\n\n\nAnd the the point is that if you are going to wait ten years before you start developing it  eh baka mahuli ka na sa sa labanan hindi ba  \n\n\nThat is as far as the economic side is and I you know I it it distresses me that uh you know in this entire debate everybody is talking about the economic benefits of the bases right and have rather exaggerated these economic benefits and have even included such things as my goodness if the bases go  wala na tayong  sugar quota  wala na tayong  garment quota  wala na tayong    lintsak naman ano  hindi naman puwede 'yon  \n\n\nI mean I mean if if you know  magkakaroon tayo ng   coup   magkakaroon  you know we will be uh unprepared militarily\n\n\nYou know Rod the bases have been here well since uh since early the beginning of this century and uh since nineteen forty-seven since uh our independence\n\n\nThe  the the Americans have supposedly been equipping the  the Philippine Army and yet we have the most ill-equipped\n\n\nPlease tell me why we think that in the next ten years with this one hundred million we are now going to be tremendously equipped\n\n<$A> \n\nWell uh Secretary you mentioned the investments  'no  that are expected to flow into the the Subic area when the bases uh is withdrawn\n\n\nBut uh well according to some businessmen the precisely uh foreign investments come into the Philippines because of the presence of these   uh military bases  \n\n<$B> \n\n I have heard absolutely   I have seen absolutely no basis for that assertion\n\n\nAs a matter of fact when investors before were asked whether the bases had anything at all to do with their decision they said you know they don't care\n\n\nI mean do you do you think that the I mean why are the investors going to Thailand  eh wala namang  bases  ang  Thailand\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah that 's right\n\n<$B> \n\n E saksakan pa ng dami mas mas marami pang  investments  sa Thailand kesa sa Pilipinas  \n\n\n O kung sa Indonesia man lang walang  bases  doon  \n\n\nI mean you know just because these things may happen after the bases are withdrawn does not mean that it should it happens because the bases are withdrawn  'no  \n\n\nNumber one uh because if we use that kind of logic Rod that means that  teka muna  we 've had seven coup attempts we 've had political instability we 've had an ill-equipped army and the bases were here\n\n\nDoes that mean that all these things happened because the bases are here\n\n\nThat 's the same kind of stupid logic that leads us to the to the to the conclusion that if the bases are gone all these things are going to happen all these bad things are going to happen\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay uh  we 'll uh we 'll continue to discuss this with Secretary Monsod uh after a few reminders okay  \n\n\nWe are back on \"  Talakayan  \" and uh this is where we bring to you the Chairman of the Confederation of Sugar Producers Association of the Philippines and he is of course uh Mr Jomari Montinola\n\n\nNow uh Mr Montinola as we discuss the economic dimensions of the uh bases treaty I 'm sure that the sugar industry which is one of the major industries of this country would would have to be affected one way or the other\n\n\nHow do you assess this situation\n\n<$D> \n\nWell Rod uh we in the industry is worried about possible effects of the removal of the bases here\n\n\nIf we consider that twenty percent of our production sugar production go to the U S okay twenty percent of our sugar production go to the U S for our sugar quota okay\n\n\nThere are approximately six million Filipinos six million Filipinos dependent on the industry nationwide from up north in Cagayan down to Davao  'no  \n\n\nIf we lose twenty percent of our quota twenty percent of our production which is the U S quota this would translate to approximately one million Filipinos that will be retrenched that will have to be laid off, okay so you can can you imagine the the economic uh dislocation that will happen in the countryside if these people will lose their jobs\n\n\nWe 're worried about the peace and order situation, that will result as because of this economic dislocation\n\n\nWell you have also to consider that uh, the industry contributes approximately uh twenty billion pesos to the gross national product\n\n\nThe total investment in the sugar mills and the sugar facilities as is approximately sixty billion pesos\n\n\nCan you imagine and the taxes that we pay\n\n<$A> \n\nUh Mr Montinola I have a follow-up question to that in reaction to that  'no  \n\n\nAssuming we lose a portion of the U S sugar quota can we not look for alternative markets to make up for the loss in the U S market\n\n<$D> \n\nWell the U S market is a premium market at this time\n\n\nIt pays triple the the world market price\n\n\nThere is no way that we can sell our excess sugar to the world market\n\n<$A> \n\nNow uh how is the behavior of the the sugar uh uh industry today considering that there has been a play of the world prices of uh sugar these days\n\n\nIs it in the up trend or low low low trend or is it uh on an even keel at the moment\n\n<$D> \n\nYou know in Thailand in Thailand uh the local sugar price is being protected by government policy which is approximately three times as much as Philippine sugar\n\n\nThat 's why that 's the reason why the Thailand sugar can afford to sell this sugar at the world market even at a loss because they have already recovered their cost in the domestic market\n\n\nIn in our case we are not subsidized by government\n\n\nWe don't get any subsidy from government so we cannot afford to dump our sugar into the world market simply because the world market is is a market wherein all surplus and excess sugar are dumped by the producing countries\n\n<$A> \n\nUh how how 's the how 's the price now are you still a beleaguered industry as it was in the uh time of the previous uh regime\n\n<$D> \n\nWell the industry has started to recover the the plunder of the past regime and uh we would I I in five years we would be able to fully recover uh from that\n\n<$C> \n\nRod let me ask uh one more question in relation to the bases\n\n\nUh from from the point of view of the business sector  'no  uh in all the welter of opinions that have come out regarding the retention of the bases is the business sector really for or against uh the retention of the bases\n\n<$D> \n\nWell uh we came out the other day in an open letter to our good Senators that we 're supporting the bases\n\n\nWe in the sugar industry uh came out already with our own resolution supporting the the stay the ratification of the treaty\n\n<$A> \n\nNow uh Congressman Guerrero uh yeah he is planning to say more about uh the advantages and the disadvantages\n\n<$D> \n\nOne last question Rod uh probably uh one point\n\n\nIs uh if uh they don't want the bases here in in Luzon we can invite them into Negros\n\n\nWe have a deep water port in Negros Southern Negros which can develop the economy further in Negros\n\n<$A> \n\nThat reminds me of uh you 're in competition with Ali Dimaporo because he wants them in Mindanao as well  \n\n\nNow let 's let 's listen to Congressman Guerrero", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "40dfd01c-283a-40ec-b46c-962019cbc4ec", "added":

right\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's right\n\n\n<unclear> words </unclear> the capital goes\n\n<$B> \n\nAll right joining us in this segment is Joey Cuerdo\n\n\nHe 's the owner of Power Up Center for Climbing and Fitness and says friendship and family relationship should be given priority instead of business \n\n\nUhm also joining us is Genevieve Lim\n\n\nShe 's the owner of Zagu and says it 's better to avoid friends and relatives as business partners \n\n\nUh and then we have William Leung owner of <unclear> word </unclear> Restaurant\n\n\nIt 's very good restaurant by the way\n\n<$C> \n\nThank you\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd says the business should be kept within intermediate uh immediate family members only \n\n\nAnd then also joining us is Robert Francisco owner of Figaro\n\n<$D> \n\nGood evening\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay uhm your your business\n\n\nIs it because of the nature of your business\n\n\nIt 's a restaurant right\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nYou try to keep the recipes within   the  family\n\n<$C> \n\n Secret   \n\n\n  Yes  \n\n<$A> \n\n Oh okay   \n\n<$C> \n\nIt 's secret\n\n<$A> \n\nSo that 's that 's like  Tan Long  in in in San Francisco\n\n\nIt 's only the grandmother who knows\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAside from that is it is that is that the only advantage of keeping\n\n<$C> \n\nUh, aside from that uh we do keep uh, yeah the secret is uh it 's within the family\n\n<$A> \n\nYou also underpay your relatives  \n\n<$C> \n\nI hope not  \n\n\nThey would rebel\n\n<$B> \n\nUh what do you think uhm we we all know that after Zagu a lot of other different kinds of pearl shakes have you know gone all over the place\n\n\nIt 's really become a phenomenon but that 's because uh you broke up with your business partners\n\n\nRight\n\n\nAnd then they set up their own\n\n<$E> \n\nYeah but besides them opening up there are a lot of people who got into it because of the fact that I guess investment is pretty small   returns  are good and it 's pretty easy to set up\n\n<$B> \n\n Right   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$E> \n\nSo a lot of people got into it you know having that thought in mind\n\n<$B> \n\nBut is it is it uhm you don't recommend it to uh start a business with friends   or relatives  \n\n<$E> \n\n Well from   my experience\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom your experience\n\n<$E> \n\nYeah then I 'm gonna say \" no \" \n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$E> \n\nBut it can work out for other people\n\n\nBut I think in general I mean I 've been hearing it even before I got into business, not to get into business with friends\n\n\nBut I never believed it\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd in some ways someone has to go through it in order to believe it\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat what exactly happened uh with with uh your situation and your   business  \n\n<$E> \n\n I guess   it 's just differences uhm uh it 's just difficult if people don't wanna you gotta have an open mind hear people out uhm willing to uh hear like constructive criticisms   and  and move on\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$E> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd Joey you you you uhm actually have a business with  with your wife right\n\n<$F> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nYou started out five years ago\n\n\nRight\n\n<$F> \n\nUh yeah but prior to that uh we were already in business\n\n\nUhm after college when we went to uh\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat kind of business is this\n\n<$F> \n\nModules hand-outs\n\n<$A> \n\nOh okay\n\n<$F> \n\nUh we we went into that right after college\n\n\nAnd prior to that we were together for a while so when we went into business it wasn't really\n\n<$G> \n\nSo difficult   <unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n<$F> \n\n Yeah to get to know   yeah uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nOf course you started with with your wife because well you know you both would have the same risks\n\n\nYou don't have to pay each other anything  until the thing finally takes off <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$G> \n\nNo salaries\n\n<$F> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nYes when you start a business it 's like that\n\n<$B> \n\nBut what about when you when you I mean like every couple has their you know ups and downs right\n\n\nAnd when you have your downs isn't that difficult having a business together\n\n\nOr is it because is is it more like a like your baby together that you have to really just put your differences aside   and and  be business partners\n\n<$F> \n\n No   \n\n\nUhm well in our case because both of us are kind of strong uh strong headed\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$F> \n\nThe when one believes in the other and  e e  sometimes we really end up uh arguing and it 's hard because like what um Teddy said uh when she knows this half of the business and I know this half and we don't agree and we go uh you know we decide to to go   separate directions  \n\n<$E> \n\n Separate directions   \n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> advantages that you can really shout at each other argue like hell but you know that neither of you is gonna break up the business\n\n<$F> \n\nOh yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause it 's your future is there\n\n<$F> \n\nYeah  oo  \n\n<$A> \n\nSo probably with a with a stranger you can't be as open\n\n<$F> \n\nThat 's true\n\n<$B> \n\nI think that 's true\n\n<$F> \n\nI believe also that uh constant  arguments or debates really opens up books\n\n\nAnd you can see all sides of the the the coin and maybe just not two sides but even the circular side of it\n\n\nYou can really screen out and you know dig up all the flaws and\n\n<$A> \n\nIf you 're relatives\n\n<$F> \n\nRight\n\n\nAnd you you know it 's okay to really open up\n\n<$B> \n\nSo like like S M Robinsons Rustans like these are big the the these are family-owned businesses   as well  \n\n<$G> \n\n Right correct   \n\n<$B> \n\nUh well that does it mean it 's better to start your business with with family so that you end up being a big corporation like that I mean really successful like that\n\n<$D> \n\nIt 's easy to keep the secret inside   actually  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   uh okay\n\n<$D> \n\nBecause you become very protective and you only share probably what what uh my uh seatmate over here would say they keep the secrets to what they really want\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd let out only what has to be let out\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd therefore if it 's a family corporation you sometimes really can control\n\n\nThere are some bad sides here that you become extra-emotional when you make decisions\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nBut then again like you said I think earlier when you 're more of a powerful corporation you can easily buy or hire a professional manager\n\n<$A> \n\n But don't\n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nBut don't you find that that uhm there 's also a limited range of of ideas and and and you know   when you feel the idea  needs to evolve\n\n<$C> \n\n Actually   \n\n<$B> \n\nWhen it 's with the family\n\n<$C> \n\nThere is always a clash of ideas\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's all the same people\n\n<$C> \n\n'Cause like like us we are brothers and sisters uh so we have the same ideas but different application\n\n\nSo that 's why we always clash\n\n\nBut you know it 's good in the end that you find you find comfort that you you still have a brother and a sister with you to run the business\n\n<$A> \n\nYou didn't start the business with uh with family right\n\n\nYou started with friends\n\n<$E> \n\nI started with friends yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd uhm did you think it was uhm necessary to start first with friends even if you had bad experiences later on\n\n\nYou couldn't have done it without friends\n\n<$E> \n\nWell I think I could have but ideally I wanted to work with my friends\n\n\nYou know work together be all in one place and\n\n<$A> \n\nPut in the long hours in the beginning\n\n<$E> \n\nRight yeah but uhm it just didn't work out the way I wanted it to be and instead of prolonging it when we realized that we couldn't work together we just had to part ways rather than going on and then you know I believe you have to whatever you feel say it\n\n\nDon't keep it in your like don't keep it and let it build up inside\n\n\nYou have to express how you feel\n\n<$A> \n\nBut   but when you had  when you had this business with friends you owned the entire company then\n\n<$E> \n\n Open communication   \n\n\nNo I didn't\n\n<$A> \n\nYou did not\n\n<$E> \n\nNo uh\n\n<$A> \n\n  You had to buy them out  \n\n<$B> \n\n You had to buy  \n\n<$E> \n\n I had to buy them out   later on\n\n\nIt was offered to me just because I was the one who brought back the idea and they feel they have to offer it to me first\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$E> \n\nBefore like it 's offered to someone else\n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n<$D> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you have that in an in an agreement you know uh pre-emptive right\n\n<$E> \n\nUhm not   really  \n\n<$A> \n\n <unclear> words </unclear>   \n\n<$E> \n\nIt was just an understanding\n\n\nWe had a meeting we called a meeting and they all agreed that I think it 's best that it was offered to me 'cause I owned like majority of the the corporation yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$E> \n\nFifty percent so\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat about like uh drawing the line when does that like family businesses how do you do that\n\n\nWith you have a restaurant and it 's all your brothers and sisters\n\n\nThey 're running it\n\n\nI mean is it easy to fight with them because they 're your brothers and sisters\n\n<$C> \n\nYes when we were young our our parents instilled in them that I should be the\n\n<$B> \n\n  The  kuya    \n\n<$C> \n\n I 'm the   eldest right\n\n\nSo when arguments arise you know they would in the end they would respect my opinion\n\n\nAnd it it it works out that way\n\n<$A> \n\nI guess most of the quarrel is whether to expand or it 's a good thing let 's not lose let 's not put in any more money to expand   it and then lose it all  \n\n<$E> \n\n Actually the fight normally   starts either when you 're losing money or when you 're earning too much money\n\n\nThat 's where the differences come in\n\n<$G> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay well we 're gonna take a break here on Points of View\n\n\nStay tuned\n\n\nWe 'll be right back  \n\n\nOkay welcome back to \" Points of View \" \n\n\nThe question that we 're gonna ask in this segment is why is it that  Pinoys  love to get into business first with family and friends\n\n\nWhy why why do they need to have these people around them\n\n\nWhat do you think it is\n\n\nYou have a business with your friend right\n\n<$D> \n\nFamily\n\n<$B> \n\nFamily   also  \n\n<$D> \n\n Right   \n\n<$B> \n\nI thought it was your it 's not with friends   only  family\n\n<$D> \n\n No   \n\n\nFamily\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$D> \n\nWell our reason is probably because of security comfort and you know you don't wanna make your mistakes\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd it 's so much easier to correct your mistakes among family uh you know\n\n<$G> \n\nNow how many how many people in your family is part of the business\n\n\nAre all your brothers do you have brothers and sisters\n\n<$D> \n\nWe have seven partners are all related\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$G> \n\nUh so they 're not all immediate\n\n<$D> \n\nNo\n\n<$G> \n\n Pinsan  \n\n<$D> \n\nDirect direct\n\n<$G> \n\nDirect\n\n<$D> \n\nUh first cousin like two first cousins and uh three direct my brother and my sister and the rest are\n\n<$G> \n\nAnd are there any brothers and sisters you have there that are not a part of it\n\n<$D> \n\nYes\n\n<$G> \n\nWhy why didn't you uh <unclear> words </unclear> you know\n\n<$D> \n\nBy the time we incorporated the the the caf\u00e9 or the store Figaro\n\n\nTwo of them were not in the country then\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nIt was just us you know\n\n\nWe had a very very bonded family barbecue every Sunday so\n\n<$G> \n\nBut did you ask them to join in this thing you know\n\n<$D> \n\nUhm they 're most welcome when we have some expansion program we invite them first and foremost\n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n\nOkay\n\n<$D> \n\n  They get first  option of course\n\n<$B> \n\n Well that 's good   \n\n\nThat 's good\n\n\nUhm how about with your wife\n\n\nAre are there any other people in your business   now involved  \n\n<$F> \n\n Well actually   we hired a lot of friends\n\n<$B> \n\nFriends   okay  \n\n<$F> \n\n Uh   from school and uhm I think we got them because uh well our business it requires a lot of uh\n\n<$G> \n\nSkills\n\n<$F> \n\nUh skill and the people we needed their skill actually who were we used to climb with\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$F> \n\nWhen we were in college\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\nBut what happens if you if uh you know you get into have a falling out and something like that and uhm you need to fire someone that 's in your business\n\n<$F> \n\nActually uh we 've gotten close to that already\n\n<$B> \n\nUh   yeah  \n\n<$F> \n\n A   very good friend uh uh actually the first option that we had was uh not fire but uh lie low\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$F> \n\nUhm save the friendship\n\n\n  It was  actually uh it was actually a move to to save what we used to cherish in the day you know\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$G> \n\nOr if it 's an employee he 's out when you <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$F> \n\nYeah because someone you just someone who hired  uh someone who applied actually for a job\n\n<$G> \n\nSo what happened\n\n\nSo what happened after\n\n\nI   mean after  he lied low\n\n<$F> \n\n It was   \n\n\nUh it was painful\n\n\n Mga matagal na  \n\n\nWe had a big debate\n\n<$G> \n\nSo are you saying like  pare  you should resign or something like that\n\n<$F> \n\nNo no  \n\n<$G> \n\nNo but but it 's normally the way it happens  'pag  among  kaibigan  \n\n\nYou normally ask the closest friend to talk to him\n\n<$F> \n\nYeah\n\n<$G> \n\nAs a warning\n\n<$B> \n\n Oo  \n\n<$D> \n\nThen you know eventually if it still persists then you know you tell him the board is already recognizing your flaws for example then you know as a warning you know already\n\n<$G> \n\nBut should it happen\n\n\nDo you give do you give more chances\n\n<$B> \n\nIs it hard to\n\n<$G> \n\nBut do you give more chances\n\n<$D> \n\nOh yeah\n\n<$E> \n\nYeah\n\n\nYou give more considerations\n\n<$G> \n\nYou give third fourth fifth chance\n\n<$D> \n\n  Super  lenient\n\n<$E> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\nBut I wanna ask you this is it hard to uhm okay fine you have the these uh warnings or whatever right\n\n\nUhm you give memos out also you do that I mean\n\n<$D> \n\nNo no no not among directors\n\n\nI suppose you don't do that\n\n\nBut normally in  meeting\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nWhat I would probably anticipate is you know you open up and put out your mistakes or you lay out this happened in this outlet this is what 's happening right now in the in the business and\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nWe see that there 's a a weak point here and of course who 's responsible for this", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL",

{"text": "<$A> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> two hours from Manila two hours from Cebu two hours by travel from Davao and Zamboanga\n\n\nSo now we are able to prioritize and uh sort of uh veer off from the traditional shotgun type of development okay\n\n\nWe 're developed everywhere but not really anywhere\n\n<$B> \n\nI I just wanted to find out when you uh have identified each development area uh have you already come up with uh specific activities towards the development of each of these areas\n\n<$A> \n\nWe agreed and this was uh upon the recommendation of the planners that we should focus and come up with models\n\n\nSo in the case of Davao of the Mindanao cluster we have  identified an area in Samal Island as the ideal place to set up an example\n\n\nAnd this is the the Samal Island Resort Estate Company\n\n\nThat is what we would like to see in the next couple of months  'no  \n\n\nAnd this is also true in the case of uh of <unclear> word </unclear>  \n\n<$C> \n\nAir resort or tourism estate similar to the industrial estate being promoted by government involves the purchase and infrastructure development and incentive programs development by the government\n\n\nFor sale to private investors of large tracts of land\n\n\nFor resort building\n\n\nThe advantage of the resort estate concept is that it removes stumbling blocks for prospective tourism investors\n\n<$A> \n\nThe idea is for us to buy it first\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then put the initial land development like roads  'no  \n\n\nWith the help of course of D P W H\n\n\nAnd then set up the communication system with the help of D O T C\n\n\nAnd in the case again of Samal we 're working with the Regional Development Council\n\n\nWe have tracked down what are the programmed infrastructure activities that are scheduled there and so we 're trying to push that faster  'no  \n\n<$B> \n\nSo I have gone over the details of the cluster development \n\n\nI think it 's just uh it 's okay\n\n\nIt 's a very good uh grouping actually because especially in the long term with the objective of each cluster\n\n\nLike they have Luzon for the multifaceted uh aspects of tourism and Visayas as a resort center and Mindanao for the culture\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd so on\n\n\nI think it 's a very good <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n\nBut what I would really like to see I wonder if it 's at all possible to prioritize certain aspects of the development or to expedite all of the airports that we 've targeted for improvement which is the San Fernando La Union Airport\n\n\nUh a few months ago we uh approached uh Secretary Estanislao for funding support uh and uh he gave us his uh whole-hearted approval \n\n\nAnd he intends to secure funds from the Philippine aid plan\n\n\nThe upon completion of the uh widening and lengthening of the San Fernando La Union Airport uh we would now have the opportunity to bring in uh two inclusive air charters from uh our target markets in East Asia like Korea Japan Hong Kong uh and Singapore\n\n\nUh especially those markets who would like to have the uh the uh beaches of uh Ilocos and the uh the mountain air of the Cordilleras\n\n\nWell uh in addition to the San Fernando La Union airport uh we have uh through the P T A uh set aside uh uh about two hundred fifty million pesos for the improvement of the Mactan International Airport\n\n\nUh it 's an integrated project that uh will require also funding from O E C F\n\n\nUh where we come in is in uh phase one of the project that calls for the uh uh, building of a new uh international terminal\n\n\nAnd uh based on uh current plans the uh the terminal will be open for business uh within uh a few months\n\n\nAnd the idea here is to ensure that uh uh we can accommodate uh uh more air traffic into Mactan International Airport and decongest in the process uh Ninoy Aquino International Airport where ninety-eight percent of the tourist traffic flows through at the present time\n\n<$D> \n\nThat 's true uh I 'll bring up the importance of gateway simply because I can immediately see two advantages of the master plan for the tour operators  'no  because the the these development areas immediately solve two problems of the operators here in the Philippines right now\n\n\nFirst of all the marketing thing we now can go into product enhancement product diversification and a whole lot of other product activities\n\n\nThen another one is operationally it solves our problem with the clogging and the crowding of Manila\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm\n\n<$D> \n\nSo it 's it becomes easy for us to work  'no  and operate our programs with different gateways  'no  \n\n<$E> \n\nHow many hotel rooms Mr Secretary, are slated to to be in the next uh let 's say six years ten years uh any figures any facts\n\n<$F> \n\nWe are calling for an additional uh thirty-three thousand rooms on top of the existing twenty-two thousand hotel and resort rooms throughout the country\n\n\nHowever of the thirty-three thousand uh roughly about sixteen thousand are now presently being uh built\n\n<$E> \n\nYes that 's right\n\n<$F \n\nSo uh we will probably we will still need an additional uh uh seventeen thousand rooms\n\n\nNow we believe that uh with uh increasing traffic flows into the country investments for additional accommodations will naturally follow\n\n\nA lot of them will be built outside of course there 's still room for uh for more hotels in Metro Manila\n\n<$E> \n\nOkay\n\n<$F> \n\nBut uh a a big percentage will be dispersed throughout the country\n\n<$E> \n\nTherefore uh we have now gateways we have hotel rooms trained people\n\n<$F> \n\nYes we will have regional training centers\n\n\nWe will have the uh the theoretical institutions as well as the on-the-job training institutions to support the uh the uh mother school \n\n<$E> \n\nRight\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nI would like to find out if there 's room in it for education\n\n\nWhen I say education it 's not the human resources development but education on the public and education of the other sectors of government about tourism\n\n\nBecause the master plan to succeed needs the cooperation of other government sector and also the support of the people\n\n\nAnd like you said uh earlier the everybody has the wrong concept that tourism is the frills thing industry\n\n\nThey overlook that it 's a very important economic activity\n\n\nWould the tourism master plan have a budget or allotment for the education of our, congressmen our senators or other cabinet members the public in general  \n\n<$F> \n\nYes the tourism master plan uh calls for a uh a an increase in uh the advertising and promotions budget\n\n\nUh that uh will include uh in the plan a tourism awareness campaign\n\n\nUh you 're right uh it 's very important for the general public at large to rally behind the tourism master plan because this plan is not government mandated\n\n\nIt 's it 's a plan that uh will ensure uh tremendous changes in the economic landscape that will benefit everybody in this country\n\n\nSo uh because of of the national interest uh it behooves all of us uh to rally behind this plan\n\n\nAnd to to do that it is important as you said uh for us to launch a systematic and methodical uh tourism awareness campaign\n\n\nFor example uhm it is critical to get our taxi drivers involved uh in uh in tourism development\n\n\nAll it takes is for a particular frontliner like a policeman like uh a taxi driver uh to to commit a misdemeanor against a tourist \n\n\nThat can destroy the the image of uh of uh the Philippines in the eyes of this tourist\n\n\nAnd the worst thing that can happen to a country is a negative word by mouth advertising or disadvertising\n\n\nUhm it 's important also for example to get our policy makers uh uh to understand the implications of the tourism master plan because uh in the process uh if they do not correct certain infirmities uh that exist today then it would be very very difficult for example to get our uh budgets uh synchronized uh and uh and uh integrated into the uh master plan\n\n\nLet us not forget that uh tourism is a very powerful economic tool\n\n\nAnd uh if I look and I 'm sure everybody in in the industry joins me in this view that uh uh tourism can be effectively used to alleviate poverty in the countryside\n\n<$E> \n\nOf course it will\n\n<$F> \n\nYet it can also assist in urban renewal because as more jobs are created in the end in the countryside then the decongestion of uh the urban areas especially Metro Manila can then take place\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay  \n\n\nA tourism development program such as that envisioned by the master plan naturally has wide ranging implications on transportation policy\n\n\nPrimarily aviation policies\n\n\nThis would necessarily involve the national carrier Philippine Airlines\n\n<$G> \n\nWell uh right now we would like to seek the help of the government the D O T in seeking more liberal uh arrangements with uh countries like Australia Japan Canada Italy Spain and  United Kingdom\n\n\nThese are our main sources of tourists\n\n\nAnd present uh air agreements with these countries are so restrictive that we could not grow any further\n\n\nTake the case of Japan\n\n\nRight now Philippine Airlines is already maximum using its maximum uh  uh  seats in Japan and yet Japan Airlines is only utilizing sixty percent of its uh potential of its rights\n\n\nAnd to think that uh ten million Japanese travel out of Japan every year\n\n\nWe are really only getting roughly about two percent of this ten million\n\n\nWe would want to tap that market\n\n\nIt 's so near to us but we would like the Philippine government to help us get these rights\n\n\nAnd then as far as uh charters are concerned Philippine Airlines would be uh supportive of these provided that these groups are really genuine chartered inclusive tour groups\n\n\nIn other words uh affinity affinity groups\n\n\nThey are residents and citizens of the foreign countries from way from where they originate\n\n\nAnd that they do not uh supplant the present scheduled air carriers from these countries\n\n\nLike say in the case of Japan Japan Airlines and Philippine Airlines\n\n\nUh we would like to see them and uh we would want them to supplement the present air scheduled services not supplant them\n\n\nNow we would like also to see the other airlines bring in more tourists to the Philippines\n\n\nI don't know whether any of you know that Philippine Airlines bring say one thousand seven hundred percent more Dutch than K L M\n\n\nWe bring four hundred percent more, British than  than British Airways\n\n\nWe carry we carried uh three hundred percent more Chinese than all that had been brought together by China Airlines Cathay Pacific and C A A C\n\n\nAnd surely uh we 've carried more Thais to the Philippines than Thai International\n\n\nSo when we grant these charters we must make sure that these are genuine tourists who are out to visit the country not Filipino workers from abroad\n\n\nBecause these workers our workers abroad are the they belong to the two carriers Philippine Airlines and the carrier of the country from where they originate\n\n\nWe must guard against uh alleged uh charters who say who will say that they will bring uh tourists from the Middle East and yet when you check the loads these are all returning overseas Filipinos or returning  balikbayans  from California or from the U S  \n\n<$C> \n\nSignificant changes in the existing international air transport policies are required including new civil aviation legislation and a more flexible interpretation of existing aviation policy\n\n<$F> \n\nTo begin uh we are opting for the liberalization of the uh approval of inclusive tour air charter uh operations to the Philippines\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay\n\n<$F> \n\nUh secondly we would like to see the opening up of inclusive tour air charter operations to airports outside outside of Manila and and Cebu\n\n\nThird I think it 's very important that the D O T regain its membership in the Civil  Aviation Board or Civil  Aeronautics Board\n\n<$C> \n\nWhat\n\n<$F> \n\nThe C A B for short\n\n\nUh about four years ago we gave up our membership there and uh and in the process we 've realized our uh our uh mistake\n\n<$C> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$F> \n\nUhm it 's important that uh the voice of tourism be heard in the Civil  Aeronautics Board\n\n\nUh and lastly uh we believe that uh the Civil Aviation Code needs to be revised\n\n\nIf I 'm not mistaken uh the existing code was drawn up in the early fifties and uh because of changes in uh the the world economy uh the way uh the way travel has developed and the importance today of tourism as uh an economic development tool it 's important that the code be revised to conform to the present uh situation and to anticipate future developments in tourism and travel\n\n\nUh today there is uh a House bill that uh attempts to uh revise the Civil Aviation Code \n\n\nThis is House Bill number two two nine nine four and we 're hoping that uh Congress approves this uh before uh before the end of their term  \n\n<$C> \n\nCan Philippine Airlines deliver the tourists that are envisioned to come in droves\n\n\nDoes Philippine Airlines have enough seats enough aircrafts enough flights\n\n<$G> \n\nYes", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f6fde9bd-e432-4aff-9273-0dd77c810b06", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.093170+00:00"}

will have a look again at so-called uh, surveys such as the Radio Veritas survey\n\n\nThey need to have a big big uh size and try to see really whether it 's accurate at all\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nThe Radio Veritas survey was predicting that a that Mr Cojuangco <unclear> 3 words </unclear>, for example\n\n\nIt 's not happening at all\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm but uh insofar as the uh surveys of the S W S are concerned they 're more or less accurate\n\n<$C> \n\nYes I would say\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nI would say I would say\n\n<$A> \n\nWell thank you very much gentlemen for uh having joined me in the panel tonight uh\n\n\nWe have other guests\n\n\nUh for example Secretary of Foreign Affairs Raul Manglapus will be uh called to the panel after this uh live report from Cebu City\n\n\nCome in Cebu  \n\n<$D> \n\nSo you 've mentioned earlier in the coverage uh the sample that we have the that the data that we have uh is uh because of limitations in transmission uh professing a very large urban bias\n\n\nWe broke down uh our data into uh regional sources and and we 've established that forty-nine point six percent of uh the numbers that we have are generated from the National Capital Region\n\n\nThat is the largest uh segment of uh of the sample data that we have\n\n\nAnd uh the second uh largest sample that we have comes from uh uh region six\n\n\nUh now the sample size that we have so far posted uh amounts to only about five percent of uh the total vote or less \n\n\nAnd it is insufficient to extrapolate from this sample considering the size of that sample and considering the variance in the representation of of the regions\n\n\nAlthough we do have uh samples from all the regions the sample sizes are not uh at all even\n\n<$E> \n\nYes and uh and we uh we are still trying to say that it 's too early to say that there 's any trend\n\n\nUh there are some uh who say that uh one candidate is leading uh by a big margin but uh again it 's too early to say that anybody is winning by that large a margin\n\n\nIn any event we 'd like to ask uh Secretary Ramos here uh how he feels about the conduct of the election in general\n\n\nUh what is his reaction\n\n<$F> \n\nI do believe that uh the May eleventh election was uh on election day one of the most peaceful and uh violence-free I mean comparatively speaking\n\n\nI 've been into many of these things in the past as a deputy of the Commission on Elections \n\n\nAnd uh, uh I am surprised uh as to how the level of violence was brought down and uh certainly the COMELEC uh its deputies the uh Philippine National Police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines the uh other deputized agencies the COMELEC volunteers the uh uh Pastoral Parish Council for Responsible uh Voting uh P P C R V uh as many as well as many others should be congratulated for uh a job well done\n\n\nHowever uh we 're now into phase two and uh this is the period where even greater frauds and anomalies can be perpetrated\n\n\nSince just by the stroke of one pen you can change the cipher at the end of a report or the number in front of a number\n\n\nAnd change uh the uh the totals significantly\n\n\nSo our people must continue to watch this\n\n\nThe old political pros are adept at this game and uh those of us who are into politics for the first time and who are also non-traditional uh would want that uh the entire process be kept as clean as uh credible and as orderly as possible\n\n<$D> \n\nUh Mr Secretary during the campaign there were a lot of scare scenarios being uh peddled by uh uh parties uh uh all over\n\n\nUh we 've had the a an  electoral process that uh uh defied the expectations as to peacefulness and turn-out and uh even the quickness of the count in spite of some delays\n\n\nUh how do you assess the uh the prospects for a continuation of this uh of this orderliness into the next few days\n\n<$F> \n\nWell I uh think that if we apply the continuous uh monitoring process that has already been started uh meaning that the people themselves through the uh people 's organizations the N G Os as well as uh us individuals continue to keep watch then uh I think this process can uh, be maintained as uh one that is really remarkable uh in nineteen ninety-two\n\n\nBut uh understand that uh as candidates find out that they are losing and have no more chances of catching up then they uh just fold up and they go home bringing with them the the poll watchers assigned to those precincts or to those uh uh municipal uh tally areas\n\n\nSo uh I would then recommend uh in fact appeal to uh the citizenry to maintain the watch because there are still many more days of this\n\n\nMedia also should be commended for uh for maintaining this sort of reportage because uh the people should be informed\n\n\nThis is part of the transparency also of the entire process\n\n<$E> \n\nSir as one of the front runners in this uh uh election uh that we just had how do you feel about the way the results are coming in\n\n\nUh is it still anybody 's ball game or is it yours\n\n<$F> \n\nUh-huh well uh of course there are many versions and we have a variety to choose from at any particular time\n\n\nUh which is good, \n\n\nUh in my particular case I uh, knew right away that uh the very first reports would come from Metro Manila and this happens to be the uh bailiwick of uh Miriam Santiago\n\n\nUh these facts were established in uh various surveys in the past\n\n\nSo we know more or less we know more or less the distribution of uh each one 's strengths in our fourteen regions\n\n\nIn my case uh I 'm running second to Miriam in the surveys in Metro Manila but I 'm seeing also that uh, the big difference which uh appeared in the surveys insofar as Metro Manila was concerned is not appearing in the tallies\n\n\nUh in other words I 'm gaining here in Metro Manila\n\n\nUh in one of the surveys uh Miriam was credited with some thirty-three percent of the possible vote in uh Manila but I had only seventeen percent\n\n\nBut in the actual tally so far uh she 's running at about twenty-eight percent and I 'm running at about twenty-one percent so that 's just seven percent difference\n\n\nMeaning I gained here\n\n<$D> \n\nWhich will you which will you consider your bailiwick uh   <unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n<$F> \n\n Well uh in the in the   previous surveys again and this is by S W S and \" Crystal \" which is our in-house survey uh I am running either one or two in all the fourteen regions\n\n\nUh but those that are especially strong for me include uh region one of course which uh of which Pangasinan my home province is a part\n\n\nUh the uh, the two Visayas regions region seven which is uh Lito Osme&ntilde;a 's home ground, and also region eight uh Samar Leyte plus uh, three out of the four regions in Mindanao where I, was running first but in the fourth one I 'm also running a close first or a close second there\n\n\nSo those are my bailiwicks roughly uh, six uh sure three regions\n\n<$D> \n\nWe we have a very very small sample from uh region one uh point one four percent uh due to some problems in transmission which will be corrected tonight\n\n\nUh but in the very very small sample that we have you ranked fourth uh uh in in the region one sample that we have\n\n\nIt 's too small of course\n\n<$F> \n\nWell I 'll tell you what I got from uh, some of our leaders in Pangasinan who called up this uh afternoon\n\n\nThey 're really working on a sample also because, uh they don't have uh the complete returns yet\n\n\nBut uh I am getting uh eighty percent of the vote there\n\n\nAnd I think this should be expected because uh   <unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n<$D> \n\n <unclear> words </unclear>   in Pangasinan is your biggest province\n\n<$F> \n\nWell it 's third really\n\n\nBut it has one point one million registered voters\n\n\nAnd assuming that eighty percent voted or turned out\n\n\nThen we have the potential of uh roughly uh eight hundred eight thousand votes\n\n\nSo it comes after uh Cebu and Negros Occidental\n\n<$E> \n\nSince Pangasinan is part of region one can your votes in Pangasinan uh overwhelm the votes in the Ilocos provinces\n\n<$F> \n\nOh yes because uh the combined votes of uh Ilocos Norte Ilocos Sur and La Union Abra is not considered to be a part of region one\n\n\nBut even if you throw Abra into region one although it 's part of the Cordillera Administrative Region a combined vote of those four provinces will not exceed those of uh Pangasinan alone\n\n\nUh in any case uh I am not uh I agree with Bong that uh at this early stage considering the sample which is about three or four percent  'no  \n\n\nUh this is not enough on which to base any trend much less the claim of victory uh\n\n\n Medyo malayo yata 'yon  \n\n\nAnd uh I think we should await uh as you said uh a greater number of votes as well as a more even distribution within the regions\n\n<$E> \n\nWe have always emphasized here at A B S C B N that uh our count is uh not producing a trend and uh and if people misread it it 's really their lookout you know\n\n\nI mean people like to see what they want to see\n\n\nAnd I understand some candidates are uh you know are so upset about how it 's going on\n\n\nBut uh but it 's it 's a question of uh you see what you want to see  \n\n<$F> \n\nJust relax and enjoy yourselves  \n\n<$E> \n\nAnother question that I have for you Mr Secretary is uh what are the lessons that you have learned in the campaign\n\n\nAre there some insights that will help you if and when you win this election\n\n<$F> \n\nWell I uh must uh consider this a very valuable learning experience\n\n\nGoing through the campaign for ninety days all over the country\n\n\nI think we missed uh just three provinces uh Batanes and Aurora although we had representatives from those provinces joining us\n\n\nUh there was one more province that uh oh just two because we visited uh Tawi-tawi\n\n\nBut uh to me the most uh valuable, insight uh could should be uh an important uh basis for action in the future so that we could provide some remedies is the continuous dependence of our ordinary people on a political patron\n\n\nHow even for the very small things our people in the rural areas especially seem to be uh so dependent on a recommendation from somebody that is important\n\n\nThat they uh seem to have lost all initiative of trying to lead themselves  'no  \n\n\nUh precisely this is what uh we are trying to to fight in our party and that is uh the situation of the ordinary Filipino continuing to be just a puppet or a pawn in the hands of uh the political uh masters in the community\n\n\nUh I just think that our ordinary people have the capability and the talent given some encouragement and some training and uh maybe some  credit assistance to grow up and themselves become uh self-reliant and productive uh uh economic uh components of our society\n\n<$E> \n\nThen will government will your administration give them the uh economic support to do this like credit\n\n<$F> \n\nYes uh that is what I call the second phase of the EDSA revolution which is the economic empowerment of our people\n\n\nThe political is finished and we should credit President Aquino for that plus all those that helped her\n\n\nBut uh certainly we should uh try to give supplemental income opportunities to our uh household for instance\n\n\nIt 's being done there in Negros Occidental\n\n\nUh I 've seen it", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source":

unhappy with it and so uh  I think we were celebrating our seventeenth or eighteenth anniversary\n\n\nAnyway kinda long right\n\n<$A>  \n\n\n   Uh-huh  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n And I    said hey Christian we gotta do something \n\n\nNot  naman  seventeen but but but  kuwan na rin  \n\n\nAnd I said Christian we gotta talk about this we 'll have to talk about this because I 've seen so many couples    that have  just sort of drift apart  sort of thing and the you know the husband fools around \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Marriages    \n\n<$B>  \n\nThat 's what it is\n\n\nMostly most most of the time it 's the husband fooling around\n\n\nAnd I said Christian we have been friends so long \n\n<$A>  \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B>  \n\nCan we just \n\n\nJust just get this and I said, until I 'm forty, you have, every opportunity\n\n\nI give you the permission to to fool around because until I 'm forty \n\n\nAnd he says why is that \n\n\nAnd I said it 's because until I 'm forty I have options  \n\n\nI mean you know\n\n<$A>  \n\nI was wondering\n\n<$B>  \n\n\n 'No  \n\n<$A>  \n\nOkay fine\n\n<$B>  \n\nI I I I want I I I have options\n\n<$A>  \n\nYou really did say that\n\n<$B>  \n\nOf course\n\n\nI    mean  \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Really    \n\n<$B>  \n\nWe are very we we were friends before we were lovers\n\n<$A>  \n\nI I know that\n\n<$B>  \n\nAnd uh you know I I wanted I I wanted to put it to him as like a friend you know don't betray me \n\n<$A>  \n\nBecause I have options \n\n<$B>  \n\nYeah yeah until I 'm forty I think I have options after I 'm forty I have no options so you can fool around until I 'm forty  \n\n\nAfter I 'm forty you have no right to fool around because I have no more options\n\n<$A>  \n\nOr else\n\n<$B>  \n\nDeal  'no  deal\n\n<$A>  \n\nOkay\n\n\nUh Liway\n\n<$C>  \n\nWell in my case I never gave him any option  \n\n<$A>  \n\nFrom the very beginning\n\n<$C>  \n\nYes\n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Talaga  \n\n<$C>  \n\nHe should know\n\n\nAnyway\n\n<$A>  \n\nYes\n\n<$C>  \n\nJust kidding aside well I thank God that in my case really uhm it was uh, not so much love at first sight but he 's really my first boyfriend    and  no one else\n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Talaga    \n\n\nBut Liway what if one day you find out that he has a mistress\n\n\nWhat would you do\n\n<$C>  \n\nWell I don't know\n\n\nI 'll kill the mistress probably  \n\n\nRetain him  no no\n\n<$A>  \n\nNo no what what if you find out    that  Christian is seeing someone\n\n<$C>  \n\n\n Uh    \n\n<$B>  \n\nWell I  I have a different perspective\n\n<$A>  \n\nWhat is that perspective\n\n<$B>  \n\nUh I 'd blame my husband\n\n\nThe mistress is totally irrelevant to me\n\n\nIt 's because it 's our relationship that that is at stake\n\n<$A>  \n\nWhose failure is that most of the time\n\n\nYou mentioned earlier husband fooling around\n\n<$B>  \n\n\n Eh wala na nga siyang  option because I 'm past forty  e    \n\n<$C>  \n\n\n Pero  \n\n<$A>  \n\nOkay Liway\n\n<$C>  \n\n\n Kami naman Boy ako naman  I 'm so secure\n\n\nUh let 's just say that I have uh really felt so good when we joined \" Couples for Christ \" \n\n\nUh\n\n<$A>  \n\nThat helped a lot\n\n<$C>  \n\nEleven years ago yes uh and uh that was the time when we were also brought into the marriage uh preparation uh program where we were conducting the uhm pre-Cana\n\n\nUh we we took a course on uh uhm  parang  guidance counselors  kami  \n\n<$B>  \n\nUhm\n\n<$C>  \n\nSo we would give seminars in \" Mary the Queen  \" preparing married couples    uh I mean uh  engaged couples to get married\n\n<$A>  \n\n\n   Pero  Liway in uh  oo      \n\n\nIn a few in a few lines Liway how does \" Couples for Christ  \" as an organization help uh married uh couples I mean couples\n\n<$C>  \n\nWell first of all we should believe in prayer\n\n\nWe should believe that there is a God who would help couples who are uhm focused on Him\n\n\nAnd uh because of this if, it has an uh first of all an effect on on your relationship  I don't know what happened but we have been more open communicating with each other and uh more than being open communicating with each other it 's as if we have become uh more romantic    more  \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n I will    debate that\n\n\nThat 's you\n\n\nBut what about couples who 've tried everything but things just wouldn't work out\n\n<$C>  \n\nBecause they are not uh surrendered to the Lord\n\n\nThat 's what I would say    and because  from the very beginning they did not find the probably the love that would strengthen their relationship\n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Uh-huh    \n\n<$B>  \n\nThey did not pray for passion  \n\n<$A>  \n\nWell we talked about  husbands fooling around\n\n\nMy question is this what if somebody comes to you goes to you and says and offers a proposal proposes\n\n\nAnd what if you discover one day that you have a child who is gay\n\n\nWhat would you do\n\n\nBut before you talk about being gay and uh indecent proposals you are part of this private conversation we 're having with  Mareng

many many projects\n\n\nWe started the coastal road\n\n\nIt 's now expanded to six lanes\n\n\nWe 've lighted it up\n\n\nUh the coastal road used to be a salvaging zone now peace and order\nprevails

are many things that have to be done to uh to make\ngovernment become more efficient\n\n\nAnd one of the things that you have to do is perhaps improve some\nof the laws   that  restrict government

\n\nUh what do you intend to do once you become a private citizen\n\n\n won't you miss the power you know\n\n\nNow you can uh order people to do this to do that things happen uh\nwith a snap of the fingers\n\n<$D> \n\nYeah actually  kasi  Jullie  ang\n\n orientation  natin nagsimula tayo sa  opposition\n\n na 'yon  \n\n\nThere was a time from nineteen seventy-eight to nineteen\neighty-four I quit my business and my job because I really went full time uh\nin organizing the opposition against the past regime\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\n So nakita ko nang kaya kong mabuhay sa sarili kong ano\nmaski na  underground economy  o maski  buy and sell\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nSo  wala na akong takot diyan\n\n\nKaya lang nakita ko rin itong kapangyarihan  once you 're\nin office  pala hindi mo naiisip ito dahil sa dami ng trabahong\nginagawa mo  it 's only when you reflect maybe after I get out of my\noffice that I will say to myself  uy ang lakas pala ng aking uh\npuwesto ang lakas ang dami ko palang kapangyarihan di ko nagamit  \n\n\n Pero  on the other hand  baka maipagmalaki\nko 'to sapagkat  no one in the family has even benefitted from that\npower that I am enjoying right now\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat about you General Manager Carrascoso why aren't you\nrunning\n\n\nYou look like uh you can tackle the work of Doc Carrascoso\n\n<$E> \n\nBasically Jullie my role in government is uh first of all\ncoterminous with the uh President Aquino\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\n\n\nAnd I gave myself four years to serve the government as if I was\ndrafted in the army\n\n\nThat 's about it\n\n\nI think uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYou 've had enough of us\n\n\nOr we 've had enough of you  \n\n\n\n\nWell I think uh we should we should uh lead a quieter life and\nprobably go back to the private sector and   <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n \n\n<$B> \n\n What is your biggest frustration   \n\n<$E> \n\nWell I think it 's it 's uh trying to please everybody\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd I think uh uh you can't do it\n\n\nAnd it 's a thankless job\n\n\nAnd basically I think uh I have done my part and uh if somebody if\nthey don't agree with some of my of my policies well I try to my best to\nserve\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\nI 've always said that anyone who can straighten out the\ninternational airport deserves to be President\n\n\nI don't know if you gentlemen agree but you know that airport is\nreally the heart of chaos, anarchy lack of order lack of discipline lack\nof planning\n\n\nYou know I 'm talking about the architectural uh requirements that\nare not there\n\n\nWe 're talking about water not being there\n\n\nWe 're talking about doors falling apart and people running in and\nout who should not be there\n\n<$E> \n\nUh by the way Jullie I 'm the only agency with water and and\npower all this   this time yeah  \n\n<$B> \n\n All the time  ha    you 're sure\n\n\nWell how did you how did you do that\n\n<$E> \n\nWell I planned it since last year that I knew that there\nwould be a lot of problems as far as water and uh power is concerned\n\n\nAnd we addressed this problem as early as last year\n\n<$B> \n\nHow did you ensure uh continuous power when the rest of Metro\nManila suffers three to four hour brownouts every day\n\n<$E> \n\nWell first of all they gave me a priority as far as this is\nconcerned\n\n\nBut uh there are  times that we have real emergency\npowers over there and uh all of our air-conditionings are now decentralized\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd so I think basically these are the uh the things that we\nhave done over the years\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd when I leave in June I 'll be leaving the the coffers of\nNAIA with one billion pesos\n\n<$B> \n\nOh that 's good\n\n\nNow in the meantime what can you say about Doc uh your brother\nseeking an elected office\n\n\n did your family have a meeting a council of some kind\n\n<$E> \n\nWell\n\n<$B> \n\nTo counsel him\n\n<$E> \n\nI found out that Docky was running when I was on my way back\nin Manila and I said well  it 's up to him if he thinks that he\ncan serve the country on a  on a different way and I think I wish\nhim luck\n\n\nAnd hopefully he will win\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n\nDid uh Doc didn't you try to get Ed to run also for some kind of\nan elected office\n\n<$F> \n\nUh what is that Jullie\n\n<$B> \n\nDidn't you try to get him to run\n\n<$G> \n\nOh no no no no\n\n<$B> \n\n  To convince him to run  \n\n<$G> \n\n Uh we do not try to   look into each other 's\nlives  'no   \n\n\nOur late father has taught us that way  'no  \n\n\nTo   leave each other in peace  and maybe we just get\ntogether when we, one is one has a problem or one needs help\n\n\nThat is the only time that we get together\n\n\nBut basically you 'll be surprised probably we don't see each\nother for about three four months\n\n<$B> \n\n To each his own   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n\nIs this politics in the blood for for some of you for the\nApacibles\n\n\nThis is your first time\n\n<$C> \n\nThis is my first time\n\n\nThe only other politician in the family was my great grandfather\nAgapito Zialcita\n\n<$B> \n\nWhom you you never saw\n\n<$C> \n\nWho was an original signatory to the Declaration of\nPhilippine Independence in eighteen ninety-eight\n\n\nAnd it stopped there\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$H> \n\nThe rest of the family are professionals doctors engineers\nand uh I 'm the only one who 's trying this new thing\n\n<$D> \n\nIn our case uh our late father was a congressman four-termer\nhe died in office\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$D> \n\nSo when he died uh  alam mo ganyan ang kaugalian e\nkung mapasimulan ng ama pag mamatay gusto 'yong  either  asawa\no anak e wala pa naman ako sa edad 'yong kapatid ko lang ang nasa edad kaya\nsiya ang lumaban ng  mayor  sa aming bayan  \n\n\nAnd I think he was a uh two termer there or something like that\n\n<$F> \n\nThree three\n\n<$D> \n\nThree terms yeah\n\n\nHe was one of the most outstanding uh mayors at that time\n\n<$B> \n\nBut but\n\n<$D> \n\nSo  nakasimula siya siya na ang nauna kaya ako medyo\nnag-  shift  na ng  career  e  \n\n<$B> \n\nBut to be frank  ano  isn't it nice to be just\na plain simple private citizen\n\n\nI mean is the power that you get worth the trouble you know being\nunable to sleep soundly people knocking on your door at five o' clock in the\nmorning people asking you for a job for money to bury the dead\n\n\nSonny you were a newspaperman\n\n\nTell me which part of your life did you enjoy most, being a\nnewspaperman or being the boss of the G S I S Manila Hotel

amount of black propaganda that has surfaced in recent days\n\n\nTonight uh to evaluate the campaign and the election in its final stages we have representatives of three leading Presidential contenders\n\n\nWe have Maribel Ongpin representing the People 's Reform Party and Miriam Defensor Santiago we have Vic Limlingan representing the  Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino  and House Speaker Ramon Mitra and we have Congressman Jose de Venecia representing  Lakas  EDSA and uh Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos\n\n\nMaribel excuse me for being ungallant but we will begin with the gentlemen because\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay it 's fine with me\n\n<$A> \n\nWe have a hot topic with Congressman de Venecia who will tell us about the  Batasan  the  Batasan  raid last Saturday\n\n\nJoe what happened and what 's going to happen now\n\n<$C> \n\nActually I was in Pangasinan just completed a rally at dawn and then I got a call from Congressman Amante and from Raffy Alunan to come to Manila from Pangasinan because they received a very hot tip from one of the employees of the Congress Printing Press that uh millions of sample ballots and propaganda materials of Speaker Mitra were being printed there and they wanted us to go because we are members of the House and we could make a quick inspection\n\n\nAnd I said okay I 'll come along so I came to Manila went with Congressman Amante of Agusan and Congressman Lopez of Manila to the  Batasan  to find out if it is if it 's true that uh these things are happening there\n\n\nBesides it is our moral obligation and our legal duty to do so because these are funds of the Republic of the people and when we went there we asked permission from the two guards who were there if we could enter\n\n\nThey reluctantly agreed after about fifteen minutes\n\n<$D> \n\nThey agreed so this was not a raid uh barging into a   premise that 's closed  \n\n<$C> \n\n No no   we 're gentlemen congressmen we are members of the House\n\n\nThis is our House this is our common House\n\n<$D> \n\nBut what was the reason for the ten fifteen minute delay\n\n<$C> \n\nThey were a little bit apprehensive so we were we began we became suspicious\n\n\nThen they allowed us to go in and uh Congressman Amante saw some uh sample ballots in the waste basket carrying the Mitra-Fernan ticket\n\n\nAnd uh well I thought that it could be just somebody put it there but then when we opened some of the uh tons and tons of boxes of uh propaganda materials completed there\n\n\nBut we didn't know it was propaganda materials because they were sealed with uh brown paper and then when we opened it my God we saw there uh millions of uh propaganda materials of Mitra-Fernan in English in Tagalog in Ilokano in Cebuano and uh that was the time when uh Congressman Amante called in the newspapermen who were having breakfast because there 's something to show   <unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n<$A> \n\n But the news   reports had it that you know these uh these newsmen were gathered by Raffy Alunan   <unclear> words </unclear>  restaurant in Quezon City Circle was this raid pre-meditated   as suggested by some newspapermen  \n\n<$C> \n\n It was not a raid   \n\n\n We were going   to see and check whether it 's true that there were any anything hanky panky going on there\n\n\nIf there was none then we 'll just call it a day\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd you contend that this is hanky panky\n\n<$C> \n\nI was praying that nothing would happen because we did not want to bring any impairment to the reputation of the House\n\n\nWe 've had already so many problems in the House we did not want uh this thing to happen\n\n\nAnd when uh we found that this this uh illegal massive misuse of government funds being happening there in the  Batasan  in the uh parliament of the people then Congressman Amante called in the newspapermen and when they came in they blocked the doors\n\n<$D> \n\nWho blocked the doors\n\n<$C> \n\nThe guards there blocked the doors and some of the employees blocked the doors\n\n<$D> \n\nHow many employees were in the premises\n\n<$C> \n\nThere were about seven or eight\n\n<$D> \n\nSeven I thought only two\n\n<$C> \n\nNo two were outside but inside the premises inside the printing establishment there were   <unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n<$A> \n\n Actually printing   were they running the machine\n\n<$C> \n\nRunning the machines\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd they were printing campaign materials\n\n<$C> \n\nCampaign materials   campaign materials  \n\n<$D> \n\n Or the uh   according to the employees it was the omnibus\n\n<$C> \n\nWell that that 's what I was going to say in twenty-four hours they have issued four or five versions of the story there\n\n\nWell when this was happening by the way let let me just complete the story after we made this inspection we were satisfied that a crime was being committed there we were going home make the statement and call a press conference by God the   <unclear> words </unclear>  and the marines locking the steel gates of the  Batasan  compound the complex\n\n<$A> \n\n <unclear> words   \n\n<$D> \n\nOn whose orders on whose orders\n\n<$C> \n\nWe believed it was on the instruction of the sergeant the Sergeant-at-Arms who was taking direct orders from Speaker Mitra who happened to be in Pangasinan in San Fabian Pangasinan\n\n<$D> \n\nWas the Speaker or was the Sergeant-at-Arms in the premises\n\n<$C> \n\nNo that time he was not there\n\n<$D> \n\nSo they were communicating\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd they were communicating with him and we were detained there for about three to four hours\n\n<$D> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nWe were detained when I said \" we \" Congressman Amante Congressman Lopez and myself and about twenty-two other newspapermen\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat was the reason for the detention\n\n<$C> \n\nI don't know we were uh they said that no you cannot leave you you 're not permitted to leave \n\n<$D> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd so we argue with the marine guard and then he says he 's waiting for instructions from his senior officer\n\n\nBy the way the marine guard the marines are administratively under the marine commandant but operationally under the control at the Sergeant-at-Arms who takes his orders from the Speaker of the House\n\n<$A> \n\nLet 's ask the\n\n<$C> \n\nLet let me just say that uh, we begged to to to leave the premises\n\n\nThey did not allow us and then finally I called on on Chairman Monsod and on Commissioner Yorac and said please come and see for yourself or for himself if it was going to be Chris Monsod and see this major massive uh misuse of government funds by a major presidential candidate and uh finally they came at about four o'clock\n\n\nAnd when they came at four o'clock they said the key was lost for more than an hour\n\n\nSo Yorac was stopped there for another hour and finally she was allowed to come in with the major general of the police force uh at about five o'clock and I left at about five thirty and in the meantime I was saying that they have issued five versions\n\n\nSpeaker Mitra issued a statement from Pangasian that it was a burglary\n\n\nBanayo the spokesman of the L D P said that uh that we planted the evidence\n\n\nHow could you plant the evidence by God there were tons of propaganda materials there and the marines are guarding the place and then you have the security officers of the House\n\n\nAnd secondly that means that proves that we are not in cahoots with the marines\n\n\nAs a matter of fact they detained us\n\n\nThey would not let us go\n\n\nThirdly they said  'no  that these uh sample ballots and these propaganda materials were misdelivered by a printing press in Quezon City to the printing press of of the\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's the version of Ofelia Cruz\n\n<$C> \n\nThis is the version of uh Deputy Secretary General of the House Ofelia Cruz\n\n\nThe final version is of uh Secretary General Sabio   last night  who said that these are the booklets of the Omnibus uh Local Government Code\n\n\nSo they have done four versions in less than twenty-four hours\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$D> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\nAnd there are no fifth version sixth version\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat really happened Vic Lim\n\n<$E> \n\nYeah as uh as I am not personally and emotionally involved in the issue I would like to look at larger perspective\n\n\nAnd I just have two comments to make\n\n\nThe first comment I 'd like to make is to contrast the behavior of my party the L D P when we discovered that government funds were being misused\n\n\nWe went through due process\n\n\nWe did not consider ourselves to be the investigator the prosecutor or the judge\n\n\nWhat we did is we filed a complaint with the COMELEC\n\n\nWe went to the Supreme Court in order to stop the payment of the Nalgo and Bago funds\n\n\nWe did not arrogate unto ourselves to be everything which I suppose is the habit of the military mind and the Martial Law\n\n\nWhat we would like to state therefore is in this particular case what they should have done is that if they felt that there was something wrong is to have gone and filed a case with the COMELEC to have gone to the authorities\n\n\nIt is very difficult in this situation to say that they are a disinterested bystander and therefore it is in the eyes of the law it 's quite important that they do not act as doing everything else\n\n\nThe other thing I would like to make is this seeming obsession to eliminate the candidate by technical knockout\n\n\nAgain it is uh it is a strategy which is used only in dictatorships\n\n\nWhat we would like to stress is that for these things to let the people decide\n\n\nIf you feel that Speaker Mitra has misused his funds let the people not vote for him\n\n\nThat is why we will have the election on May eleven\n\n\nWhy are we going to try to eliminate Speaker Mitra and disenfranchise what we feel would be about the eleven million voters who will vote for him\n\n\nWhy what is the point of all those\n\n<$A> \n\nBut let me just point out one thing to you uh why is it that uh I think almost all the other presidential candidates called on uh the speaker to withdraw\n\n\nI mean it is not just Ramos\n\n\nIt includes Cojuangco Salonga uh Laurel uh Miriam Defensor-Santiago\n\n<$E> \n\nWell if if uh\n\n<$A> \n\nYou think he is being singled out\n\n<$E> \n\nWell as they say he 's he 's the front-runner so if you can get the front-runner to leave   \n\n<$F> \n\nIf we go then through the course of action what is uh where do you go from here uh\n\n<$C> \n\nWell Melinda we uh we uh signed the complaint today Congressman Amante Congressman Lopez and myself\n\n\nWe filed our uh administrative complaint with the Commission on Elections pursuant to the provisions of the election code that there has been a violation of the election code punishable by six years imprisonment and permanent disqualification from office\n\n\nWhether this progresses or not it is our duty to file this uh with the Commission on Elections\n\n<$F> \n\nSo basically your your having gone to the  Batasang Pambansa  was part of a course of action completing what might be called a process \n\n\nMeaning you found evidence on which then you are now filing a case\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D> \n\nBut realistically Joe can we expect uh Speaker Mitra to be disqualified from this election\n\n<$C> \n\nUh I personally do not wish uh Speaker Mitra to be disqualified\n\n<$D> \n\nSo why file the disqualification request\n\n<$C> \n\nBut it is our duty it is our duty it is our duty under the election code to report a uh a crime committed and we filed this case with the uh COMELEC under the and then there is a criminal aspect of this case which now the the fiscals will not handle but the COMELEC will handle and the COMELEC will itself file the case with the Ombudsman\n\n\nAs to the final action of the COMELEC we leave that to uh Commissioner Yorac\n\n\nUh she said yesterday that she felt that uh there is a serious case here and that she is waiting for the proper cases to be filed with the COMELEC\n\n\nAnd this we have done\n\n<$D> \n\nApparently uh the process will take longer than five days\n\n\nAnd uh Speaker Mitra will continue to uh participate in the election", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "57e60ec3-31b0-40f6-803c-81c13580470e", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\n operating independently but in coordination with the Armed Forces of the Philippines\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm, \n\n\nAlright uh perhaps you can comment on what we have asked General Abadilla about the rumors that uh word the \" no el \"  is already a thing of the past that is already an obsolete word because the elections are proceeding comparatively uh peaceful but the \" no proclamation \" is still hanging like a sword of Damocles and uh of course we don't want that to happen we want that the voice of the people will be heard and duly registered in the uh in the uh proclamation of uh the rightful winners\n\n\nWhat can you comment on this General\n\n<$A> \n\nI share the optimism of our Chief-of-Staff and uh we are also convinced that the entire leadership of the Armed Forces of the Philippines together with the rank-and-file are convinced that there will be a proclamation come twelve noon of June thirty nineteen ninety-two, \n\n\nAnd uh we are convinced that after twelve noon of nineteen ninety-two June uh June thirty nineteen ninety-two we will have a new Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines to whom we shall uh give our loyalty and service\n\n\nAnd uh, we don't believe that uh there will be a situation where there will be no proclamation at all as uh mentioned by General Abadia this morning and uh also uh the statements of the COMELEC uh Commissioners\n\n\nThere will always be or there will be a winner to be proclaimed by June thirty nineteen ninety-two\n\n\nEven if that winner will only win by a mere uh uh plurality vote\n\n\nThere will be one who will be proclaimed as President\n\n<$B> \n\nI I I think that if the elections are clean and orderly as they are showing signs that they will definitely be we have no one to congratulate but the people ourselves  'no  \n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause I think uh the people have been very vigilant especially the volunteer groups like the P P C R V the uh Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting\n\n\nThere are about almost a million of them eight hundred thousand they think of sort and uh they are out in the in the fields and uh they are in tandem with the Civic Action Group and we have never noted this such enthusiasm as we note now amongst these volunteers  'no  \n\n\nThey 're not being paid and uh in fact uh they 're risking life and limb but uh uh they are rest assured that these elections are going to be peaceful\n\n\nThen another volunteer group is uh the   uh  Integrated Bar of the Philippines uh who will extend uh on the spot legal advice if they could uh\n\n<$A> \n\n REACT   \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd also uh you you said something about the REACT\n\n\nUh is this another communications group\n\n<$A> \n\nYes this is the Regional Emergency Action Group  'no  communication action group  'no  and this is also working in tandem with the Civic Action Group\n\n\nWe have set up a monitoring system in Camp Aguinaldo and by the way uh Ray I would like to, to just inform our public that uh in case there are rumors about uh anything that you would like to be clarified you can call up uh the rumor alert center in Camp Aguinaldo and this is uh collocated with the monitoring uh center and the telephone number is seven zero five three eight eight\n\n\nOr you can fax your message to seven zero five one eight one\n\n\nThere is always an officer responsible to clarify any rumor that you would like to be clarified\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay you got those numbers\n\n\nAgain they are seven zero five three eight eight\n\n\nAnd if uh you have a fax machine seven zero five one eight one\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd they can call up the trunk line of uh Camp Aguinaldo which is seven two one nine zero zero one and seven two one nine zero three one and ask for local six seven six three six seven five two and six seven four three and there are always people who will attend to your query or uh information\n\n<$B> \n\nGeneral Gaby uh COMELEC is ready now and so we have Cielo Villaluna there I think uh she has the very popular and the very colorful Commissioner Haydee Yorac\n\n\nCielo  \n\n<$C> \n\nThank you very much Ray and Gaby we are now back at the Commission on Elections and we 're coming in live\n\n\nWith me is the very popular Commissioner Haydee Yorac who is who will be off to the Mindanao province at twelve noon today and uh she said that she 's quite in a rush so we will go through this interview as fast as we can\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay Cielo I would like to take the first crack at the question\n\n\nFirst I like to bid her Godspeed in her trip to Mindanao and then uh very quickly now uh Ms Commissioner uh how do you make an assessment of the ongoing elections up to this time from seven A M up to this time\n\n<$D> \n\nI uh voted at eight thirty this morning and I went to the Pi&ntilde;ahan Elementary School and then I went to the Quezon City Hall and the Office of the Election Registrar and uh just uh uh went uh by different precincts in Metro Manila and uh my general impression up to this point is that the elections are proceeding smoothly\n\n\nNaturally if you are managing an elections as massive as we are conducting now there will be a few hitches,  \n\n<$B> \n\nI think that 's one of the few hitches that uh Commissioner Yorac is uh talking about uh\n\n\nWell it 's a technical problem beyond our control in the meantime back to the panel here\n\n\nUh Gaby and I have uh several phoned-in complaints from our televiewers and uh just as soon as Ms Yorac is installed back and uh she 's able to uh go on the air we will be able to refer these questions uh to her\n\n\nIn the meantime back to what we we 're talking about about volunteer groups and these accredited groups\n\n\nLet 's not fail to mention the Media Assistance Quick Count, uh you 're aware of this of course and uh you know how massive uh this uh  agrupment  is\n\n\nAren't you General\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes uh we have also some linkages with them\n\n\nAs a matter of fact we have uh several meetings with Ms Tita De Villa and some representatives of the Media Citizens Quick Count\n\n\nAnd uh we have linkages with them and uh we are working very closely with them\n\n<$B> \n\nLet me ask Gaby Roldan here if uh she has in one way or another any involvement in these volunteer groups because I have uh I 'm uh one of the P P C R V active member in in my parish\n\n\nUh do you ever or did you ever join any of these volunteer groups\n\n<$E> \n\nNo not recently\n\n\nUhm I was supposed to join the the group for the Parish Pastoral for Responsible Voting except that uhm we 've been quite busy preparing for the elections so I think this is my uh small contribution towards ensuring a you know orderly elections by way of information to our viewers  via channel nine 's coverage of the elections\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay uh I 'm very excited about uh seeing Commissioner Yorac all over again\n\n\nI think she is uh on now and then our technical facilities are A-OK\n\n\nSo come in COMELEC\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay we\n\n\nAre we on\n\n\nOkay we are now back at the COMELEC\n\n\nWe just had some difficult problems a while ago\n\n\nAs Commissioner Yorac was saying there have been reports of uh unconfirmed reports of massive disenfranchisement and Commissioner Yorac is warning media to first confirm reports prior to reporting\n\n\nShe has made the rounds of the different polling precincts in the Quezon City area and to give a recap Commissioner Yorac will you give us once more your update\n\n<$D> \n\nYes uh in uh   Barangay  Pi&ntilde;ahan where I vote at the Pi&ntilde;ahan Elementary School voting was proceeding quickly and smoothly and uh there was only one precinct where there was a minor hitch\n\n\nThe ballots did not arrive but the Chairman of the Board of Election Inspectors has gotten the Registrar 's Office and the Office of the Treasurer that by this time I am sure that the problem has already been addressed\n\n\nUh there were also reports about uh the uh delays in the delivery of uh paraphernalia in district two and uh this is explained by the fact that we were solving the problem of misallocation last night\n\n\nUh certain uh uh bags had to be uh repacked redistributed\n\n\nAnd uh but uh on the whole the elections are going very very smoothly\n\n\nAnd whatever reported incidents are really very small incidents compared to the general orderliness peacefulness and uh enthusiasm about the elections\n\n<$C> \n\nAlso joining us this morning is the Honorable Chairman Christian Monsod who will give us an update later on but first we shall continue with our interview with Commissioner Yorac because she will be soon flying off to the Mindanao province\n\n\nMa'am you will be your first stop will be Jolo and it will be followed by Zamboanga and Tawi-tawi\n\n\nDo you have an initial assessment of the conduct of the voting in these areas\n\n<$D> \n\nUh well uh my my reports so far is everything is uh going smoothly\n\n\nThe critical leaders of these provinces which we have placed under COMELEC control have accepted uh special procedures that we have set up in these places\n\n\nAmong which are the uh designation of the Armed Forces of the Philippines as the lead agency in helping the elections implement uh election laws and rules\n\n\nUh the P N P 's only secondary in these areas \n\n\nSecond is the clustering that we have done\n\n\nAnd third the uh safekeeping of uh of uh critical election uh supplies such as the uh indelible ink the uh election returns and the certificates of canvass <unclear> word </unclear> the military commanders for delivering only at the time of counting at the start of canvass\n\n<$C> \n\nThe election hot spots in Mindanao are the so-called critical areas and the COMELEC has been very vigilant in ensuring orderly honest and peaceful polls\n\n\nAnd over the past weeks we have met with the political leaders who in turn have given the assurance that they will abide by the by the election laws\n\n\nCan you give us an update on the participation and the behavior of the political groups\n\n\nIs peace and order running in the area\n\n<$D> \n\nWell uh yes while we 've had a few incidents in the last few days for example there was this bombing in Cotabato City uh which uh resulted in the death of a number of persons\n\n\nThere was also a bomb explosion in Isabela which is the capital of Basilan province and this is the reason among others which uh made the COMELEC cluster the voting in the uh province of Basilan\n\n\nUh the uh marine commandant there uh sent us a uh a uh rush telegram saying that he could not assure the peace and order situation in the course of the voting unless the elections uh were clustered\n\n\nAnd so we uh clustered the voting\n\n\nI understand that there have been some reactions on the part of the of some political leaders\n\n\nUh I got a telephone call from Governor Salapudin last night uh asking me to postpone the elections but I said that it is the sense of the uh Commission  en banc  that we should continue with the national elections and we will take it from there\n\n<$C> \n\nThere is an unconfirmed report that uh voting did not push through in Marawi City\n\n\nWould you clarify this point\n\n<$D> \n\nI think the point has already been clarified\n\n\nWe have been in touch with the Regional Election Director for Region twelve Atty Teresita Llaban\n\n\nAnd the confirmed fact is that there is voting in Marawi\n\n\nThere was a slight problem in the Municipality of  Masue  \n\n\nBut there is voting in Marawi\n\n\nAnd I 'm really amazed with that kind of report because I was speaking with Atty Omar Umpar who is running for vice-governor in the province of Marawi\n\n\nAt one o'clock this morning there was no indication at all from him who should be most interested about the process in Marawi City because he votes in Marawi City but uh he did not give me any indication that anything was remiss about the delivery of supplies and materials in Marawi City\n\n\nAnd we just have it now the final word of the matter \n\n\nMarawi is voting and voting is going on peacefully and in an orderly fashion\n\n<$B> \n\nAlright Commissioner Yorac may I butt in please\n\n<$C> \n\nGo ahead Ray\n\n<$B> \n\nHow much time do you still have\n\n\nHow much time do you still have for us \n\n<$D>

of social stratification is income\n\n\nBecause of the difficulty in obtaining these data other factors such as size of house kind and number of appliances the household has were considered\n\n\nNow in terms of income  ano ba 'yung  A B\n\n\nWell the A B are those with over one hundred thousand per year the salary C those uh who have sixty thousand to one hundred thousand pesos uh as income per year and D below sixty thousand pesos\n\n\nOther factors mentioned were used  subjectively intensifying the borderline classes\n\n\nBased on the nineteen eighty-eight family income and expenditures survey the criteria mentioned earlier classifies sixty-four point seventy-one percent of households as class D E twenty point forty-four percent as class C and fourteen point eighty-five percent as class A B\n\n\nIn Metro Manila alone fifty-one point twenty-four percent were classified as class D E twenty-seven point thirty-four percent as class C and twenty-one point thirty-two percent as class A B\n\n\nThe  barangays  were stratified according to the dominant class of the residents\n\n\nA class A B  barangay  is dominated by A B residents\n\n\nA class D E  barangay  is dominated by D E residents\n\n\nA class C  barangay  on the other hand is not necessarily dominated by class C residents rather we see a mixture of A B C and D E residents\n\n\nThe survey includes fifteen  barangays  allocated equally to the three socio-economic groups\n\n\nOnly one voting center will be enumerated in each sample  barangay  \n\n\nFrom the chosen voting center thirty percent of the precincts will be taken as a representative\n\n\nThe chosen  barangays  for the respective classes are as follows\n\n\nClass A B one  barangay  each from Makati Las Pi&ntilde;as Quezon City San Juan Marikina as you can see\n\n\nFor class C one  barangay  each from Marikina Pasig Manila Muntinlupa Quezon City\n\n\nFor class D E one  barangay  each from Para&ntilde;aque Quezon City Muntinlupa Manila and Marikina\n\n\nWe have fielded twenty-one volunteers to cover the designated areas\n\n\nWe 're expecting that approximately thirty percent of the votes will be canvassed by nine o'clock this evening\n\n\nOur volunteers will take uh note of the partial and unofficial returns and by nine o'clock or ten o'clock this evening we will have that report for you\n\n\nUh we would like to emphasize that we are not trending\n\n\nWe are not projecting\n\n\nWe 're just sampling on how the different uh socio-economic classes in these defined areas have voted are voting and later on as the M C Q C count comes in because the M C Q C count will come in tomorrow yet at around four o'clock or two o'clock in the afternoon\n\n\nSo in between what you will have would be the reportage from our R P N network 's uh volunteers our own reporters C N N Allied and so on and so forth\n\n\nBut we will be giving you this network demographic count which is highlight of \" Pollwatch ninety-two \" \n\n\nWe have the man on top of this uh project Dr Arniel Barrios\n\n\nUh  siguro  that was a mouthful I said  'no  \n\n\nIt is your project so uh are the volunteers out already in their respective areas\n\n<$B> \n\nUh they 're still here and uh after this I 'm supposed to brief them and uh their they 'll go to their respective assignments\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd by three o'clock this afternoon uh we 're going to decide uh how many how many precincts they are going to consider for each uh voting center\n\n\nAnd then we have to they will uh relax there wait after the uh\n\n<$A> \n\nClosing\n\n<$B> \n\nA certain\n\n\nYeah closing \n\n\nAnd after a certain number of uh votes have been counted uh they will uh have the partial tabulation\n\n<$A> \n\nAre we having the Civic Action Group to   uh  utilize\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nThey have uhm uh installed their station there\n\n<$A> \n\nAlright\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh they 're supposed to be the one who will transmit the uh partial returns \n\n\nAnd uh tomorrow for the uh final tabulation we will also assist our volunteers to uh bring the uh questionnaires here in the studio\n\n<$A> \n\nSo uh we can be assured a very fast transmission of   results  \n\n<$B> \n\n Right   \n\n<$A> \n\nBecause we have the C A G the Civic Action Group backing it up\n\n\nThey are mobile and they are equipped with the V H F facilities\n\n\nGaby are we talking Greek or\n\n<$C> \n\nWell no it is just that it is very interesting uh how the whole concept about this demographic count is very interesting to me\n\n\nAnd I 'm at at this point I 'm wondering how the demographic count results will fare as far as the official results are going to come out\n\n<$A> \n\nWell official you 'll refer to the COMELEC\n\n<$C> \n\nTo the COMELEC\n\n<$A> \n\nThe COMELEC tabulation   is  the official not even M C Q C\n\n<$C> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nBut that the point you 're asking is whether our sampling will match eventually with the unofficial or even the official\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh as what Mr Pedroche has mentioned a while ago we are going to take samples in Metro Manila only\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIt means that uh whatever result we are going to obtain this may apply only in Metro Manila okay\n\n<$C> \n\nAt this point uh excuse me\n\n\nAt this point do you have any uhm propositions\n\n\nDo you have any premises as of now as to for example how the A and B the C the D and the E are going to vote\n\n<$B> \n\nNot yet\n\n<$A> \n\nThat is what we 're going to look for\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nUh and then let 's say in Forbes Park for example uh that 's an A mostly A and upper B area\n\n\nUh we will know by around ten o'clock uh how an A area for example Forbes Park uh voted  'no  voted President Vice-President and the senatorial candidates  'no  \n\n\nAnd then compare it with the other uh A B groups uh in in Metro Manila\n\n\nAnd later on as we get results from the provinces the different city centers urban centers there and match  'no  whether there is really uh\n\n<$B> \n\nLater on we will find out if uh our survey have obtained a representative of how the uh voting population voted\n\n\nBut the main objective of this of the uh survey is mainly to know how the different socio-economic classes voted here in Metro Manila\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay I hope it 's clear\n\n\nIt 's not to pre-empt M C Q C\n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's not to establish a trend\n\n\nIt is not uh as if it is an official count\n\n\nIt is an unofficial count \n\n\nAnd it has to be emphasized that uh this is just a sampling taken from the entire universe of uh the electorate okay\n\n\nSo watch that and that 's going to be one of the highlights of \" Pollwatch ninety-two \" \n\n\nWhat do we have next\n\n\nOkay Arniel is there anything more you would like to say before uh we let you go\n\n\nI know you have to go to your uh post to talk to your volunteers\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nHave some briefing\n\n<$A> \n\nNo problems with the I D  ha  \n\n\nNo more problems\n\n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay again I would like to uh clarify to the televiewers that this is just a survey and we have taken uh five precincts from what we think are the class A B five precincts no sorry five voting centers five voting centers from what we think are class C and five uh voting centers from what we think are class D E in Metro Manila only okay\n\n\nAnd uh as we know Metro Manila is an urbanized area uh but this does not necessarily mean that all other urban uh centers voted same as what has happened here in Metro  as what was going to happen here in Metro Manila\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay uh Gaby isn't that interesting  'no  \n\n\nWon't you want to know how the people in Tondo let 's say an E area\n\n<$C> \n\nThat 's why I asked Dr Barrios earlier if they have certain propositions that they merely want to validate because I suppose uh we all know that there are some candidates like in the presidentiables and vice-presidentiables who would definitely be you know a mass mass who would have mass appeal and are they\n\n\nI was wondering earlier whether the demographic count would seek to validate certain   propositions  \n\n<$A> \n\n Well maybe   that that is not although that is not the main objective it might in a way incidentally validate that without meaning to but uh if it does validate then that 's alright isn't it\n\n<$B> \n\nActually based on this uh late recent uh uh days there are some uh articles in \" Inquirer \" \n\n\nThey 're trying to uh  uh construct some theories on how uh the voting population are going to vote\n\n<$A> \n\nIs that so\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I I think uh there 's an article there on uh uh according to them they 're going to vote according to the socio-economic classes and but they have not mentioned uh who are the preferences of each classes\n\n<$A> \n\nUh other uh classifications aside from uh socio-economic could be the different sectors  'no  \n\n\nFor example answer this for me Dr Barrios is there uh a religious vote with I 'm talking about  Iglesia  vote Catholic vote\n\n\nIs there a youth vote\n\n\nIs there a  vote\n\n\nIs there an A B vote and so on and so forth huh\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't really   know  \n\n<$A> \n\n Okay   let 's confine to the youth vote and the  vote  'no  \n\n<$B> \n\nI think\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause it 's  dangerous to tread on the religious vote\n\n<$B> \n\nUh in my personal opinion I think there is such a thing as the  Iglesia  vote\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nBut when it comes to youth I don't I 'm I 'm not really sure if there is such a thing as youth vote\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah \" youth \" means that uh they are thirty-five uh years of age and below and they comprise one half of the thirty-two point   something  million uh voters\n\n<$B> \n\n Right   \n\n\nWell if there is such a thing as a youth vote whoever that uh candidate is uh he or she will be assured of about fifty-six percent of the voting population\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh will the youth if there 's a youth vote vote solidly for\n\n<$B> \n\nIf there 's such a thing\n\n<$A> \n\nIf there 's such a thing\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nThere 's another uh group which uh I 'm looking for an answer to as to whether there is a  vote because there are millions of them\n\n\nThere are about uhm seventy members of a household belonging to a  or an agricultural of sort group\n\n\nImagine that seventy did I say about that  'no  \n\n<$C> \n\nWell I think there are efforts right now among the  groups to consolidate themselves and come up with a some form of a  vote although I think they themselves agree that uh as of now there is no definite  vote\n\n\nBut I think it is the process of constructing or making one I think which is what they find in this year 's election\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay I I you 're right there\n\n\nUh we 'll go back to this discussion\n\n\nUh we have uh in readiness now a report from uh Cagayan de Oro D X K O\n\n\nCome in Cagayan de Oro  \n\n\nThank you very much Atty Art Cuaresma D X K O Cagayan de Oro\n\n\nNow back to the different sectors and their votes\n\n\nWe asked earlier if there 's a  vote the youth vote and uh Dr Barrios was saying it seems that there 's a youth vote but he was not very definite about it\n\n\nBut uh would you want to repeat what you said if there 's a youth vote \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah uh if there 's such a thing as youth vote uh that whoever that candidate is favored by uh this sector uh he or she will be assured about fifty-six percent of the uh votes\n\n<$A> \n\nBut then I I dare say that uh not all of that will go to one particular candidate because the youth vote I think is also further divided into\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nMore   than one  candidate\n\n<$B> \n\n Exactly", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8810680d-908a-486d-8f05-5cc4bdfb9116", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.100814+00:00"}

like to give the benefit of the doubt to Ms  Martinez  \n\n\nIt 's possible that somebody told her that Atty  Romualdez  did indeed receive money\n\n\nThat to me is uh and especially so that it 's coming out that the person who told Ms  Martinez  that uh somebody uh that  Dan Romualdez  did indeed receive money came from somebody from a polluted source\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay okay yeah Senator

it\n\n<$C> \n\nI did not need any encouragement from him\n\n<$A> \n\n<O> laughter <O> Well but but   honestly  \n\n<$B> \n\n Okay   \n\n<$A> \n\nWe didn't do anything to to really uh uh stop the issue from being ventilated in   public  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$A> \n\nBecause we 're sure that as as the more it gets to the public the more clear it becomes the issue becomes and the issue\n\n\nUh uh what are the facts that there are no there is no evidence to uh to show that the First Gentleman received money and that there is no evidence that uh he even tried to influence his wife\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nSo those are the facts so why will you not encourage the discussion of those facts in public\n\n<$B> \n\nUh usually  kasi pag  publicist P R they would rather uh not talk about it you

\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nSir uhm Senator Ople was saying a few days ago guns of August  'no  \n\n\nUh this was supposed to be part of it  paano na ho kung wala na hong bala  guns of August  pa ba  or is it guns of September October\n\n<$C> \n\nWell let me just repeat uh what I have said that uh we are trying to be a responsible opposition\n\n\nUh that means we don't fire guns you know figuratively   speaking  uh in the Senate without any basis\n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n<$C> \n\nAnd that 's the reason why uh I have tried to touch base with Ms Martinez through an emissary who

and I so I said look uh uh it 's very difficult for me to start even filing a resolution when I don't have any solid uh thing to stand on you know \n\n I cannot rely on what I hear on TV or see on

to the effect that uh she heard that  Dan Romualdez  received money\n\n\nSo uh she admitted that that what she said earlier during the week uh was based on hearsay\n\n\nSo let 's let 's leave it at that let 's give her the benefit of the doubt\n\n<$B> \n\nUh is the president aware already of uh her latest Ms  Martinez  's latest statement\n\n<$A> \n\nOh I 'm sure she is\n\n\nI 'm sure she

and for all she clarified her statement uh if not retracted her statement but  nabunutan ng parang tinik  no it 's part of part of politics\n\n\nWe look at it as part of the part of the propaganda maybe of some I said some members of the opposition\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm you 're not referring to Senator Pimentel who 's sitting beside you\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no no no Senator Pimentel is a very sober gentleman\n\n\nAnd uh I know we 've we 've gone a long way no no no\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen we come back we 'll continue our discussion with Senate minority leader Nene Pimentel and President  Romualdez  's personal publicist Mr Dante Ang\n\n\nWe 'll be joined by Congressman Prospero Pichay and People 's Consultative Assembly Secretary General Linda Olaguer Montayre\n\n\nStay with us\n\n\nThis is \" Strictly Politics \"  \n\n\nJoining us now in this uh uh second half of the show are Linda Olaguer Montayre of the People 's Consultative Assembly and Congressman Prospero Pichay\n\n\nCongressman Pichay uh a little background  kayo po yung nag-file ng  impeachment complaint  di ba kay  G M R  dati  \n\n<$D> \n\nIn the eleventh congress yes\n\n<$B> \n\nUh and now you 're here to uh help defend the First Gentleman\n\n<$D> \n\nNot really defend we we we legislators we always want to find out the truth and uh that 's why uh we are here because we want to ferret out the truth\n\n<$B> \n\nUh you you heard the statements of  Chit Martinez  a while ago\n\n\nWhat is your reaction to that\n\n<$D> \n\nWell uh at least uh she came out in the open and told the truth\n\n\nYou can't hide the truth for a long time and uh I think the basis of her statement was a hearsay coming from  Rita Canlas  and uh uh you you were asking earlier you said what happens now \n\n\nThere 's still that statement of  Rita Canlas  \n\n\nBut uh I feel and I believe that uh the group uh of uh the the this corporation that wanted to get the franchise will come out with the statement that there was no pay off\n\n\nThere was no money involved and she is part of that group\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm okay\n\n<$D> \n\nSo uh among the many in the group uh I think uh the official statement should come out as the truth\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh Mrs Montayre the People 's Consultative Assembly came out with the statement today in the newspapers uh in \" Today \" I think and  ano pang dyaryo ho ang lumabas saan lumabas  \n\n<$E> \n\nUh  sa \" Pinoy Times \"  and then in \"  Malaya  \" \n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh and you also\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd \"  Abante  \" \n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh\n\n\nDoesn't this the latest statement of Ms  Martinez  take the wind out of your statement Ma'am\n\n<$E> \n\nUh not really because that 's just one part of our statement\n\n\nUh in the first place regarding  Chit  Pimentel 's statement\n\n<$B> \n\n   Chit Martinez   \n\n<$E> \n\n Uh  Chit Martinez    \n\n\nI 'm sorry  Chit Martinez  's statement\n\n\nWhile we respect her  'no  we 're not that convinced so easily  'no    because  there 's something not convincing about her statement\n\n<$B> \n\n Why why   \n\n\nWhat is in this that is not true to you\n\n<$E> \n\nBecause of course there are legalities that we have to talk about and that 's what Senator Pimentel has said they respect it but as far as we are concerned  mukhang hindi tama e ni-raise nya yung isyu tapos biglang ga ganoonin lang na parang wala  \n\n\n  Where there is smoke there is fire   \n\n\n Sa N G Os kasi sa mga masa sa tao yung ganon hindi kasimple simple lang ng ganon  \n\n\nHow come it was raised in the first place and then the president was explaining all about the role of  Chit Martinez  then  Ramon Espiritu  \n\n\nI think there should be more uh investigation uh regarding that particular uh  uh the particular story of the president\n\n\nSo whether the Senate takes it up or does not take it up anymore that would be sad if they don't but for us that 's not enough we are not contented\n\n\nThat 's and then as I was saying that 's only the first portion of our statement\n\n\nWe have the statement regarding the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so first  oo  Ma'am  bale ang ang unang uh bahagi po ng  statement  nyo  you 're you 're extremely disturbed by the accusations of uh  Chit Martinez  against the First Gentleman and then you go on to the P C S O also\n\n<$E> \n\nYeah of course\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh yeah what has that got to do with  Dan Romualdez  \n\n\nWhy why is  Dan Romualdez  's name here", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b4162888-db05-4b45-bef9-e41d263bcec1", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood evening\n\n\nWelcome to \" Points of View \" \n\n\nI 'm Teddy Locsin Junior\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I 'm Cher Calvin\n\n<$C> \n\nI 'm Jessica Zafra\n\n\nTonight 's episode was inspired by e-mail from one of our viewers Sari Monteclaro who suggested that we tackle  uh consumer rights\n\n\nAt some point we all have experienced bad service or bought shabbily made products\n\n\nBut how many times have we ever asserted our consumer rights\n\n\nI know I do\n\n\nAnd for this I 'm you know referred to as some kind of Bella Flores complaining all the time\n\n\nAnd if the stories are true then I have ingested spit from every single waiter in Metro Manila whose service I 've complained about\n\n\nNow do we have consumer rights in the Philippines\n\n\nHow many of us are aware of this\n\n\nAnd do we actually assert these rights\n\n\nAnd also given that  most of the employees in stores and in restaurants aren't real employees but casual employees who expect to lose their jobs within the space of a few months have we got a right to expect good service\n\n<$A> \n\nWell uhm I don't know if we have really a law uhm defining consumer rights but I do know that just on the Law of Contracts if you don't get what you pay for you should theoretically be able to\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nGet back your money\n\n<$B&$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nOr or or change it for something better something that suits more the object that you wanted to have\n\n<$B&$C> \n\nUh-hmmmh\n\n<$A> \n\nBut uhm I don't know my own experience is I never complain\n\n\nThe people like me for that and I guess that 's the price I pay living with the satisfaction and keeping it bottled up   inside  \n\n<$C> \n\n Maybe   complaining is more of a girl thing   'cause I  \n\n<$B> \n\n I definitely complain   a lot   you know  \n\n<$C> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nBut I I try  I try not to complain too much at the restaurants you know whatever but because of ingesting other people 's spit and so forth you know  \n\n\nI 'll wait until you know but then then we also have a guest who was saying earlier when we were uh getting ready for the show that he was he 's found guest uh guests in his restaurant the customers in his restaurant that will complain after you know their eating so I guess I shouldn't do that either   right  \n\n<$C> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nUhm but I I don't know\n\n\nI think that I I think that as a customer we do especially in restaurants have  definitely deserve the best kind of service that you can get\n\n\nI mean if like my plate is done it should be removed right away\n\n\nYou know those kind of things whether you are in a five star restaurant or in a two star restaurant\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThose are like just things I I expect to happen right\n\n\nAnd they don't and it 's kind of frustrating when you 're raising your hand up and no one is even paying attention to you at all and they 're all in the back making  kuwento  \n\n<$C> \n\nI know\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know that 's a little frustrating as well but then another thing that kind of also irks me is that there are a lot of uhm I 've got a lot to complain about  \n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's really a girl thing  \n\n<$B> \n\nIt really is a girl thing\n\n\nIs that when you buy products and then they 're refurbished\n\n\nYou know what I mean you 'll go to like uhm whatever whatever place and buy like a cellphone or whatever and then you get something that you paid for uhm like it 's supposed to be made in Finland right\n\n\nAnd then when you get home and and you really check it out or a couple of weeks later you you 're how come it 's broken already \n\n\n  And  then you don't you can't do anything about it at all\n\n<$C> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nThere goes ten thousand  you know ten thousand pesos on a telephone for example   right  \n\n<$C> \n\n Uh uhm   and October is Consumer Rights Month\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nWhich which brings us to uhm something I learned recently that there is no such thing as no return no exchange \n\n<$B> \n\nRight\n\n<$C> \n\nEven in the Philippines and yet have you actually tried to exchange a product\n\n\nThe few times that I 've tried to exchange clothes that I 've bought everybody just just looks at me as if I 'm some kind of freak which I am but they have no right to look at me as if I were a freak  \n\n\nAnd then they 'll they 'll try to find something wrong with the product that they can blame on you so that they don't have to  to exchange it with   anything  \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$A> \n\nBut I think you know the the worry is there is that if they give in to you word will get around and people will abuse but you know\n\n\nUhm uhm I mean I hate to make comparisons again but I think Americans are known to abuse\n\n\nBut they 've lived with that the system has accommodated it and the result is better service\n\n\nThey just gotta charge it to experience or raise their costs but uhm taking it back and substituting it for something better uhm has  made shopping a joy there\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n\nOh that 's what I mean even when you buy gifts you know they 've got in in the States or whatever I was I just received the gift that I got like a receipt a  a gift receipt if in case I didn't like the present   I could go and it doesn't matter what the price  or anything because I won't know\n\n<$C> \n\n You can exchange it for something you like   \n\n<$A> \n\nBut but there is one one area where we have this exchange policy that 's wedding gifts\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAlmost everywhere the gift is assumed it 'll go back to   uh  the department store and exchanged for something else\n\n<$C> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nWill they give you cash\n\n<$A> \n\nI think they do\n\n\n  I think they give you gift certificates  \n\n<$B> \n\n I think   \n\n<$C> \n\nWell more of our complaints questions and suggestions about  consumer rights when we come back  \n\n<$A> \n\nNow you can move goods faster electronically\n\n\nYou can buy stuff on the computer I guess  'no  \n\n\nAnd uhm you think that the digital revolution the computer revolution has well made buying and selling so much better so much more convenient but has it really made the customer king\n\n\nThat 's the adage of department stores restaurants throughout the ages\n\n\nIs the customer king now\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay well let 's find out from our guests what they think if the customer is king or not\n\n\nAnd joining us is Andrew Masigan and he 's the owner of  Struan and Tang 's  and he thinks that Filipinos are very vocal in their complaints and difficult to please\n\n\nAlso joining us is Deedee Sytangco\n\n\nShe 's a spokesperson of former President  Corazon Aquino and writes for the \" Manila Bulletin \" \n\n\nAnd as a consumer she believes that uh the consumer is king and thus always right until proven wrong\n\n\nUhm also joining us is Maurice Orosa and he used you used to own a restaurant right\n\n\nAnd he thinks that the consumer is oftentimes right but not always\n\n\nUh and then Allan Coronel director Studio twenty-three Creative Sales doesn't think that customers are always right\n\n\nYou guys kind of agree huh\n\n\nUhm but he doesn't want to be shortchanged for what he paid for\n\n\nOkay welcome to the show\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay I I heard that one of you had  one of your wives uh wife of one of you  had this experience with a caterpillar on the salad which goes to show just how fresh it was  \n\n<$C> \n\nYikes\n\n<$D> \n\nThat was my wife\n\n\nWe were eating and she ordered uh Caesar 's salad\n\n\nCaesar 's salad came in and my son goes Mom there 's something crawling \n\n<$B> \n\nUh\n\n<$D> \n\nIt was green\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's Caesar\n\n<$D> \n\nIt was a caterpillar\n\n\nI guess it wasn't part of the sauce\n\n<$B> \n\nDid you complain right away\n\n<$D> \n\nWe did\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then\n\n<$D> \n\nThey changed it\n\n<$B> \n\n But but you found out that in some of your customers have inserted things into their   food  right\n\n<$E> \n\n Well yeah   \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nLike glass\n\n<$A> \n\n  Do they really do it  \n\n<$E> \n\n Well it does happen   \n\n\nIt does happen and uhm the thing is uh there is some malicious intent to extort money\n\n<$C> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$E> \n\nUh if they do it intentionally\n\n\nBut uh going back to your case  if if it does happen uh like let 's say in  Struan and Tang 's  Tea Salon if uh not to say that it did happen but if it does happen uh the the first thing that the first thing to do is immediately to replace the product\n\n\nAnd in our case we give the we give the item uh complimentary\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know what though\n\n\nI 'd be kind of grossed out   like  already having eaten that uh Caesar 's salad   and  there was a   caterpillar  in it\n\n<$E> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n True   \n\n\n Yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\nI mean   what 's  to say there isn't more caterpillars in   that  \n\n<$E> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$F> \n\n No   but you see\n\n<$E> \n\nTrue\n\n<$B> \n\nCaesar 's salad\n\n<$F> \n\nBut you see Cher for a for a you know for for the client\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$F> \n\nFor the customer you know I may be I may be proven you know right that oh there 's something in my salad and all that but as long as the owner of the restaurant is pleasant and agreeable you know\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> 2 words </unclear> \n\n<$F> \n\n<unclear> 3 words </unclear> like you   know  \n\n<$A> \n\n And   says don't worry  we only have just one caterpillar you won't get more caterpillars  \n\n<$F> \n\nI mean if he 's not if he doesn't become disagreeable and say you 've eaten half your salad and how do I know if you 've brought in the caterpillar  etcetera etcetera  \n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> 3 words </unclear>  \n\n<$F> \n\nYou know I would not really you know as a customer I will not\n\n\nBut there are other instances when you 're returning a product to the department store and it 's clearly you know a lemon\n\n<$E> \n\nDefective\n\n<$F> \n\nYeah defective and then they 'll say no  etcetera etcetera  \n\n\nNow that I which is what to my point I say that if you are a if you want to be a good uh if you want to have uh value for your money you must first know what are your rights\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm   okay  \n\n<$F> \n\n Because   that 's consumer we 're all consumers\n\n\nWe must know what what is our responsibility and what is our right you know\n\n<$B> \n\nDoes that mean that that the \" No Exchange the No Exchange No Return \" is that is that really are they allowed to do that\n\n<$F> \n\nI don't think so\n\n\nI think the we have a Consumer Act but I don't think like I know some a very well known wine store that has a big big uh   sign  you know \" Wines Purchased in This Deli You Cannot Return \" \n\n<$B> \n\n Sign   \n\n\nBut you know   what that 's wrong that 's wrong  because I mean you can get a whole case of wine\n\n<$F> \n\n That 's not right that 's not right   \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's you know   bad and sour  \n\n<$A> \n\n Because you have to return at least   I mean the bottle\n\n<$F> \n\nYeah the bottle yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then give your opinion\n\n<$F> \n\nAnd then   don't come  \n\n<$A> \n\n Then just think of   \n\n<$F> \n\nTeddy Boy don't come back in six months at least I mean\n\n<$A> \n\nUh of course I mean\n\n<$B> \n\nAt least six months  \n\n<$F> \n\nYou know don't I mean it 's really you drink it you know at night\n\n\nYou open the red wine and it 's really  patis  \n\n\nThen return it the next day  \n\n<$E> \n\nBut I agree I agree with the\n\n<$A> \n\nBut I think you 'll find that people will complain will not complain about small things that don't cost much\n\n\nLike like me I never complain but when it 's something really bigger\n\n<$F> \n\nOh yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nLike an air conditioner\n\n<$F> \n\nOh well\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's really when I 'm gonna say I 'm gonna burn down your store  \n\n\n  Sure  I mean\n\n<$E> \n\n Teddy   \n\n\nYou get\n\n\nMy point is you you get what you pay for\n\n\nLet 's say   you go to  a two star restaurant or you go to a place just   right beside of ,   at the side of  the road\n\n<$A> \n\n You do   \n\n<$F> \n\n You get what you   \n\n\n You get two star food   \n\n<$B> \n\nOh well of course   of course  yeah\n\n<$E> \n\n You know   \n\n\nSo you can't demand the best service or the best products in in such a place\n\n<$F> \n\nNo but Andrew\n\n<$E> \n\nIt 's relative to\n\n<$F> \n\nIf if you went to uh a fast food chain of course you won't expect five you know   five  star service and all that\n\n<$E> \n\n Correct   \n\n\nYeah but you expect that the food is edible", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nTherefore the new leadership that would uh uh be formally installed come uh July one\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nUh we do realize that uh the President-elect uh will have to unite a divided nation nation divided because of the political exercise that we 've just had\n\n\nUh then they would have the new leader would have to invoke a new moratorium on dissension particularly if we expect a Congress that may not be uh that may not come from the party of whoever the President will be\n\n\nSo the, the new President-elect would be hard-pressed trying to forge unity but we believe that during the first hundred days all sectors would unite and and extend uh its cooperation to the President-elect and uh while we do realize that this will not be an easy task it will be a difficult uh task admittedly the private sector uh will be there uh particularly the P C C I providing its uh support and cooperation\n\n\nAnd in this regard we have uh taken the

are to present to uh the President-elect\n\n\nHere we detail uh specific areas of concern the fact to be addressed during the first one hundred days uh among which if I could just uh share the the broad uh framework of of our proposal\n\n\nOne you have the need to address the power issue\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThe energy crisis that continues to confront us\n\n\nUh second uh the need to mobilize investments for domestic and foreign\n\n\nThird the need to promote exports uh giving it the highest priority\n\n\nUh fourth uh fiscal and uh monetary reforms that have already been negotiated by the Aquino government and which should be sustained\n\n\nUh and and fifth and very important is the need to maintain peace and order\n\n\nSo these five areas we have uh identified as uh deserving which has been the subject of a consensus incidentally by the business community and here we detail very specific strategies and uh doable uh measures that that can be put to place so that uh the economy could be uh brought to a <unclear> 2 words </unclear> \n\n\nAnd here we see uh I guess I think a three or two percent growth in G N P\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay now may we have some parting words from the secretary uh\n\n\nOf course I know that you are at the helm of the P N P operations\n\n\nAnything that you need to say to our televiewers uh Mr Secretary\n\n<$C> \n\nOh I think the first thing I would like to uh uh say is, to the local officials who have just been through the exercise of campaigning\n\n\nUh I think that it 's high time that they take a rest, and let the process of counting go on as uh this <unclear> 1 word </unclear> \n\n\nThe campaign uh period although the people have uh chosen who they thought of they think ought to be the leaders\n\n\n Sana huwag nilang pakialaman ang bilangan  \n\n\nAnd uh just wait for the results of uh what the people feel ought to be the mandate\n\n\n Ikalawa siguro gusto ko ring i  uh uh to remind our P N P officers and men nationwide  na tayo ay uh binigyan ng responsibilidad ng COMELEC na ating bantayan ang  uh counting uh transportation of documents from precinct to municipality from municipality to capitol and capitol to Manila \n\n\n Sana 'yan ay inyong gawin  uh the assigned tasks that we should physically protect the the documents\n\n\n Huwag niyong pabayaan 'yan kasi  uh as I said before the first phase has been successful\n\n\nWe now go to the second phase of uh protecting the uh the canvass uh sheets\n\n\nKeep on doing your work and uh uh I guess the people will be grateful to us uh once they realize that we have done uh a job which they expect us to do in the first place\n\n\n At uh ako'y naniniwala na tayo ay nagkakaisa sa direktiba ng ating Pangulong Corazon Aquino na ating pangalagaan ang halalan upang sa ganoong paraan ay masabi natin na ah  the Filipinos have passed a major test in terms of uh political maturity\n\n\nAnd uh this could be the precedent of uh the next elections that will be held in nineteen ninety-five and nineteen ninety-eight\n\n<$B> \n\nYes Sir\n\n\nThank you very much Sir\n\n\nAnd to you Mr. Pardo we would like to commend you for the uh P C C I for remaining apolitical and non-partisan\n\n\nYour briefly your final words\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I repeat that uh uh confidence in the political and economic stability of the country must be built uh\n\n\nAnd more importantly unity must be forged now\n\n\nThe elections of May eleven is now slowly  uh leaving us behind\n\n\nWe must move forward get our act together\n\n\nIt would be very important to to uh think and act as one\n\n\nBoth government and private sectors should now forge ahead\n\n<$B> \n\nThank you to the two gentlemen for joining us this afternoon\n\n\nIna\n\n<$D> \n\nYeah thank you very much too Cathy for joining me this afternoon and in behalf of all the hosts of \" Pollwatch ninety-two \" we will be back at six thirty to bring you regular programming\n\n\nThank you very much for watching and please stand by to find out the initial results of the counting of the ballots  \n\n<$E> \n\nI would like to venture precisely that the winner will win by a comfortable margin because and this is my very private assessment that uh the majority of those who are undecided and even those who have decided but know that they are for the loser follow the principle  everyone loves a winner  \n\n\nThe people I 've heard it said  sayang ang boto ko   sayang ang boto ko  \n\n<$F> \n\nYou think that prevailed\n\n<$E> \n\nYeah I think so\n\n<$F> \n\nYou don't think people voted according to their real choices but rather according to the configuration of who was who was leading the pack\n\n<$E> \n\nPrecisely because the choices were very you know were very poor\n\n\n None of the above  was uh the constant\n\n\nAnd so I think the main psychological basis for choice will be my vote should count and therefore I will be with the winner \n\n<$F> \n\nLarry\n\n<$G> \n\nUh uh another rare occasion wherein I agree  \n\n\nI would like to add that in a lot of in a lot of uh voters the main the main uh motivation is not to let one candidate win\n\n\nYou see\n\n\nOne guy   said yeah  he says I my my heart is for Salonga uh my guts is against Danding therefore my head says vote Ramos \n\n<$F> \n\n It 's it 's preventive   \n\n<$G> \n\nMany people are like that and uh that 's probably the way it 's going to happen\n\n<$F> \n\nUh uhm you agree with that Winnie\n\n<$H> \n\nI uh uh I agree that perhaps that is the rationale that they they follow\n\n\nI don't agree with that rationale at all because uh if you think that somebody should should be President then you should vote for him\n\n<$F> \n\nYeah\n\n<$H> \n\nNo matter what\n\n\nI this concept of winnability makes it all very very makes the whole system all very uh uh prone to being to being influenced by these surveys  etcetera  \n\n\nOne survey another survey   will  know  'no  \n\n<$D> \n\n Well let let   \n\n<$G> \n\nAnd therefore you are you are substituting\n\n<$D> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$G> \n\nYour own thinking for the thinking of what you think everybody else is thinking\n\n\nI I don't like that herd mentality at all\n\n\nAnd I think to the extent that we follow that herd mentality that is to the extent to which we may not be able to vote for the best man or woman\n\n<$F> \n\nOkay well let me ask you did did you yourself follow that principle\n\n<$H> \n\nWhich principle are we talking about\n\n<$F> \n\nVoting according to your conscience or voting according to   everybody else 's  \n\n<$H> \n\n Oh absolutely   absolutely I always practice what I preach  \n\n<$F> \n\nOkay that 's nice to hear\n\n\nAnd I think many people out there probably do practice what they preach\n\n\nOr they could have been doing it according to how they were reading the race\n\n\nWe 'll be back with more on this right after this  \n\n<$F> \n\nOkay  nagbabalik po tayo dito napaka-  heated  nitong  discussion  natin  about whether you voted for your conscience or not\n\n\nAnd Winnie you 're laughing again\n\n\nWhat 's up your sleeve this time\n\n<$H> \n\nBecause you know after Larry went through all that spiel I asked him I said what did you do \n\n\nAnd he said well I actually voted my conscience \n\n\nSo I said to him well if you did that and I did that what makes us think that the other Filipinos will not do that \n\n\nUh good  di ba  \n\n<$F> \n\nYeah\n\n<$H> \n\nI mean you know in the final analysis I think they are an intelligent electorate\n\n<$G> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> is that\n\n<$H> \n\nI 'm not ready\n\n<$G> \n\nI know he votes that way\n\n<$H> \n\nYou know who votes that way\n\n<$G> \n\nThe   Filipino voter  \n\n<$H> \n\n Filipino voters   \n\n<$G> \n\nAs Ernie said they just want to have a candidate that would be the least of all evils   as against another  one who is more evil in their perception\n\n<$H> \n\n My golly  naman    \n\n<$G> \n\nMy God they have to go out of their way to see to it that he doesn't get to be President\n\n<$H> \n\nJust let me be the devil 's advocate\n\n\nI mean how can you make that statement\n\n<$G> \n\nI am not arguing the morality of it\n\n<$H> \n\nNo no no I 'm not I am talking about the historical experience\n\n<$G> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$H> \n\nI 'm not talking about the morals\n\n\nUh if if you remember in nineteen eighty-four everybody thought that uh  candidates would win in Manila\n\n\n Hindi ba  \n\n\nAnd yet they voted against  candidates and Marcos  candidates did not win only five I think out of the twenty\n\n\n Hindi ba  \n\n\nAnd in nineteen eighty-six everybody all the surveys showed that Marcos would win because the question was who do you think is going to win \n\n\nSo they say well we think Marcos is going to win \n\n\nHowever nobody bothered to ask who are you going to vote for \n\n\nAnd even if they thought Marcos was going to win here is the case where they said well even if he is going to win I 'm not going to vote for him \n\n<$F> \n\nYeah\n\n<$H> \n\nSo I 'm not sure\n\n<$E> \n\nI think the big difference is that in the case of Marcos it was clearly good versus evil\n\n\nIn the present case all the candidates really have many pretensions that people just could not act on principle  that 's just what I think\n\n<$H> \n\nOh I 'm not sure about that  \n\n\nI believe that among the seven candidates there was no clear choice\n\n<$F> \n\nThere was no clear choice\n\n<$H> \n\nI cannot believe that\n\n<$F> \n\nOh you can't believe that\n\n<$H> \n\nI cannot believe that\n\n<$F> \n\nSecretary De Villa without putting you in any uh precarious position here\n\n\nDo you think that the Filipino electorate voted according to this winnability concept or do you think people voted according to their conscience\n\n<$C> \n\nThere are two types of Filipino voters out there  \n\n\nThere are those that are influenced by uh by the machine and uh by their  amo  \n\n\nEspecially in the rural areas\n\n\nThe old traditional practice of uh of uh some people out there they still ask their uh their their master   who they 'll vote  for\n\n<$F> \n\n  Sinong iboboto natin    \n\n<$C> \n\n Sinong iboboto natin  \n\n<$D> \n\n Oho  \n\n<$C> \n\nThen there are also a lot of uh of uh very educated voters in the in the population centers\n\n\nThe third factor is there are a lot of young young voters uh who dominate uh uh the the voting power of the country\n\n<$F> \n\nUh uhm   uh uhm  \n\n<$C> \n\n So   when you put all of these together I think that the the the rules uh may somehow not be the same anymore\n\n<$F> \n\nDo you think this election\n\n<$H> \n\nThe bottom line there is that it 's anybody 's guess  \n\n<$F> \n\nYes do you think this election is <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$G> \n\nWell I think the bottom line is what is going to happen a few days from now when they actually tote up the votes then we 'll know whether you 're right or I 'm right  \n\n<$F> \n\n Ganon  \n\n<$H> \n\nAre you trying to tell me are you trying to tell me that the voters are going to vote for Fidel Ramos because they think that he is the least of the evils\n\n\nI think there are voters who   will vote for him because they think  \n\n<$G> \n\n No I didn't say that   \n\n<$H> \n\nUh   but you 're saying  \n\n<$G> \n\n I didn't   say that\n\n<$H> \n\nNo no no no you 're saying you 're right meaning to say that they they 're going to vote their head rather than their heart or their guts  di ba  \n\n\nSo what you are what you are saying is that   the conclusion is that  if if Fidel Ramos wins\n\n<$G> \n\n I didn't say that   \n\n\nI did say that most voters\n\n<$H> \n\nThat people are are protesting merely against say Cojuangco or whatever name they 're pitting against", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3fd1515c-d072-4404-b521-a7b079575404", "added":

kind of a fun bad movie because there are bad movies that are just uh\n\n<$A> \n\nBad\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know a complete waste of time but some movies are so bad they actually border on good 'cause they

tells me it 's a brilliant movie but I saw two minutes and it was just so intense and traumatic\n\n\nI said I think I 'll watch it when I catch it from the beginning 'cause uhm terrible things happen to these animals  terrible things\n\n\nSo  'no  I think you should watch out for \" Babe Pig in the City \" \n\n<$A> \n\nUhm okay I was watching this afternoon just just around twelve uh a movie with let me see Aidan Quinn uh Ben Kingsley   Donald Sutherland  \n\n<$B> \n\n Oh \" The Assignment \"   \n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's \" The Assignment \" \n\n\n  Yes I didn't get the title  \n\n<$B> \n\n That 's

my favorite is \" Scanners \" \n\n<$B> \n\nOh yes I have a special fondness for that movie in which heads explode\n\n<$A> \n\n  Yeah  \n\n<$B> \n\n Brains fly   \n\n<$A> \n\nThe first time I saw Michael  Ironside  was in that movie\n\n\nI love that guy\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah and  di ba  as as Noel Vicious pointed out you know David Cronenberg always the decay of the human body as seen in \" Scanners \" \" The Fly \"   \" Dead Ringers \" \"  Existenz  \"  \n\n\nWhat else uhm\n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm yeah yeah   \n\n\n\" Naked Lunch \" was\n\n<$B> \n\n\" Naked Lunch \" yes although well he also made \" M Butterfly \" which was just embarrassing 'cause there was no way in hell that anyone would be convinced that John Lone was a woman\n\n\nHe 'd stubble  \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay uhm\n\n\nOh hold on\n\n\nWhat do you mean by an indie film an A film and a B film\n\n<$B> \n\nAn \" indie \" is an independently financed movie\n\n\nIt 's usually low budget because uhm you raise the funds yourself\n\n\nYou don't go to a major Hollywood Studio, a studio being some uh a production uh uh a studio like \" Warner Brothers \" or \" Dreamworks \" or you know those things\n\n\nAnd then an A movie would be uhm I guess uh a mainstream, quality, type movie although Jean Claude Van Damme movies are considered A films right\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know  \n\n<$B> \n\nNot necessarily\n\n\nAnd then B movies are just those, think Michael Dudikoff\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah that 's it, Mr B movie\n\n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah what else\n\n<$A> \n\nI don't know\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd and then and there 's also these slight distinctions like David Haselhoff no matter what he does will always look like a B movie actor  \n\n\nNo matter   how much success  he gets on T V he would always come off as B uh uh\n\n<$A> \n\n Okay yeah poor guy   \n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh at least you know at least he can laugh at his own image\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay uhm uhm okay \" Rushmore \" will be shown tonight on \" Star \" \n\n\nOkay thanks for the tip\n\n<$B> \n\nWatch it\n\n\nWatch it\n\n\nIt 's it 's wonderful one of my all time favorite movies\n\n<$A> \n\nStar movies available in \" Home \" \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah we don't get that in \" Sky \" \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah okay\n\n\nUh what can we say about the fact that the Drew Barrymore character in \" Charlie 's Angels \" was airbrushed to give her a slimmer look\n\n\nI don't know if that 's true\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nIs it\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uhm well what 's your problem\n\n\nYou were expecting truth justice and  equality from the Charlie 's  big budget Hollywood movie\n\n\nYour expectations are way too high\n\n<$A> \n\nSpeaking of forgeries someone 's telling us that Leonardo da Vinci was the man behind the\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Shroud of Turin\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah the Shroud of Turin\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I saw that documentary too\n\n\nWho knows who knows\n\n<$A> \n\nPossible\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm possible yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay uh Gilyn Lopez beeped in to say what can you

ball\n\n<$A> \n\nOh geez\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh\n\n<$A> \n\nHorrible\n\n<$B> \n\nHow does that affect your physiological workings to have one testicle\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm you 're fine\n\n\nYou just need one to get by\n\n\nThe other one is for <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nOkay your voice doesn't rise or anything  \n\n<$A> \n\nNah nah and if your vocal cords just settled in it won't change\n\n<$B>

residences or they 've converted official cottages into residences right at the Parks and Wildlife Bureau\n\n<$B> \n\nReally\n\n<$A> \n\narea area just near where we are\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd what is that supposed to be\n\n\nI mean what are what is the purpose of those the   cottages  \n\n<$A> \n\n There   there are cottages there that are used for official functions\n\n<$B> \n\nJust official and not for uh lodging\n\n<$A> \n\nNot for residence\n\n<$B> \n\nOh okay\n\n<$A> \n\nUh it 's supposed to be sometimes\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd how many of those\n\n<$A> \n\nA halfway house\n\n<$B> \n\nSupposed to be\n\n<$A> \n\nFor provincial officials\n\n<$B> \n\nUh okay\n\n<$A> \n\nStaying in Manila\n\n<$B> \n\nWell it 's been it 's been functioning as a hotel also uh apparently\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nOccasionally\n\n<$A> \n\nAs overnight accommodations for for   official purposes  \n\n<$B> \n\n So how many people   are staying there now\n\n<$A> \n\nUh no exact count but uh this batch appointed by the D E N R Secretary uh is over twenty\n\n\nSo that 's about two dozen people\n\n\nAnd uh what is what I find significant is that for two days now this has been appearing in media in print in broadcast and there has been no reaction from the Office of the Secretary\n\n\nFor one we know that Secretary Cerilles is in the Netherlands oh   signing signing  a document uh on behalf of the Philippine government\n\n<$B> \n\n No wonder no wonder   \n\n\nOh well that explains it\n\n<$C> \n\nBut the public affairs people have no reaction either\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause it was the Secretary apparently who uh appointed these people so what can they say\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd so they have to they have to wait for the Secretary\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course\n\n<$A> \n\nTo come back\n\n\nAlthough some other officials are are issuing justifications that uh these these appointments are uh there 's nothing illegal about the appointments\n\n\nThey are contractual and so on and so forth\n\n\nBut I I sense that uh there is a group within the bureaucracy within the old-timers possibly who are who might be jealous because maybe the salaries are bigger or whatever\n\n<$B> \n\nThere 's only one explanation as I said\n\n\nThese people probably need jobs\n\n<$A> \n\nWe need uh a reaction from the Secretary we 'll try to get that when he comes back\n\n\nIn the interest of you know good journalism we get the other side when we can\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course  \n\n<$A> \n\nOf course we 'd like to remind you you are tuned in to D W B R one o four point three\n\n\nThe program is \"  Kalikasan

is correct about an item I read in the newspapers about Fe Hidalgo being appointed to some important position in the department which I 'm sure she deserves\n\n\nA great lady like like Fe Hidalgo\n\n\nEmily I was telling you while we were playing that musical \" Bee is a Bug \" \n\n\nUh I 've been thinking a lot about Howie Severino 's piece that I saw in the \" Probe Team \" \n\n\nThis feature on  muro ami  in uh Palawan\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nWe can discuss  muro ami  uh on another uh plane\n\n\nBut right now I 'm I 'm thinking more of uh this uh in terms of from from the journalistic point of view\n\n<$B> \n\nAs a backgrounder Howie Severino was interviewed by us yesterday   yesterday morning  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yesterday morning   uh\n\n<$B> \n\nRegarding his uh\n\n<$A> \n\nThe segment that he produced for the \" Probe uh Team \", \n\n\nAnd uh the way how he put it he went to Northern Palawan in search of  muro ami  because there were they got tips that  muro ami  a banned fishing method was still being used by certain influential businessmen in in that area\n\n\nAnd uh it turns out as how he himself said, they went there pretending to be scuba diving tourists\n\n\nAnd uh the question that came to my mind is is a journalist obligated to tell uh someone he is interviewing that he may be using this for a television broadcast \n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's the   American way  \n\n<$A> \n\n What what   do you think\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's the American way\n\n\nI don't think that is uh uh practiced in the Philippines, because otherwise they will they will clam up you know these interviewees will uh clam up\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd so\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd so you have to use pretences or you have to pretend that you are somebody else when you 're not, \n\n\n Hindi ba  \n\n<$A> \n\nWell uh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I 'm sure as you said\n\n<$A> \n\nYou are you are sure of that in the U S\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course you have of course even if even while you are talking on the phone   and you want  to tape the conversation   you have to  tell the person the other person you 're talking with that you you 're taping the conversation\n\n<$A> \n\n But how about   \n\n\n You have to tell him   \n\n\nHold it\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't think that happened here\n\n<$A> \n\nBut hold it\n\n\nI have seen television documentaries where uh the commentator himself said this was taken by hidden camera, and if it was a hidden camera it means the the subjects did not know they were being filmed\n\n<$B> \n\nThey were not allowed to but and uh of course they the subjects did not allow it I I mean the subjects did not know it at all\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nProbably and possibly they were not allowed in uh to be interviewed in the first place\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd so they the footage was taken   anyway  and it was aired anyway\n\n<$B> \n\n And they have to squeeze   \n\n\nAnd they have to squeeze uh something from\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd uh uhm the television station was not taken into court\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm yeah that 's true\n\n<$A> \n\nOh   anyway  \n\n<$B> \n\n But   I don't think that 's the the problem is I don't think that that will be used uh in a court of law\n\n\nYou must get a lawyer for this you know\n\n<$A> \n\n Okay anyone out there with uh\n\n<$B> \n\n  Comments  \n\n<$A> \n\n With an      with an opinion  \n\n<$B> \n\n Who 's a lawyer   \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd with uh relevant uh to what we are discussing here uhm I am interested because sometimes we go out to the field   and we do interviews and  \n\n<$B> \n\n So what what you 're saying is uh   Howie should have identified himself\n\n<$A> \n\n\" Should should \" \n\n\nIs the journalist is the reporter, uh required to tell the interviewee that it is going it may be used\n\n<$B> \n\n Siguro  come to think of it  siguro  in this case a hidden camera is uh is is good enough  kasi walang ano e walang  uh I don't think the the this uh <unclear> word </unclear> this uh\n\n\nHow do you call it these companies would want their executives to be uh interviewed on camera  kaya  Howie had to resort to that\n\n<$A> \n\nNo but uh Howie did not use a hidden camera\n\n\nThe the camera was not   hidden at all  \n\n<$B> \n\n Because   he was supposed to be   a scuba-diver  \n\n<$A> \n\n He just   \n\n\nHe just used uh what you might call false pretenses  \n\n\nAnother musical break please Boy  \n\n\nActually Howie Severino, his topic was on  muro ami  \n\n\nUh I\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat about  muro ami  specifically this fishing part\n\n<$A> \n\nI had I had uh, two two people asked me what really is  muro ami  \n\n\nAnd I think Emilia is also asking what what really is  muro ami  all about\n\n<$B> \n\nYes what really is  muro ami  Vic\n\n<$A> \n\nUh this is the way I I I got it from way way back we were fighting the  muro ami  uh thing in in media and in all fronts until it was finally banned\n\n\n\"  Muro ami  \" is actually a Japanese term \n\n<$B> \n\nMeaning\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know you know  dalagang bukid , the the species of fish\n\n\nAnyway it 's it 's coral coral reef dwellers\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nThey come in large numbers and you 've you 've seen television footages underwater\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yes\n\n<$A> \n\nYou you imagine a coral reef plenty of fish and at the edge of the reef you drop a long long huge net\n\n\nBut how do you get the fish to go into the net, so that they get entangled in the net\n\n\nYou drive them into the net\n\n<$B> \n\nBodily\n\n<$A> \n\nBut in  muro ami  they use children, to drive\n\n<$B> \n\nSo they submerge children\n\n<$A> \n\nNo you see the children are actually  uh swimming on on the surface of the water\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBut they are holding what they call \" scare lines \" \n\n<$B> \n\nScare lines\n\n<$A> \n\nGoads\n\n<$B> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$A> \n\nBut at the end of the scare line are heavy things like steel or rocks or lead\n\n\nAnd they pull   this  up and down\n\n<$B> \n\n And down   to scare the\n\n<$A> \n\nSo that it hits   it hits  the corals\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh huh   \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd sound is magnified many times when it 's under water\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nIt reverberates\n\n\nSo you can imagine how scared this   this fish  are they they scamper in all directions but there there is no escape\n\n<$B> \n\n  Dalagang bukid    \n\n\nBecause the net is there already\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause this is this is a long line of children abreast \n\n<$B> \n\nHuh\n\n<$A> \n\nMoving towards the net\n\n\nAm I giving you a   good enough  a good enough picture\n\n<$B> \n\n Oh sure   yeah clear as mud\n\n<$A> \n\nBut in the process the corals are broken and uh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut the end result is what they want,   the  dalagang bukid   \n\n<$A> \n\n The end result   is they   get a lot of fish  okay\n\n<$B> \n\n They get the  dalagang bukid    yeah \n\n<$A> \n\nUh fast track a little bit\n\n\nSometime in the mid eighties we succeeded in having uh the the this method banned in the

most of the rest of the country\n\n\nI find it inconceivable that the will of the country should give way to the will of the Senate\n\n<$Z> \n \" special edition \" The Bases What Now \" \n\n \n\n<$D> \n\nThe new bases treaty now under public debate is officially called \" The Treaty of Friendship Cooperation and Security between the Philippines and the United States \" \n\n\nIt is a wide-ranging pact on a number of fields such as military economic and cultural relations\n\n\nThe M B A was agreed upon by the Philippines and the U S in nineteen forty-seven shortly after World War Two\n\n\nIt provided for the use of Clark Air Base Subic Naval Base and smaller military facilities by the Americans for free\n\n\nThe Treaty was originally to be in effect for ninety-nine years \n\n\nIn the middle sixties however the duration of the Treaty was cut to twenty-five years\n\n\nLater the datelines were also reduced and during the Martial Law years a compensation package was added, \n\n\nBy virtue of the redemption of the life of the M B A it will expire next September sixteen and according to the new Constitution no foreign troops and facilities will be allowed in the Philippine territory after that date without a new treaty, \n\n\nPursuant to the M B A and the Constitutional provisions President Aquino notified the U S government about this time of last year that the Philippine government was terminating the M B A\n\n\nThis signified to the Americans that if they wanted to retain their bases here they will have to seek another treaty as stipulated by the Philippine Constitution, \n\n\nThe Americans agreed to a renegotiation of the M B A and formed a panel headed by Richard Armitage\n\n\nOn the part of the Philippines the President appointed Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus to head its panel\n\n\nThe first meeting of the two panels produced no results, \n\n\nThe Philippines presented demands for a bigger compensation package than that provided in the revised M B A\n\n\nArmitage responded by insulting, stating that he was not prepared to enter into a cash register negotiation and went home\n\n\nHowever he left behind a technical staff that continued exploring points of agreement with its Philippine counterpart, \n\n\nThe bases talks were resumed middle of this year\n\n\nThis time an agreement was reached but there were still many issues that were unresolved\n\n\nLast month the Philippine and U S panels announced the negotiations were over and that except for a few minor changes in the draft the Treaty would be initialed soon\n\n\nThe terms announced however met with objections from the Senate which by law must ratify the Treaty before it can go into effect, \n\n\nEven as the negotiations were going on Mount Pinatubo erupted rendering Clark Air Base useless to the Americans who announced they were leaving the base next year\n\n\nThe Treaty that would be sent to the Senate for ratification calls only for the retention of the Subic Naval Base\n\n\nFor its use the U S promises two hundred fifty-three million dollars a year as military assistance but no specific amount for economic aid\n\n\nThe treaty only provides economic assistance by the U S in the form of help in getting more loans at concessional terms greater access to American markets of Philippine exports and the like\n\n\nNo money involved\n\n\nMalaca&ntilde;ang and the U S Embassy have mounted a lobby for its ratification\n\n\nSome Senators have softened their stand but under the latest version that has been released to the public it might be rejected\n\n\nUnless of course the U S would offer other benefits for the use of Subic\n\n\nFor \" Options \" I 'm Doris Bigornia  \n\n<$Z> \n This special edition of \" Options \" shall focus on comments and opinions solely attributable to the speakers\n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nGood evening\n\n Tonight Tony Abaya Rudy Romero and myself will go slam bang on the issue of U S military bases\n\n\nLet me start by saying that until very recently I had been pro-bases\n\n\nI figured that five to seven years more of the bases would not inflict too deep a wound on Philippine sovereignty\n\n\nMy reason was that the Philippines needed aid and financial assistance very badly\n\n\nWe were bleeding profusely and certainly we could use substantial American payment for the U S bases\n\n\nNow, substantial rental for me and many Filipinos then was something in the amount of six hundred million to one billion U S dollars\n\n\nThis amount over five years could tide us over\n\n\nBut Mount Pinatubo erupted last June and suddenly I saw the face of an America that shocked me that saddened me\n\n\nThe American negotiators led by uh Robert Armitage scaled down our rental demand to two hundred three million dollars\n\n\nInstead of sympathizing with a country that was badly battered by the Mount Pinatubo eruption they seemingly took advantage of our misery and said two hundred three million dollars take it or leave it, \n\n\nAs far as I am concerned I leave it for reasons of national pride self-respect and dignity\n\n\nI don't want us to remain on our knees with a begging bowl in hand resigned to the thought that we cannot exist for the next ten years without the bases without Uncle Sam and without the almighty dollar\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh from my point of view I have always been for the bases uh for a maximum of five to seven years and only if the arrangement will be economically beneficial to the country\n\n\nUh I don't believe that the bases were put here to protect the Philippines\n\n\nThey obviously were put here to protect American and perhaps Japanese interests\n\n\nAnd uh as far as compensation is concerned I start with the original Philippine demand of eight hundred uh twenty-five million dollars a year which was broken down into a hard component of four hundred million dollars and a soft component of four hundred twenty-five million dollars a year\n\n\nNow this compensation demand was based on negotiations for two bases\n\n\nNow with the explosion of Mount Pinatubo Clark Air Base has been rendered inoperative so the negotiations were reduced to only one base\n\n\nSo the original Philippine demand of four hundred million dollar hard compensation has been halved and the working figure is two hundred three million dollars a year which is slightly more than the original Philippine demand\n\n\nNow the soft compensation unfortunately was not inputted into this bases uh agreement but uh according to the \" Far Eastern Economic Review \" this soft compensation amounts to eight hundred and thirty million dollars which added to the two hundred three cash component comes out to slightly more than one billion dollars a year\n\n\nI think it is a fair business deal and we should go ahead with it\n\n<$C> \n\nOutside of the question of the legitimacy of the uh Marcos government and his hold on power during the fourteen period fourteen years period of Martial Law I can think of no issue in this country that has taken us that has been more characterized with characterized by greater passion and emotion during the last forty-five years of our independence than the bases issue\n\n\nThis issue has divided uh has resulted in divisions on five fronts\n\n\nIt has divided one branch of the government from another\n\n\nIt has divided the military from the civilians and it certainly tends to it is certainly threatening to\n\n\nIt has divided one half of the legislature from the rest of the citizenry\n\n\nIt has divided the Philippines from its principal ally which is now the only superpower in the world\n\n\nAnd it has of late been shown to have divided the business community from a part of the legislature\n\n\nCertainly this has been a very distracting issue since the uh start of the, uh Aquino administration the President 's enunciation of a I 'll-keep-my-options-open stance and the start of the uh discussions what the so-called discussions at the start\n\n\nOn the business front investments have been on hold and major business decisions have been postponed, \n\n\nThere has been a tendency there has been a perception that from the very start the focus of the discussions of the bases has been diplomatic and legal and that that of late it has only shifted to the economic\n\n\nI this is a mistaken perception from my point of view, \n\n Given the weakness of our economy the focus of the discussions has always been on the economic\n\n\nRatification or rejection by the Senate in the next few weeks would not mean the end of the treaty issue\n\n\nUh in the forth there 's the forthcoming elections to reckon with nine months from now and the people will perform their own ratification rite when these candidates who vote against both for or against the Treaty will come up for re-election\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay now that the three of us have jumped into the bases debate I think we should start our slam bang by an inquiry into how these uh military bases in the Philippine really started\n\n\nAnd I say that it started because of the cold war that emerged after World War number two\n\n<$?> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nWait wait I 'm just talking about the general treaty on American-Philippine relations\n\n\nI can go back to that also\n\n\nIn nineteen forty-six July four because there was provision for the existence of Philippine bases\n\n\nBut let me finish my point\n\n<$?> \n I 'm sorry\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'm saying you see that bases as part of the international network of the United States due to the Cold War between communism and democracy started you see very early and John Foster Dulles was the architect of bases all over the world that could as a matter of fact help the mission of rolling back the communist danger\n\n\nAs a result of which bases in the Philippines became very important for American strategy by putting up the United States as the policeman of the globe\n\n\nThat is what how it started\n\n<$?> \n The policy of containment\n\n<$A> \n\nYes the policy of containment the world over\n\n<$B> \n\nLet me just add some historical notes\n\n\nThe Subic Bay the Subic Naval Base was an originally a Spanish naval base which the Americans took over when they took over the Philippines and Clark Air Base used to be Port  Stotsenberg  which was set up I believe in the thirties before the second World War\n\n\nNow the Bases Agreement then started after Philippine independence nineteen forty-six\n\n\nThat 's true uhm, while the Cold War obviously had something to do with it\n\n<$A> \n\nIt had everything to do with it everything  \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd the opinion now is the uh the Cold War is over\n\n\nThat may be so but  I would say temporarily  lamang  we don't know what 's going to happen within the next five years\n\n\nSo the the uh the intrusion of the Cold War politics into the Philippine situation I think is still valid up to now whether or not the Cold War is in fact started is uh still extant or not\n\n<$A> \n\nCome on Tony you know the Cold War is over\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's over temporarily\n\n\nIt may be temporary you know what happened in we don't know who would have won in the the  \n\n<$C> \n\nCommunism is crumbling\n\n<$A> \n\nIt is\n\n\nIt is like Humpty Dumpty that has split into a million pieces\n\n\nIt has no way of returning back to power and you know that and we know that\n\n<$B> \n\nUh another historical footnote I was reading the other day as a matter of fact something that uh Mr Vicente Pacis wrote\n\n\nIt has something it was his reminiscence Osme&ntilde;a 's reminiscence of something that Quezon said during the last days of the war when he was in exile in the U S and at that time my  my understanding from what I read is that the President the late President indicated that the Americans who were still uh  our outgoing masters then  that he was amenable to the grant of the continued stay of the bases

{"text": "<$A> \n\n\" The President 's Hour \" continues and our\ntopic for this half of the program is the continuing struggle for human\nrights\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen the uh Aquino administration has made human\nrights uh one of the uh cornerstones of its program\n\n\nAnd uh we are pleased to have with us uh some of the top human\nrights officials uh in this uh government\n\n\nWell we start with uh Secretary of Justice uh Franklin Drilon\n\n\nWe have uh Commissioner Paulynn Sicam of the Commission on Human\nRights and uh Commissioner Jesito Mallilin of the Commission on Human Rights\n\n\nWe also have a reporter from \" Probe Team \" Mr\nDavid Celdran uh who 's also a television personality and sometime uh\nsociology teacher okay\n\n\nAnyway uh Secretary Drilon the uhm human rights record of the uhm\nadministration has been a topic of some controversy\n\n\nUhm of course it was an anchor of the opposition uhm platform\nagainst Marcos in nineteen eighty-six\n\n\nBut since then uhm internationally the Philippines has taken a\nbeating uhm in uh in its uh human rights record uh perhaps uh fairly enough\n\n\nAnd uh that 's what I want to ask you uh where do we stand now\nbecause uh the the big issue about a year ago when I was covering human\nrights was that the human rights record of the Aquino government was worse\nthan the uh Marcos government\n\n\nAnd that 's what the uh the uh various elements abroad were trying\nto uh spread around\n\n<$B> \n\nI take exception to that that the human rights record of this\nadministration is worse than Marcos\n\n\nThere you know it 's basically the fact that you have freedom of\nspeech now freedom of the press and all these things are reported in the\npress who do not know really what happened in the Marcos regime\n\n\nAnd more  but most importantly Apa on in in matters\nof substance this administration as a matter of policy has never tolerated\nhuman rights violations\n\n\nI must emphasize that we 're in an insurgency with an insurgency\nproblem such as ours, human rights violations happen\n\n\nThat you know we do not deny\n\n\nWhat is important the difference between President Aquino 's\nadministration and that of the previous regime is that when we take action we\ndo not tolerate we hale  violators of human rights\n\n\nWhereas before uh although they were saying one thing they were\ndoing another\n\n\nThey were saying that we do not tolerate this but in point of fact\nit is happening and nothing was being done about it\n\n\nAnd we can be proud of the fact that indeed this administration has\nuh has uh put substance to the policy on protecting human rights\n\n\nWe have shortcomings I must admit uh uh in this area\n\n\nBut uh it 's not because we we do not want to do it but because of\ncircumstances which uh prevent us from from uh doing everything that we want\nto do\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay now let 's focus on the particular issue of uh military\noffenses\n\n\nI think it might be uh uh perhaps the central issue in uh in human\nrights here uh\n\n\nDave uh you just did a story uh which I caught on on \" \nProbe \" \n\n\nWhat was your experience uh up there in Isabela\n\n<$C> \n\nWell we 're talking about the uh tape of uh Marag Valley\n\n<$A> \n\nMarag Valley\n\n<$C> \n\nIn Apayao area\n\n\nAnd uhm true enough no uhm it was an investigative piece and we\nwent there uhm\n\n\nWe did interviews and we talked to the the uh local government\nofficials the military\n\n\nAnd the finding around there is that yes there have been uhm\nextreme cases of human rights abuses\n\n\nNow apparently the context we find these abuses  'no\n\n within is that, in counter-insurgency operations or military\noperations the biggest losers are the civilians who are caught in the\ncrossfire\n\n\nNow I would like to throw back the question to our commissioners\nand the uh Secretary here\n\n\nWhat guarantee do civilians have in a situation of\ncounter-insurgency operations\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah and uh uh how can you prevent human rights abuses uh\nperhaps exactly <unclear> words </unclear> victims all the time\n\n<$D> \n\nWell you know uhm a group of us went to Marag Valley in April\n, and uh one of the things that we uh that we found out was that exactly\nthat, the people are the helpless uh victims  'no  \n\n\nThey 're caught in the crossfire\n\n\nAnd one of our recommendations which we submitted to the President\nthrough uh Secretary Drilon is that there should not be uhm aerial  bombardments\n\n\nSuch such a thing should be banned from the uh tactics of the\nmilitary uh especially when you know there 's even uh the the danger of being\none of one civilian being there uh\n\n\nNow we 've  planned  this recommendation among others to uh\ncluster E to the President so\n\n<$B> \n\nWell yes uh that 's correct\n\n\nWe I I I 've received in my capacity as uh chairman of the cluster\nE uh the report of the mission which incidentally uh was the was part of the\nmission who <unclear> words </unclear> centered to Marag Valley\n\n\nAnd uh these uh recommendations were discussed this afternoon in\ncluster E among which was the suspension of the offensive military operations\nin order to allow government services to come in\n\n\nIndeed the finding of the mission was that might be that the last\ntime uh the people of Marag Valley felt government 's presence was probably\nin nineteen eighty-five\n\n\nAnd uh the suggestion of the mission that was sent there was that\nwe uh bring back the credibility of government through government services in\nMarag Valley\n\n<$D> \n\nBut Frank uhm this this recommendation to stop military\noperations does this apply only to Marag or is this going to apply to all\nother areas where military operations are displacing civilians\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh I find difficulty answering that uh you know I am not\nfrom the defense establishment\n\n\nWe must also consider what kind of operations they 're having in\nother areas\n\n\nThey have also their own mandate their own uh interest to and and\nduties to perform\n\n\nWe we we uh I I don't think that we tolerate this policy of bombing\na a anywhere\n\n\nBut uh uh  in this particular case it was only focused on\nthe Marag Valley\n\n<$A> \n\nWell uhm the uhm problem I see with that is that the military\nis probably going to react uh rather uh uh negatively to that suggestion\nbecause uhm aerial bombardment while it it poses a very real danger this is a\ncornerstone of military strategy\n\n\nIt uh cuts down on their own uh casualties like by let 's say  \nsocking  an area before they go there\n\n\nAnd if they 're asked to cut it out that 's you know in in effect\nasking them to to uh to go in there uhm sort of uh it 's a more dangerous\nsituation\n\n\nAnd uh if they 're not going to be happy about this uh how can you\nconvince the military that uh such uh tactics or or or even even calling off\nmilitary <unclear> word </unclear> in populated areas are necessary\n\n<$D> \n\nYou know Apa some military strategists would tell you that\naerial bombardment goes against the uhm the uhm the total approach  ba\n\n that they call it\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$D> \n\nIt goes against that because you alienate the population right\naway while what you 're supposed to do is come in there and be their friend\n\n<$A> \n\nSure but the S O P is a long term strategy here we 're talking\nof a a short term conflict let 's say you 've isolated a group of of uh as\nthe military calls them uh uh \" communist terrorists \" they\nreally have their own terminology \" C Ts \" \n\n\nUhm you know uh let 's say uhm you 've isolated a group of them\nthere and and uh you 're gonna go in after them you know\n\n\nThat 's that 's not an S O P case\n\n\nI mean you know when I go in there and talk to the villagers and\nsort of get their sympathies you wanna go in there and start shooting right\nuh\n\n\nAnd that 's what I 'm talking about I think that uh necessary\naerial support uh and aerial bombardment is is uh very key to uh a to modern\nwarfare\n\n\nAnd it seems to me that the military might not agree that uh they\nshould call it off\n\n<$C> \n\n As regards  that in an interview that I did with the\nuhm with General Templo he said that operations will resume soon\n\n\nWhat 're just needed are for the fact finding missions to come in\nand once the reports are  returned  they intend to push through with\nthe uh military operations\n\n\nAnd second uhm it is very difficult no uhm lots of human rights\nabuses take place because of what 's called you 're guilty by association\n\n\nNow here 's a populated area of tribal people and I 'm not I 'm not\njust talking about Marag\n\n\nIn fact with every other hot spot in the country insurgents by the\nby the uh fact that they engage in guerilla warfare do operate within densely\npopulated areas\n\n\nAnd because of that uhm it 's very difficult for military\noperations to take place\n\n\nNow is there any way that the military can of course isolate or\npinpoint who uh the enemies are and who the civilians are\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's exactly it\n\n<$B> \n\nBut the moment you do that then uh human rights advocates\nwould charge the military with hamletting they try to remove the civilians\n\n\nAnd uh you know precisely to protect the civilian population and\nagain uh human rights advocates uh charge them with uh hamletting again a\nhuman rights violation\n\n<$C> \n\nWhich is which is why I 'd like to bring up the idea that\nperhaps pure military operations or the military approach to solving the\nproblem of insurgency is already defunct  as has been proven by Vietnam and by so many other third world\nexperiences\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd I agree with you that the only way to uhm solve the\nproblem is to bring government services sincerely and not just as propaganda\nbut sincerely bring government services to the people\n\n<$A> \n\nI I said uhm that uh that is part of the S O P formula we 're\ntalking here about about military uh conflict  'no  \n\n\nI mean I I think that there there 's agreement around this table\nthat that is in fact the the only uh viable long term approach to the problem\n\n\nBut let 's talk about military engagement let 's talk about\nshooting war because that 's where we 're really concerned with with human\nrights violations uh I think\n\n\nUhm I remember very clearly the case of those uhm young marines who\nuh who uh were one morning in Bulacan uh around this house\n\n\nAnd and they shot up the house\n\n\nThey claimed they were shot at from the house\n\n\nThey were on patrol across uh some fishponds and ricefields and\nthey were firing out like this and there was this this house right next to a\na fishpond and they claimed they were shot at from the house\n\n\nAnd they shot up the whole house and uhm there there was a claim\nthat there were civilians there and that these people had died\n\n\nAnd uhm you know in these cases you know what what are you going to\ndo what are you going to say I mean that 's uhm that 's uh what I 'd like to\nknow\n\n\nUh perhaps uh you can tell us how the Commission on Human Rights\nreacted in that case I remember we we conducted that inquiry right in the\nDepartment of Justice\n\n<$D> \n\nI think   that the  \n\n<$A> \n\n Mr Mallilin <   you were involved <unclear> words\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$E> \n\nI believe the early solution of this case what we call the\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> massacre and uh\n\n<$A> \n\nIsn't the massacre sort of uh <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$E> \n\nIt 's the <unclear> words </unclear> massacre\n\n\nBut uh the Commission came up with a resolution absolving uh the uh\nmarines in that uh incident\n\n\nThough I would say that I had the lone dissenting view there I\ndidn't agree with the resolution\n\n\nI thought there should be more a thorough investigation of this\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm how was the case investigated I mean this is all after the\nfact\n\n\nUh was it a very tedious process\n\n<$E> \n\nNot really we were able to call uh the marines immediately\nthose involved <unclear> words </unclear> and even uh General Biazon\ntestified and then we called in the doctor who autopsied the bodies\n\n<$A> \n\nAha\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd after that we had our own evaluation <unclear> words\n\n</unclear> even the owner of that fishpond we were able to have him testify\nand give his side\n\n\nBut there are still questions being asked\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy did you dissent\n\n<$E> \n\nWell uh\n\n<$A> \n\nAny particular reason\n\n<$E> \n\nI believe that there was really a massacre and uh you know\nwhere the bloodstains were they were just in one position\n\n<$A> \n\nAha\n\n<$E> \n\nThere were no bodies found in the upper floor of the house\n\n\nThey were all in one place so I said these people were not\n\n<unclear> words </unclear>", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4ec5bd38-30f6-4f07-9f57-a0eb6be7e428", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.110391+00:00"}

you also\n\n<$A> \n\nMadame Vice-President the question we would like to ask among others is that, was your decision to break away from the Estrada cabinet as uh Social Welfare and Development Secretary a personal one or a party decision\n\n<$B> \n\nA combination\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nGene because for a long time now certain party leaders and leaders of other parties and other groups\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nHave been pressuring me to resign\n\n\nBut it is my practice it has been my practice throughout my political career\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nTo always to be consulting with the people on the ground\n\n\nAnd in the earlier months when I would be having this pressure from certain party\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nColleagues and others to resign when I would check it on the ground that was not it was not jibing with my feedback from from the common people\n\n\nWhat the common people then wanted was that because the government was in trouble the country was in trouble then I should help\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI should help by the by from from the inside\n\n\nBut in the last two weeks, that feedback changed\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd the people that I consulted asked said that it is time for me to leave the administration because my being inside does not help\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBring about stability at all and in fact uh therefore it is time for me to take my role which my colleagues had been asking me to take\n\n<$A> \n\nWe always love to ask the question whenever a decision is made or whenever a decision is about to be made is this, is it always hard or did you did you have a hard time deciding to leave the Estrada cabinet\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know Gene what is always hard is to  to discern what is the will of God because that 's always been my my tradition and part of the will of God is expressed through the people\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause of course they voted for me and they can   dictate  to me <unclear> words </unclear> the confluence of events\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it 's really you know this is a lot like sin where you can discern the will of God\n\n\nI mean you choose will you will you commit adultery or will you not\n\n\nWill you steal or will you not\n\n\nThose are very black and white decisions\n\n<$A> \n\nYes, the choice between right and wrong is very clear\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYes, but when you talk about do I resign or do I stay \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThen then you really have to go through a process of prayerful discernment which which I went through because you don't know you don't know whether what is going through your mind is really what is the right thing to do\n\n\nSo   you  pray and you wait for the confluence of events to guide you and that 's what I had to do\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nIf I got your statement correctly the statement in which you declared your resignation from the Estrada cabinet\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nYou said something like it is now untenable for you to be with the Estrada cabinet or it is untenable for you\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I did not\n\n<$A> \n\nTo stay in the cabinet\n\n<$B> \n\nI did not use the word \" untenable \" \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI can no   longer  continue to serve in the cabinet \n\n<$A> \n\n Okay   \n\n\nUh uhm \n\n\nso by staying in the cabinet before\n\n\nYou want to help the   government  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   yes that 's right\n\n<$A> \n\nNow it 's a different story\n\n<$B> \n\nThings have turned from the  from the point of view of the people who voted for me as Vice-President because you   see  Gene I also have this attitude\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nThat as cabinet member I was accountable to the President and I and I like to believe when I was cabinet member I was accountable to him and   and  I was a good team player but as elected Vice-President of the people I am accountable to the people as well\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nDirectly to them\n\n\nAnd the time came when there was a conflict between my accountability to him\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd my accountability to them\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd so therefore I had to choose the higher accountability which was what I was elected for\n\n<$A> \n\nBefore you were pressured as you have pointed   out  by   your  political   party  mates\n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n Yes   \n\n\n Yes   \n\n\nMany   colleagues yes  \n\n<$A> \n\n The people   \n\n\nSome people   in the government  \n\n<$B> \n\n Some people   some people no outside government\n\n<$A> \n\nOutside of government\n\n<$B> \n\nYes some but but not you know in my process of consultation not with the vast majority\n\n<$A> \n\nYou were called names\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd   yet  \n\n<$A> \n\n When you   were in that position\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd yet I stuck to my  my point\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause I was confident\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThat I was I I I I had been listening to the people\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd they agreed with me in fact I I get I got my signals from them\n\n\nYes that 's why as long as I know that I 'm doing right\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd as long as I know that what I 'm doing is what is dictated by the people they can call me names but that 's the way it is\n\n<$A> \n\nIs your decision in any way linked to the controversy as exposed by Ilocos Sur Governor Luis Singson\n\n<$B> \n\nIn a  \n\n<$A> \n\nThe  jueteng  issue\n\n<$B> \n\nIn a sense Gene yes\n\n\nBecause prior to the, prior to the controversy that was raised by Governor Singson\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThe people said \" continue to serve \" \n\n\nBut when Singson came up with his expos\u00e9 the people were so enraged that they didn't want me to serve anymore\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay, by saying that would it be fair to conclude that you believe Governor Singson\n\n\nYou believe the charges or you still doubt it\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I  I want to try to be sober and to say that it 's not what I believe that matters\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThere are investigations going on\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThe more independent they are the the more we will know the truth\n\n\nBut the thing is it is between the  the people and and what I should do my proper role in government\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it is not what the President should do\n\n\n  It 's  what I should   do  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n Yes   \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd the people wanted me to get out and join the opposition rather than stay in the cabinet where I was not contributing anymore to stability\n\n<$A> \n\nHow do you describe the pulse of the nation now\n\n\nBecause if you look at surveys and there were two surveys\n\n<$B> \n\n Oo  \n\n<$A> \n\nWhich came out just recently \" Pulse Asia Incorporated \" and then we have the \" Social Weather Station \" and both surveys show that there is still support for the President\n\n<$B> \n\nWell   yeah  \n\n<$A> \n\n They   still believe in the President but well you have decided   because  you heard the people\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nBecause it was I mean I 'm not saying that you see, they 're two different things\n\n\n  They they  maybe the majority may not want him to resign\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut they wanted me to resign from his cabinet\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay uh uhm so there is no conflict between\n\n<$B> \n\nBetween those findings\n\n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nThose findings by survey groups the scientific uh methods determining   what  the people think and what you heard from the people\n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nThat brought you to decide   and leave  the Estrada cabinet\n\n<$B> \n\n That 's right   \n\n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nPerhaps what they want now from me\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIs to invigorate the opposition because in the past that was what that 's what they were saying the opposition was in doldrums because they had   no  leader\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd perhaps though the people might still as the surveys show want him there perhaps they want somebody who will take the lead in being more in bringing vigor to the opposition\n\n<$A> \n\nMadame Vice-President allow me to mouth\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nThe uh well the words of Malaca&ntilde;ang that your resignation from the cabinet the situation we are in now the expos\u00e9 of Governor Singson is part of a grand conspiracy to destabilize the Estrada administration\n\n<$B> \n\nI I 'm not aware of any such  \n\n<$A> \n\nThat you are playing into that conspiracy by resigning\n\n<$B> \n\nWell if it  if it was a question of playing into some conspiracy or other then I should have\n\n<$A> \n\nDone it before\n\n<$B> \n\nDone it before\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay uh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut this is coming from the people and not from any particular at this point in time\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nParty member who whom I could not say no to\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm but are you surprised to hear those kind of response from Malaca&ntilde;ang to the uh situation now\n\n<$B> \n\nNo   I 'm not  \n\n<$A> \n\n Is that   uh an effort in futility in desperation because they can't find anything else   to  \n\n<$B> \n\n Well   I don't want to judge\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause they have their answer and and all I can say is from my knowledge\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm not aware of uh any from personal knowledge I 'm not aware of any move to destabilize\n\n<$A> \n\nFormer President Ramos former President Aquino Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin have demanded the resignation of President Estrada but you haven't issued a statement on that explaining that you cannot make a statement on the resignation because you would be the  you would benefit from   such  act\n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n<$A> \n\nBut, have you thought about this whether you would really make one or not\n\n<$B> \n\nA statement\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAs long as I 'm\n\n<$A> \n\nIn support or\n\n<$B> \n\nAs long as I 'm the beneficiary I don't think it 's proper\n\n\nIt 's it 's  delicadeza  \n\n\nI don't think it 's proper to make a comment except to say that I will follow the Constitution\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm speaking of propriety or or or or courtesy some people hit back at you for for resigning abroad\n\n\nYou should have considered courtesy on the part of the President to say it in front of him or when you 're in the country\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I was I talked to him on the phone\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo so I did uh resign personally\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm \n\n\nOkay, the thesis of this discussion is is there a Caesar 's wife in this government that could take over in the wake of the questions on the morality the leadership and the kind of governance governance of this uh incumbent administration and well I don't know where it 's coming from but there are rumors and I 'll be more bordering on rumors speculations or even libel or even black propaganda\n\n<$B> \n\nExactly how it is\n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nBut it is public interest and people want to know\n\n\nThey 've always said that if it 's the Vice-President who will replace President Estrada then it would be worse because\n\n<$B> \n\nNo not\n\n<$A> \n\nThey 've been pointing out the  jueteng  connection\n\n<$B> \n\nNot the not they have always said Gene\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nPresident Aquino does not say that Cardinal Sin does not say that  Reforma   does not say\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n Promdi   \n\n<$A> \n\n Promdi  \n\n<$B> \n\nDoes not say that\n\n\nSo it 's not they have always said \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm well I 'm referring to the detractors   your detractors  \n\n<$B> \n\n Well okay   the detractors yes because what can they find about me except that I am a town mate of Bong Pineda and his wife who is the mayor of my home town\n\n\nAnd many years ago I was  ninang  in in the wedding of her son one of four that I attended that day\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich I couldn't even stay for the ceremony because I had to go to the next one\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I also asked Cardinal Sin about that\n\n\nWhat what is the what is a Christian 's role if you are asked to be the  ninang  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOf the son of somebody with a dubious dubious reputation\n\n\nAnd he said it is your Christian duty to accept because the sin of the father is not the sin of the son\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm but your your uh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut\n\n<$A> \n\nYour being there\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nBrought

of August and if so what will be the amount of the price decreases\n\n<$B> \n\nTeddy the President has been very clear from the very beginning exactly where we stand, and that is there can be no oil price reduction until the O P S F deficit is wiped out\n\n\nAnd she has also said before, that it will be more prudent if we 'll allow a little bit of a buffer to be built into the O P S F\n\n\nAfter that uh her options have always been open but uh the problem now is uh we have a number of uh spending priorities that will have to be met especially in the light of Mount Pinatubo uh the eruptions of that volcano which are continuing\n\n\nWe do not know how long those eruptions are going to continue so the damage is going to be there and we have to face up to those spending priorities\n\n<$A> \n\nMr Secretary August fifteen or thereabouts you will announce some price reductions\n\n\nWhat would be the magnitude of those price reductions\n\n\nIn your mind right now Mr Secretary\n\n<$B> \n\nIn my mind if I talk in terms of uh preferences I would like to have uh an average of a fifty uh centavo per liter uh reduction\n\n\nUh there is an arithmetic to that uh Teddy\n\n\nIt is that we are committed to making this economy grow and in order to be able to do that there is one thing that we will have to do and that is cut that import levy which is beginning to hurt because that was the only source of revenue\n\n\nAnd I would like to see a fairly respectable cut to that maybe four percentage points\n\n\nNow for every percent that we cut of the import levy, that costs the national government two and a half billion pesos\n\n<$A> \n\nA lot of money huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo if you 're going to make a <unclear> words </unclear> cut that 's going to cost ten million pesos\n\n\nIn addition we have a problem of <unclear> words </unclear> which is going to cost us about seven billion pesos a year\n\n\nThat brings up the cost to the national government of something like seventeen billion plus the immediate repair and uh reconstruction that that we really have to do in Central Luzon because of Mount Pinatubo\n\n\nThat comes to about eighteen million pesos\n\n\nAnd that 's the reason why I 've been suggesting we 'll have to be very prudent we will have to uh calculate our moves very very well because a complete rollback would simply throw away some of the gains which good luck is providing to the Philippine economy right now\n\n\nAnd if I give away fifty centavos on average per liter that will be only six billion pesos out while I can keep the eighteen billion pesos through a <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$C> \n\nAssuming assuming uh Mr Secretary assuming, since you give away fifty uh fifty centavos per liter on the average assuming no new taxes no further eruptions anywhere what kind of deficit are we talking about by nineteen ninety-one\n\n<$B> \n\nTony we are still talking about a twenty-six billion peso deficit which is what is in the program\n\n<$C> \n\nOh we 're on target\n\n<$B> ICE-PHI:#28> Very very much within target as a matter of fact we are ahead of target because during the first uh semester we what we decided to do was really to manage the system very conservatively\n\n\nAnd so we 'd have a little bit of <unclear> words </unclear> uh for us to be able to catch up during the second semester\n\n\nDon't forget that during the first uh six months the economy was growing very uh by a very small percentage uh just about zero\n\n\nAnd now this is the time uh to pick up\n\n\nAnd we can let government take the lead through precisely the public infrastructure program that we should finance\n\n\nAnd we still stick to the twenty-six billion peso deficit that we have targeted\n\n<$C> \n\nMr Secretary you said that the government is prepared to give an average rollback of fifty centavos per liter\n\n\nHow does that translate for example in diesel in fuel oil premium gasoline how much would uh each one be pushed back\n\n<$B> \n\nTony that depends very much on how the distribution is going to be made\n\n\nUh this is going to be a very difficult decision because almost every group that we talked with would have a different set of suggestions\n\n\nBut the basic problem we have since we have intervened into the pricing of various oil products\n\n\nWe have an anomaly right now where our relative price for diesel is low and our relative price for gasoline is high\n\n\nAnd as a result we 're importing a lot of diesel into the country while we have   gasoline  which is in surplus\n\n<$C> \n\n A surplus   of gasoline \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd which we do not know what to do about\n\n\nSo obviously if you go by the base on the basis of uh <unclear> word </unclear> market economics we should be uh cutting more on gasoline and so much less on diesel\n\n\nAs a matter of fact in other countries they have what they call as a \" mono \" price for both diesel and gasoline\n\n\nBecause it 's fairly easy to shift from one use to the other\n\n\nSo if the differential is very big then there 's a tendency for people to use more of the cheaper priced diesel and that 's why we 're running short of that we 're importing and uh they would use less of the dearer priced gasoline\n\n<$C> \n\nBut the fifty centavos uh average that you 're proposing to roll back assuming for example that diesel will be lowered by average forty centavos that is really very minimal\n\n\nIt has no effect on the prices uh situation\n\n\nSo that I think those who are proposing a rollback will not be happy with such a a an infinitesimal reduction in prices\n\n\nWell of course I I agree with your point of view that these measures are necessary but uh there seems to be a lack of uh uh enthusiasm on the part of the government to explain its policies in terms that people at the lower socio-economic levels can understand and appreciate\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I hope that we can do a better job of explaining the realities of our economy to our people because after all this is our common affair\n\n\nBut uh  we do not have to theorize very much about it\n\n\nWe have had three experiences of an oil price rollback since nineteen eighty-seven and in every case it did not lead to a reduction in\n\n<$C> \n\nExactly yes\n\n<$B> \n\nJeepney fares\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIt did not lead to a <unclear> word </unclear> of transport fares and the cost of living certainly did not uh, decrease\n\n\nAnd what is even worse is that within three months because the government built up a huge deficit then the interest rates started going up the economy slowed down and prices increased\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo people who are saying that uh uh if you cut oil prices now you will cut the prices of other commodities\n\n<$C> \n\nIt doesn't happen\n\n<$B> \n\nDo not seem to remember that we 've gone through those experiences already and in every instance since nineteen eighty-seven prices after three months instead of going down actually went up\n\n<$A> \n\nMr Secretary if I may temporarily shift tone of this interview because I don't want to forget\n\n\nUh you and  Executive Secretary Oscar Orbos were supposed to have engaged in a shouting match  in a cabinet meeting\n\n\nThe shouting match that uh eventually led to his uh resignation from the cabinet\n\n\nMr Secretary was there really a shouting match and would you kindly tell us uh if it was, this and other things that led to the  to Secretary  resignation\n\n<$C> \n\nIn other words who shouted louder than who  \n\n<$B> \n\nI think it 's a very unfair uh question to Secretary Orbos\n\n\nUh for the simple reason that uh the Secretary of Finance does not have that power uh just because even if it were true that uh there was a shouting match I don't think a cabinet secretary uh resigns simply because the Secretary of Finance shouts at him or her\n\n\nIt just isn't so\n\n\nThe fact of the matter is that there was never any shouting match uh in that cabinet meeting uh we had a very friendly discussion and to my mind that was one of the driest cabinet meetings that I 've ever attended so it required a wild leap of imagination for anyone to say that there was a shouting match\n\n<$A> \n\nYou have been identified Mr Secretary as a key member of an anti-Orbos cabal that was uh supposedly whispering anti-Orbos propaganda into the President 's ear\n\n\nWould you kindly react to statements like that Mr Secretary  \n\n<$B> \n\nI think the President makes her own determination of uh the cabinet members and their performance\n\n\nShe does not need anybody to tell her how a cabinet member is performing and it is not in uh the habit of various cabinet members and myself included uh to be speaking badly about uh anyone in the cabinet\n\n\nAs a matter of fact the President sometimes uh pulls my leg and jokes me uh as to the praises that I heap on uh the various cabinet members whenever they have something very good to present I always manage to uh say a kind word\n\n\nAnd so I don't ever remember having shouted at any time in the cabinet and much less uh at Secretary Orbos with whom I 've been very friendly\n\n<$C> \n\nThank you Mr Secretary we 'll pause for a brief break  \n\n\nMr Secretary the resignation the forced resignation of Oscar Orbos obviously did not happen in a vacuum or in an isolated condition\n\n\nThere must have been a build-up of ill-will somewhere along the line\n\n\nWould you uh, give us some information on what this minor or major incidents prior to the resignation may have been\n\n<$B> \n\nWell Tony the relationship of a cabinet member with the President is a very privileged uh relationship and I cannot pretend to know all of the details of that relationship\n\n\nIt is a matter that is personal between the President and the cabinet member concerned\n\n\nWhat I can say however is that uh when Secretary Orbos was appointed Executive Secretary uh he certainly had the uh best uh, uh kindest uh thoughts from the President\n\n\nWhat happened since then I really do not know but uh as a member of the cabinet I can say that we have had very many discussions many suggestions for improving this and that, and uh I personally did not have uh too many uh disagreements with Secretary Orbos\n\n\nI did give him a lot of suggestions as I suppose all the other other members of the cabinet have given the same set of suggestions but in the end it is not we uh that determine uh whether another cabinet member will resign or would tender his or her resignation\n\n\nThat is a matter purely between him   and the President  \n\n<$C> \n\n And the President   \n\n\nObviously the President decides but uh uh the perception is that uh at the time that Mr Orbos was uh uh invited to the cabinet Mrs Aquino was thinking of uh uh preparing him for the presidency\n\n\nI mean he she had very good uh uh perceptions of his abilities but somehow there has been a complete change in in this uh uh image of Mr Orbos uh\n\n<$B> \n\nI 'm not sure Tony whether there has been any real complete change\n\n\nI can tell you that uh Secretary Orbos is a young man uh with a very good fresh kind of image\n\n\nAnd I 'm sure that it is an image that has attracted the President that has attracted me and has attracted a whole lot of people and he certainly raised uh the hopes and expectations of a whole lot of people \n\n\nUh what happened since again there uh it can be a matter of speculation but probably this is a matter that will be best left to Secretary Orbos and the President\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay I 'll not press you anymore,  \n\n<$D> \n\nLet 's go back to this famous meeting at which he was supposed to have shouted louder than Secretary Orbos or vice versa\n\n\nThis meeting at which the levy and the rollback of prices were discussed presumably were not the only meetings at which these subjects were discussed, \n\n\nWhat was the, participation of the other members of the cabinet in this and did you get the sense that that majority of the cabinet is behind taking a firm stand on this, movement and this agitation for uh, a substantial cut in the levy and a rollback of oil prices\n\n<$B> \n\nRudy as you know we have uh a small group within the cabinet that uh takes lunch with the President on Mondays\n\n\nAnd it was on that Monday for the week that uh Secretary Orbos tendered his resignation when uh there was some discussion about uh gasoline prices oil prices import levy and I remember very distinctly that uh there was no disagreement over principle\n\n\nUh Secretary Orbos has been in favor of the cut-down of the import levy and I 'm on record as being in favor of the phasing down of the import levy", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL",

Marita Villafuerte, uh agreed to have us look at her studio and of course the factory where she 's doing her thing\n\n\nShe 's now into stationery and greeting cards\n\n\nSo here we are at Marita 's uh, little place here\n\n\nIt 's so exciting\n\n\nIt 's such a cozy studio\n\n\nAnd uh Marita first of all welcome to our show, \n\n<$B> \n\nThank you for inviting me\n\n\nIt 's a pleasure to be here in your show\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd well you know that stationery is a very major ingredient in any store around the world any store\n\n\nIt is one of the items one of the top ten items that stores around the world stock up, \n\n\nAnd uh I 'm very very happy that you are in this field\n\n\nAnd uh of course from the work that you 're doing we can see that there 's a lot of influences from the area where you come from\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom Bicol\n\n<$A> \n\nYes, uh probably you can tell our, viewers what exactly inspired you to use a lot of these materials\n\n<$B> \n\nActually since we own a printing publishing firm ever since I worked for them in college I 've been uh printing greeting cards and stationeries which I market locally\n\n\nSo at the moment I 'm supplying fifty bookstores\n\n\nBut uh since my Mom is a regular lecturer in export and I see a lot of her clients coming here consulting her about export and you know she has this export fever actually it 's her it 's her ambition for all her children to go into export\n\n\nSo she was the one who encouraged me to venture into this business\n\n\nAnd uh I know that our province my Dad being Governor of Camarines Sur I saw a lot of uh raw materials that has a lot of potentials\n\n\nBecause, the province of Camarines Sur is well endowed with a lot of resources like especially the  abaca  and uh bark and uh the the materials which I use for the handy paper which is  cogon  grass and uh so many things so many exotic indigenous materials, \n\n\nSo, I decided to venture into making, handcrafted greeting cards with uh something Filipino in it using Filipino materials\n\n<$A> \n\nYou actually don't have a fine arts uh\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't have   any  background\n\n<$A> \n\n Background   \n\n\nNo background at all, \n\n\nSo how does these designs, you know get to to be developed\n\n<$B> \n\nActually I feel like a pseudo-artist because, I 'm a designer because of force of circumstance\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut uh I just imagine I have a very imaginative mind so I didn't really believe that I could do it but my Mom was the one who encouraged me she said I could do it so anything anything under the sun is a, stimulus already to me stimuli really\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo I think I have this card mentality\n\n\nAnything I see I try to adjust it in a what I can make out of it\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo a card or a wrapper or a stationery\n\n<$A> \n\nI see and now uh one of the things that I think was very interesting in what you 're doing is that you have started to put uh music\n\n<$B> \n\nYes  \n\n\nThis is locally available uh the electronic components are made here in the Philippines\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm and uh you don't have any problem at all uh incorporating them in all of your designs\n\n<$B> \n\nUh, the very first time I did because I didn't know how to install it\n\n\nAnd you know I didn't know the technical aspect\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut when I consulted the one installing the music I had to adjust some of my designs\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n<$B> \n\nSo I can fit the music\n\n<$A> \n\nI I see so the those things you have already uh, somehow, gone over the   hump  of those problems\n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n<$A> \n\nUh I notice also Marita that you not only do greeting cards and uh, you 've also ventured into stationery items\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nLike the all-purpose uh,   cards  and uh slowly you 're getting into wrapping   gift wrapping  \n\n<$B> \n\n Cards   \n\n\n Uh-huh wrapping paper   \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n\nSo can you tell us more about that\n\n<$B> \n\nWell actually since I 've been uh actually these designs that I have which I recently, uh shipped to Australia, these designs I I actually sell locally, but uh the Australian buyer asked me what else do I do so I just showed the wrappers and all the stationeries that I do and she told she asked me to design for her\n\n\nSo I made some new designs for her and I made some wrappers for her because it 's the in thing actually\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh uh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nThere 's a big demand for cards wrappers and stationeries\n\n<$A> \n\nYes well many of the materials that you have here now are really, indigenous to uh the Philippines\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nUh you 're also using handmade paper and uh the other one is pine  'no  \n\n<$B> \n\nYes pine corrugated board\n\n\nIt 's recycled paper actually\n\n<$A> \n\nUh really  ha  and uh is this recycled paper already readily available also or someone else is doing it\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nOh that 's nice\n\n\nSo uh, when you are actually thinking\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nOf some of the designs, somehow how how do you, get this to to finally get into uh production\n\n<$B> \n\nActually I start with a concept, \n\n\nI think of the occasion and then I start uh I start thinking of ideas and then I let it incubate in my mind\n\n\n'cause sometimes there are there are designs which took days or weeks some months\n\n\nBut there are some designs that I already have the concept I just sit down I play with the materials and all of a sudden there 's the design already\n\n\nSo it really depends but all the while I just keep my eyes open and look for stimulus\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom anything anything actually from fabric or, anything actually anything under the sun  \n\n<$A> \n\nSo how about your the people helping you you know the workers\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh since this is a family business the printing I mean some of the workers knew me since I was still a kid, \n\n\nActually they never realized that one of these days I 'll be the one I 'll be the one managing the press\n\n\nBut ever since I took over the company two years ago I started  recruiting young people\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause uh I have uh easier, easier time dealing with them because I 'm also young\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut the old people I retain them because they 've been loyal to our company they 've been here for about fourteen years already\n\n<$A> \n\nThere 's nothing that is wasted in this place you know Marita actually uses all the tiny little bits of, pieces and you know and uh swatches and uh whatever she can get hold of to make into things\n\n\nAnd uh you can almost see a whole line of wreath done in three dimensional\n\n<$B> \n\nThis is one of my collections\n\n\nIt 's called \" the wreath collection \" \n\n\nIt 's actually one of the favorite and most saleable and marketable probably because of the, season because Christmas is the most favorite season I suppose, \n\n\nSo uhm the wreaths are made of different materials\n\n\nThe paper again I use uh some for some are made of handmade paper and some are corrugated corrugated boards because I 'm marketing or selling this to different kinds of countries and uh these countries have different tastes\n\n\nUsually the Europeans and the Australians they prefer the natural which is the fine corrugated board\n\n\nAnd the Asians they love the pastel colors of the handmade paper\n\n\nSome some wreaths wreaths are made of garlands, some are made of  abaca  twine, some have stockings, some are made of uh, beads, so, I consider this collection as east meets west because, they look native but I injected some uh western, styles and I put also some high-tech elements like the electronic music with lights\n\n\nLike this one, \n\n\nThis is one of the designs that I uh shipped to Oman that 's in Middle East, \n\n\nThis one is also one of the favorites the pearls\n\n\nIt 's something different\n\n\nIt 's uh not the traditional green and red Christmas, \n\n\nIt 's a wreath made of white lavender and pink\n\n\nLavender is actually my favorite color and I 'm I 'm happy that when I participated in CITEM this is one of the favorites\n\n\nIn fact all the eight countries that I shipped to they ordered this\n\n<$A> \n\nI know there are several women who regularly watches the show and always look for something that they could do and probably in their spare time they could also do this as a hobby\n\n\nMarita how long has this been going on\n\n<$B> \n\nThe export   business  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n<$B> \n\nI started actually just last year\n\n<$A> \n\nLast year\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd my d\u00e9but was when I joined the CITEM\n\n\nThe \" Thirteenth Market Week \" \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm and uh since then you 've received buyers from\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nFrom other countries\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\nI 've had uh the most important thing for me even though I 'm starting very modestly is that I 've had the opportunity to enter the market in eight countries\n\n<$A> \n\nEight countries right away\n\n<$B> \n\nEight countries\n\n<$A> \n\nOh that 's good\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd at the moment I 'm already corresponding and answering some inquiries from other, prospective buyers\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\nAnd what is the most saleable uh, item that you have right now\n\n<$B> \n\nThe most saleable I have is the wreath collection and also the twine collection\n\n\nThis uh weaving\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\n  So we do some weaving  \n\n<$A> \n\n And now   which countries uh particularly like this\n\n<$B> \n\nUsually the Asians and the Australians\n\n\nMay maybe because it 's very simple\n\n\nThey find beauty in it\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo they like it\n\n<$A> \n\nBut of course Marita is not only in stationery, uh Marita is also in puppetry  \n\n<$B> \n\nUhm that 's true\n\n<$A> \n\nSo we have asked her to to give us a sample\n\n\nShe 's a member of what what 's the puppetry\n\n<$B> \n\nUh I 'm, a member of Puppeteers Association of the Philippines\n\n\nIt 's a two-year old non-stock non-profit organization\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm and you have members all over the country\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nWe 're composed of different active puppet groups and uh, the members are classified from professional to hobbyists to students educators\n\n\nI 'm one of the hobbyists actually, \n\n\nAnyone interested in puppetry can call us at eight three three zero seven seven eight\n\n\nThey can look for me, \n\n\nIf they 're interested to learn the art of puppetry we conduct regular puppet workshop\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo we teach children\n\n\nWe teach teachers educators and professionals\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen does this happen\n\n<$B> \n\nMonthly actually\n\n\nWe schedule it and it 's also upon invitation\n\n\nSo we also go on provincial tour\n\n\n Hello\n\n\nHow are you\n\n\nHi Mom\n\n\nIt 's my first time on T V\n\n\nYey I 'd like to greet

my make-up\n\n\n Ay nagkabaliktad 'ata 'yon ah   \n\n<$A> \n\nOne of the items I uh that caught my fancy was that packaging item that you were doing\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nSo Marita can you tell me something about what, your plans are in this area\n\n<$B> \n\nI have about three kinds of packaging, \n\n\nThe first is the traditional this is the envelope and then uh I have another kind of envelope which is expandable because some of my products are two-dimensional or three-dimensional so it 's protruding\n\n\nSo I use expandable envelopes\n\n\nAnd another thing is this one, \n\n\nThis is the new kind of  packaging that I make, \n\n\nIt 's almost like a gift, because I believe especially in Europe and in Australia the U S and Canada they uh they, value the cards that they receive\n\n\nThey keep it and they display it during Christmas and other special occasions   \n\n<$A> \n\nWhat is in a name\n\n\nThe first time we heard about the company called \" Abstraction \" you

on the heels of widespread reports that he had a shouting match with Finance Secretary Jesus Estanislao on the issues of oil price reduction and a cut in the import levy and his ambitions to run for President in nineteen ninety-two, \n\n\nBut he dispelled the rumor that he had presidential ambitions or be a senatorial candidate\n\n\nBut reports have it that he is being approached by several

bit too secretive too mild and maybe did not really address some of the issues that were presented there\n\n\nBut if you will notice in the last couple of days an article has appeared in a number of newspapers where our guest today made some rather strong and very interesting criticisms against the handling of the economic policy of this country\n\n\nLet me start with his conclusion which is going to start uh which is going to form the basis of our discussion this evening\n\n\nWhat he said  What we need is a new stabilization program based not on ad hoc and ill-conceived measures but on sound economic principles that is consistent with our people 's modest needs and not simply those of our financial creditors and that builds on a social consensus for reforms rather than tearing apart the fabric the fabric of democratic society \n\n\n We need such a program today   \n\n\nTonight we are going to ask our guest about the details of this particular article and his views which may give us a clue as to what really happened in terms of that very very fabled and uh talked about resignation recently\n\n\nWe will be right back after this  \n\n\nOkay welcome back to uh \" Viewpoint \" \n\n\nWell uh how shall I call you uh Atty  Pa&ntilde;ero  Oscar Orbos uh former Executive Secretary Oca  \n\n<$C> \n\nYeah Dong just plain Oca I guess uh\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay well Oca you know uh, I know there has been a lot of commentary on your previous appearance on uh my good friend Louie Beltran 's \" Straight from the Shoulder \" \n\n\nAnd uh you made it a point not to be drawn into a war of personalities or of trying to uh make certain characterizations on personal motives\n\n\nNow I 'd like to respect that but at the same time I think as we 've discussed earlier we 'd like to talk more about the process and the matter of policy consideration\n\n\nBecause that 's what 's important about this particular issue\n\n\nWe leave to another day the question of uh even the matter of presidential ambitions and all that\n\n\nBut on the other hand what I find somewhat interesting is the conclusion that you made in this series of articles that you 've written recently\n\n\nAnd I 'd like to talk about that because it has everything to do with economic policy and how it affects the people particularly those that are less uh less privileged in life  'no  \n\n\nBut uh before that Oca let me ask you about this dichotomy this difference that people are making between what is popular and allegedly what is right\n\n\nI mean even the President made a big uh made a lot of reference to this in her State of the Nation address\n\n\nIt appears now that there is a contrast between at least insofar as people in government are concerned between what has to be popular or what what is popular and what has to be done which just seems to be right\n\n\nSo how do you view this\n\n\nIs something that 's popular not necessarily right or vice versa\n\n<$C> \n\nWell uh Dong uh in this case I can say that uh, accidentally what is popular is right\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd it is not necessarily the case that uh what is not uh  unpopular uh is right\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nUh I think uh the fundamental issue is here is uh the interest of the country\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nIt 's not who is right and who is wrong uh academically speaking\n\n\nBut uh we have to be sensitive as to the needs of the people and what the economy would need at uh at a given moment\n\n\nYou know the economy Dong as far as I can see it is a living thing\n\n\nYou know you you have to respond immediately\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nI mean there are things that uh you cannot delay\n\n\nNow uh in this particular case well the issue on the oil price and on the levy is uh very symptomatic of uh on certain differences uh on the overall policy\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nUh in this case in our economic stabilization program\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay now, the uh what has happened thus far as we talked the uh I N C demonstration yesterday the date of the State of the Nation address has been aborted  'no  \n\n\nIt was preempted in a way\n\n\nSo really what happened yesterday was it was not with some exceptions not a very very uh you know difficult day in terms of the uh in terms of the demonstrations that could have would could have occurred\n\n\nBut this represented in the minds of many people a reversal of government policy\n\n\nIn the beginning people thought that government was dead set against and you were still there okay people thought that government was dead set against any kind of reduction in the in the oil price in oil oil prices\n\n\nThen because of the threat government came back and said we 're going to reduce after all \n\n\nAnd then later on when you come back in your article you say that the price reduction should have been more\n\n\nIt should have been one peso and eighty-two   centavos  rather than the   average of one peso  \n\n<$C> \n\n And   \n\n\n And Dong   it should have been earlier\n\n<$B> \n\nIt should have been earlier\n\n<$C> \n\nWhat I 'm saying is that our economic managers shouldn't have should have not brought uh this country to the brink\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nI remember as early as uh four months ago when you know in our monitoring uh of some of the indicators in the economy we were suggesting already a cutback uh on the oil prices and a cutback on the levy\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nThis is uh a necessary measure we thought, uh in order to calibrate the easing up already after a constrictive uh period\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd it was very important Dong because uh by then we thought that the economy has been squeech squeezed uh too much already\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd that uh this was unnecessary\n\n<$B> \n\n let 's take it step by step\n\n\nIn the beginning is it true that there was a real conflict of opinion between those that were saying precisely what you 're saying that the time had come when perhaps a rollback a reduction in price was appropriate and those that said that under no circumstances would there be a reduction until the O P S F uh deficit was completely wiped out and a surplus and a buffer so-called was achieved\n\n\nWas there such a conflict\n\n<$C> \n\nYes uh as to the timing uh Dong uh our sense then as early as uh four months ago is that the economy could uh actually tolerate uh a little easing up after a constrictive uh period\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd that uh well one of the measures would be to cut back on the levy so that uh cost would go down and already maybe addressing uh the oil price\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nBecause even then we were anticipating that by August uh the deficit would zero out and that uh we could afford already a cutback uh a reduction uh in the price\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd that we did not have to wait for August to do this\n\n\nUh well in effect uh what we wanted to advocate was instead of asking the people to be patient we would be asking the oil companies to be a little patient because they would be paid anyway\n\n<$B> \n\nIn other words rather than having the O P S F subsidy zero out in August they would have to wait until a few more months later\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nIn September\n\n<$C> \n\nThis was uh a proposal\n\n\nOf course we went through a number of proposals because we are a team\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd we work uh within uh certain uh parameters\n\n\nBut uh the more fundamental issue here if I may say so Dong is that uh the targets uh we have committed ourselves to the I M F at two point five percent uh deficit uh to G N P ratio\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nWas too constrictive\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd that in fact under the Krugman Report we could be a little more liberal maybe bring it up to five percent\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd that all of this uh what mindset about meeting targets uh to me  uh is really uh well a serious crime because uh we would be killing the economy\n\n\nWhile it 's true we could talk about long term you don't have to kill the short term for the long term\n\n<$B> \n\nSo what you 're saying is that the concern about maintaining certain targets uh maintaining deficits within certain guidelines number one was also resulting in a lot of other difficulties for the economy itself\n\n<$C> \n\nOh yes uh Dong uh in fact uh many of my colleagues in the cabinet uh have been heard uh to complain about uh lack of money lack of funds for schools for bridges uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nTo deliver services we had to lay off people\n\n\nUp to a certain point uh there was a need to belt-tighten\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nBut beyond that if we have to constrict some more uh my position was that well it 's going to kill the economy\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat about the argument that these uh restrictions these guidelines had to be met because otherwise we would not uh comply with the stabilization program which we had agreed to under a Letter of Intent in which in turn would lead to problems regarding new money for the Philippines\n\n<$C> \n\nBut you know Dong uh that 's precisely the debate\n\n\nYou could rework the program uh with these creditors and justify it\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nThere 's nothing sacrosanct about numbers committed to the IM F\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nWe have to be sensitive\n\n\nWe have to attend to the welfare of our people and it 's for us to explain to them that in fact the economy could uh afford a little more uh liberal uh movement towards spending more\n\n<$B> \n\n let 's let 's analyze a little bit of that\n\n\nWhen you say you could spend a little more that it was too constrictive\n\n\nGive us some details to that\n\n<$C> \n\n  For instance  \n\n<$B> \n\n To what extent   was it constrictive\n\n<$C> \n\nFor instance Dong uh if we maintain the same targets now, we would be foregoing the use of about twenty-eight billion pesos\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nIn foreign-assisted projects\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nUh because uh we would not release the counterpart funds because by releasing these counterpart funds we would be going over the deficit targets\n\n<$B> \n\nYou mean twenty-eight billion pesos could have been devoted to more projects in this economy right now\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd that means uh lesser opportunities lesser employment lesser activities  etcetera  \n\n<$B> \n\nTwenty-eight billion could take the form of what for example infrastructure projects\n\n<$C> \n\nInfrastructure\n\n\nUh there could be some other livelihood programs uh environmental uh uh promotion  etcetera  \n\n<$B> \n\nSo so in other words you were not convinced or at least when you were arguing for this position uh you were not convinced that these deficit maintenance targets uh were necessary in order to convince the creditors and maybe even the I M F that we were still still well within our ability to be able to pay back all of those obligations later on\n\n<$C> \n\nExactly Dong\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh okay\n\n<$C> \n\nUh those are the premises\n\n\nAnd besides at that point uh it has to be a calibrated measure\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C> \n\nYou know I was saying all along that uh if we keep on with these targets uh and we insist on the nine percent levy and we insist on the on the <unclear> word </unclear> percent uh uh price structure of of oil and gasoline products what will happen is that in in fact we will have inflation we will have unemployment and uh the reasons for all of these uh why they were put in place, revenues, is not happening", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

before but not so much now  but anyway okay it 's Christmas here on the set but we still have a lot of things to tell you\n\n\nIn fact today we 're premiering our health portion on the show so every Friday from now on you can count on us to give you the latest developments and information in health news that affect not only your health but also your families as well and uh your health update is supported by Generation E from Mead Johnson\n\n\nHelp make your kids part of Generation E exceptional and extra-smart  and of course somebody who 's exceptional and extra-smart is Alex \n\n\nShe 's gonna give us a health update Alex  \n\n<$C>  \n\nOkay thank you very much uh Alex and uh we will be going to this serious health issue in detail as we speak with the  pediatrist  uh from the intensive care unit of the Makati Medical Center Dr Michael Wassmer\n\n\nGood morning\n\n<$D>  \n\nGood morning\n\n<$C>  \n\nOkay uh so uh this is not a good thing to say that business has been pretty  uh I mean it has been pretty busy for you nowadays\n\n\nHow many patients do you get on the average per day per week\n\n\nLet 's say dengue related\n\n<$D>  \n\nUh there 's a lot of uh admissions and a lot of uh kids who are getting admitted in the hospital on a suspected case of dengue\n\n<$A>  \n\nOkay\n\n<$D>  \n\nAnd uh some of those uh recover quite fast and the others uh require more intensive uh monitoring where uh in an I C U setting\n\n<$C>  \n\nDo you have a number ten a day twenty a day\n\n<$D>  \n\nI would say at least ten a day\n\n<$C>  \n\nTen a day\n\n<$D>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$C>  \n\nHas it grown through the years like last year it 's less and before that or is it still the same\n\n<$D>  \n\nUh the number of admissions basically is uh the same but uh what differs is that uh as before that it was occurring on certain months\n\n\nNow we 're seeing dengue uh earlier like it 's a uh whole year illness as compared to before that we used to see them only in the rainy season\n\n<$C>  \n\nWhy is that\n\n\nIs that a weather thing\n\n\nIs that uh\n\n<$D>  \n\nUh I 'm not so sure on what the actual cause is\n\n<$B>  \n\nThere 's classic dengue D H F and then there is the dengue shock syndrome\n\n\nCan you define please\n\n<$D>  \n\nOkay when you say uh dengue fever this is basically a child who has had fever for three to five days and has basically all the symptoms of a viral infection like a cold a cough and everything and basically uh because of the persistence of the fever they consult their doctor uhm and uh when they do some blood test uh it shows that uh there is a reduction in their platelets and everything which could be classified as dengue fever\n\n\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is basically uh more like the child has actual bleeding like nosebleed gum bleed uh G I or gastrointestinal bleed\n\n\nDengue shock syndrome is basically uh there 's no bleeding\n\n\nYou don 't see any bleeding but there 's massive loss of fluids in the body and therefore uh the blood pressure could go down <unclear> word </unclear>  the hypotensive and this would affect the other organs in the body\n\n<$E>  \n\nWhat causes this the dengue shock syndrome\n\n<$D>  \n\nUhm well it 's basically a uhm immune-related uh it you the virus creates a reaction in the body which causes uh inflammation and it releases a lot of uhm what we call chemical mediators which uh basically uh uh drops your blood pressure and uh affects your other organs in the body\n\n<$C>  \n\nDoc Bam Bam Bam was saying a while ago that uh he he was a victim of dengue twice as a kid   < [> and he  said he thinks it 's because he was a plump fat kid\n\n<$D>  \n\n\n Yeah  \n\n<$C>  \n\nDoes does that have a connection, the chubbier kids get hit get infected more or something\n\n<$D>  \n\nNo uhm when uh actually uh, it affects everybody regardless whether they 're fat or they 're\n\n<$E>  \n\nUh-uhm\n\n<$D>  \n\nSkinny young uh\n\n<$E>  \n\nKid or adult\n\n<$D>  \n\nKid or\n\n<$E>  \n\nThere 's this notion  na  kids  lang 'eh  \n\n<$D>  \n\nNo no even adults in fact a lot of adults uh have dengue\n\n<$E>  \n\nUhm\n\n<$D>  \n\nThe only reason is that they don't normally uh adults don't normally go to the doctor right away\n\n\nThey try to self-medicate and uh\n\n<$E>  \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$D>  \n\nAnd before they know it  yun pala  they already have uh dengue\n\n<$E>  \n\nUh-uhm\n\n<$D>  \n\nBut basically it affects  all types of children\n\n<$C>  \n\nI see\n\n<$B>  \n\nDoc uhm how do we detect dengue\n\n<$D>  \n\nUhm the only way to detect dengue is to basically have a uh blood test done  e  \n\n\nUh basically uh it 's it 's called uh uh C B C or complete blood count with platelets and uh if you monitor that and uh if your platelets are dropping then you are a dengue suspect\n\n\nAlthough this can happen in other illnesses as well\n\n\nThere are certain tests like a dengue blood test or an  Elyssa  test which can be done but basically this can only be done uhm after the fifth day of the fever\n\n<$B>  \n\nSo  kunyari  uhm I noticed uh that  kunyari  my my uh little girl or boy has fever\n\n\nDo I bring him right away to the doctor since I know that this is the month  na yung maraming nagkakadengue 'no  \n\n\nThe rainy season, is it okay to bring him right away\n\n<$D>  \n\nYeah well early consultation with a physician is always important\n\n\nUh they uh have the skills to basically identify uh which children uh have uh a high risk or a high prospect for for dengue especially like uh when we examine the child and basically the child has very very high fever and yet uh on physical examination you do not see any locus or any area in which uh the child may have where the fever is coming from\n\n\nThen uh this child basically is a dengue suspect until proven otherwise\n\n<$C>  \n\nWhy why are pediatricians uh the best people to go to aside from I mean as compared to other doctors\n\n\nEven even if you 're an adult you still go to the pediatrician for the dengue because they are supposedly the specialists in dengue\n\n<$D>  \n\nWell it 's because basically uh we handle so many cases a year of uh of dengue so we are basically uh more attuned in uh identifying uh patients with dengue although uh when it comes to adult I think an internist will be in the same realm as a pediatrician in uh diagnosing dengue\n\n<$C>  \n\nOkay\n\n<$B>  \n\nCan I just call my doctor and say my my son or my daughter has this high fever and these are the symptoms can I treat uh that at home\n\n\nCan I treat that kind of sickness at home\n\n<$D>  \n\nUh I think it would be best for the child to be brought to the pediatrician because uh the pediatrician will have to make a decision whether the child has to be admitted and observed in a hospital setting or can be managed at home\n\n<$E>  \n\nIs there a vaccine being uh made for this 'cause I know there 's a flu vaccine and there 's hepa  so is there a vaccine being\n\n<$D>  \n\nI think they are doing initial studies or initial trials on a vaccine for dengue although I think uh it 's  it 's a little bit difficult because we are not dealing only with one strain there are several strains of dengue so therefore in order to create an effective vaccine it has to be effective for all the different strains of dengue\n\n<$C>  \n\nAnyway uh before we wrap this discussion up uh Dr Mike maybe give it to us in black and white maybe in just uh tips for the viewers at home uh you know before they leave the house they have to work  na  important things they should remember maybe just some several things that uh they should do or should not do uh with relation to dengue\n\n<$D>  \n\nWell uh uh I would recommend to all mothers and uh to all mothers or uh adults who have uh children or themselves persistent fever of more than three days uh or who have have episodes of nosebleed or gumbleed or feeling very very weak uh to please consult your doctor at the earliest possible time so that the necessary uh tests could be done in order to identify whether you have dengue fever or not\n\n<$B>  \n\nOkay alright thank you\n\n\nAnd uh well thank you very much Dr Wassmer\n\n<$D>  \n\nThank you \n\n \n\n \n\n<$Z>  \n Welcome back to \" Points of View \" \n\n We 're talking about whether using one 's native uh tongue in the educational system\n\n Cultural Foundation\n\n \n\n<$A>  \n\nOkay so you were saying  na Mrs Santos na mali daw ang ano mali ang sinabi naming  uh policy in terms of the DECS\n\n\nNow what is the real policy of the DECS\n\n<$B>  \n\nUh the real policy is that we 're just using the  lingua franca  \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Oo  \n\n<$B>  \n\nAs a pilot for a pilot study in sixteen grade one classes in sixteen schools in the region\n\n<$A>  \n\nAs a pilot project\n\n<$B>  \n\nIt 's just a pilot project wherein we are going to use uh Tagalog\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$B>  \n\nIn the in the areas where Tagalog is widely spoken Cebuano in the regions where Cebuano is widely spoken and in Ilocano\n\n<$A>  \n\nIlocano\n\n<$B>  \n\nWhere Ilocano is widely spoken\n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$B>  \n\nUh from our roster of schools uh there will be eight which will be using Tagalog\n\n<$A>  \n\nAlright\n\n<$B>  \n\nFive which will be using uh Cebuano and three which will be using Ilocano    as a medium of instruction  for all uh grade one subjects\n\n<$A>  \n\n\n But is this right right    \n\n<$B>  \n\nBut in the second quarter we will just we will be starting them with oral <unclear> word </unclear>   'no  and probably oral English if they are ready\n\n<$A>  \n\nBut this is does this indicate a direction  na  eventually you really want to widen the scope of uh of Filipino as a medium of instruction in all elementary schools\n\n<$B>  \n\nWell if uh the results of the study would show that the children will be learning better in the  lingua franca  then probably we could well not just immediately a policy but we could widen the scope of the experiment\n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Pero ngayon hindi ba  they are already using Filipino    in terms of certain subjects like uh  Sibika  mga ganon hindi ba  \n\n<$B>  \n\n\n They are using Filipino    \n\n\nYeah they are using Filipino for uh  Sibika at Kultura  \n\n<$A>  \n\nYeah\n\n<$B>  \n\nUh \" Good Manners and Right Conduct \" but uh and of course Filipino as a subject and reading in Filipino\n\n<$A>  \n\nUh huh\n\n<$B>  \n\nAnd they use English for Mathematics and for Science and English as a language but in the    lingua franca  experiment we will be using we are not abandoning the bilingual program\n\n<$A>  \n\nRight right\n\n<$B>  \n\nBut we are just using the  lingua franca  as a bridge from the home setting to the school setting from the known language to an unknown language\n\n\nUh uh we are using the  lingua franca  as sort of a bridge so that the children can be led step by step to the new language to a new setting in the school rather than plunging them directly    to something that is not  \n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Alright whether gradual or uh      whether gradual and then do you know uh modulated and all that  pero ang katotohanan nito  we 're really going towards a policy where English will be de-emphasized and more Filipino will be implemented\n\n<$B>  \n\nOh no I don't think so\n\n\nUh we are still uh as I said we are not abandoning the bilingual uh policy we are just finding out a way by which we could teach English better probably if we start the children in a lingua franca\n\n\nMeaning in a language    that is  not new to them\n\n<$A>  \n\n\n Yeah    \n\n<$Z>  \n \n\n<$B>  \n\nUh we are looking forward to the time when when they learn because I think studies show that if the child learns the concept in his own    native language  there is better transfer to the new language\n\n<$A>  \n\n\n In his own native  oo      \n\n<$Z>  \n \n\n<$B>  \n\nI hope we hope that we can that that they will learn English better because I believe there are so many studies    that have already been conducted  \n\n\n\n Oo  so for example\n\n<$A>  \n\n\n   Pag naintindihan na nila pag naintindihan na nila saka na mas madali    \n\n\nYeah  pero  excuse me  lang  I 'm sorry\n\n<$C>  \n\nHow do we evaluate success uh because if correct me if I 'm wrong but uh it 's it 's been done I remember when I was a kid\n\n\nUh an experiment like this was done where uhm the medium of instruction was uh was in Filipino\n\n<$B>  \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$C>  \n\nAnd that was abandoned a few years later \n\n Uh obviously there there there 's a whole generation of kids who are running around very confused out there\n\n\nUh so there 's a unless you can evaluate it and quantify its its success then uhm it 's just going to be an experiment", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2aa38a6b-1fc9-467b-bd20-1668aa36eff7", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.117029+00:00"}

live uhm  \n\n<$A> \n\n  Saan kayo nakatira   \n\n\nNakatira ba kayo sa Cambridge mismo  \n\n<$B> \n\nNo but very near very near\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's like a ten to fifteen   minute drive  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah it 's one   of the suburbs of uh\n\n<$B> \n\nOne of the suburbs\n\n\nYes but I 'd rather not say\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay  o sige  \n\n<$B> \n\nBut I 'll tell you later  \n\n\nNo but it 's wonderful\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's a wonderful area\n\n\nIt 's quiet and it 's uh, I can drive there\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay  uh marunong ka nang mag-  drive\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\n Nagda-  drive  ka na roon  \n\n<$B> \n\n Opo pero  I wouldn't go to downtown\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah  talagang  \n\n<$B> \n\nThat would be like going to EDSA\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah they say Boston drivers are among the worst in the whole world\n\n<$B> \n\nWell they haven't been to Manila  \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay  pero papaano nagluluto ka na ba sa sa bahay n'yo  \n\n<$B> \n\nI 've always cooked\n\n\nI 've been a good cook  magmula ng  seven years old  ako pero ngayon  I know all these chores all these other for instance I realized that you know it had been years or\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIt was probably even the first time in my life that I got to open a can manually  \n\n\nBecause you know it 's not   because you don't want to but  \n\n<$A> \n\n  Marunong ka nang gumamit ng  can opener  ngayon    \n\n<$B> \n\n Marunong na kasi naman  you have everybody doing it for you here\n\n\nI mean all families all Filipino families have that\n\n<$A> \n\n Kumusta naman si  Kiko how is he doing with his studies\n\n<$B> \n\nHe 's doing very well\n\n\nThank you for asking but uhm of course Harvard is a very demanding school and\n\n<$A> \n\nYes uh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd his course is very demanding\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uhm they have to squeeze in all this uhm all this uhm education in one year\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nSo his knowledge bank is kind of getting stretched now\n\n<$A> \n\n   nakakasama ka na ba kasi  normally uh  lalo na  when students there are are married  'no  there are a lot of activities with the other students\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yeah it 's wonderful\n\n<$A> \n\nAre you  ano  are you already getting involved in the Harvard life\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm well yeah\n\n\nThey have this program for spouses always\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd we try to get together although because I don't live right in Cambridge\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm as the others do I don't get together with them as often as I I would want to\n\n\nBesides I 'm busy doing my own   things  back home\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nI don't know if you 've felt this already  kasi baka  maraming mga Filipino doon sa Cambridge na kilala ka  but are you enjoying the relative anonymity  na   naranasan mo   \n\n<$B> \n\n You know what I 'll tell you   one of the biggest one of the major reasons  na na-  in love  ako sa  Boston is that is it 's is that uh it is so different from California\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nIn the west you have more Filipinos\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nIn Boston Boston is not even as uh well New York of course is fast but it it also has a lot of Filipinos\n\n\nBoston is more quiet, \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThere are less Filipinos so for a celebrity like me who who appreciates some   peace  and quiet every once in a while it 's the   perfect place to be  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n Is this a welcome change   welcome change  \n\n<$B> \n\nYes absolutely absolutely\n\n<$A> \n\nHas this change already produced  ano may  baby  na ba  \n\n<$B> \n\nWe 're trying\n\n\nI 'm actually hoping it 's right now but\n\n<$A> \n\nReally uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I I 'm actually hoping but I we do believe it 's all going to be in God 's perfect time\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh so but but but it 's it 's really there you have all the time\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nTo relax and to\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen he 's not reading two hundred pages a day  you know when\n\n\nBut right now he 's having he 's going through his mid-terms   so  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   he 's in the the Kennedy School of Government\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah exactly\n\n<$A> \n\nAs opposed to the law school\n\n<$B> \n\nExactly   no not the law school  \n\n<$A> \n\n  Hindi siya pumasok sa    \n\n<$B> \n\nNo not the law school\n\n\nA lot of people think it 's the law school\n\n\nNo it 's the Kennedy School of Government\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n\nAlright well you know, we we 're talking about El Ni&ntilde;o earlier  ano  \n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\n At saka ewan ko kung   naranasan mo  'to  \n\n<$B> \n\n Oh it 's so bad in   Boston now it 's a yeah\n\n\n  It 's affecting us  too\n\n<$A> \n\n I understand   it 's  medyo malamig  in the in the area now\n\n<$B> \n\n Masyadong malamig   ngayon   \n\n<$A> \n\n Right   \n\n<$B> \n\nWe 're now in our thirties sometimes we go down to the twenties\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n\nBut I tell you from experience\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nUh the Boston winter\n\n<$B> \n\nIs worst than New York I hear\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so  handa ka na ba para sa  winter\n\n\n Uuwi ka aalisan mo na naman ang  Boston  \n\n<$B> \n\n Oo aalis ako  \n\n\nNo no but we 'll spend  siguro  Christmas here but there will actually be no work\n\n\n Pero  to us  kasi  it 's still a novelty  e  \n\n\nBecause it 's going to be our first winter\n\n\nSo okay it 's a welcome thing  'no  but I don't think I would be able to put up with it if I had to live there\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nFor years and years  'no  \n\n\nI don't think so\n\n<$A> \n\nWell you 'll be able to skate on the Charles River I mean uh\n\n<$B> \n\nNo my daughter will do that\n\n\nShe 's a skater\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's why because I heard  na si  K C is actually into skating\n\n<$B> \n\nShe is and she competes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd she has won something already\n\n<$B> \n\nYes and she even had a competition in Marlboro in Massachusetts\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nWith as part of the Philippine team that went\n\n<$A> \n\n  And I understand the Philippine team uh was skating well  \n\n<$B> \n\n A lot of Filipinos placed   \n\n\nYes they were very good\n\n\nI 'm so proud   yes  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nAnd so  si K C si  K C is also among the among these uh skaters\n\n<$B> \n\nYes she is\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh okay\n\n\nLet me ask you     mae-enganyo ka ba na baka  are you are you somehow thinking that you might want to live there for good\n\n<$B> \n\nI can't say it has not crossed my mind\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nNo actually it has crossed my mind about a million times  \n\n\nBut my husband is very nationalistic  \n\n<$A> \n\nWell\n\n<$B> \n\nHe 's probably you know he tells me that the reason that he 's there is to try to learn as much as he can to bring   back  to the Philippines\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nAnd also in a couple of years K C herself  baka maging  eligible  na 'yan  for Radcliffe\n\n<$B> \n\nOh she 's uh she 's kind of really  we  we actually sat down with her it 's funny that you   brought that up  \n\n<$A> \n\n Radcliffe    \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah we we really sat down with her and we said because I think it 's rubbing off on her this Harvard thing because she sees how important education is to her to her   Dad  and to me\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uhm she sees the kids in her school  'no  \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nI said she 's in grade seven now that 's middle school and uh she goes to private school near our house which is a lovely school that really brings out the best in every student\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nSo I tell her you better start this early if you wanna go to a good school a good college someday because \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n\nHow long are you gonna be there\n\n\nHow long is Kiko 's uh\n\n<$B> \n\nOh we have like about six seven months remaining\n\n\n  The program is for one year  \n\n<$A> \n\n That fast that fast uh the program is for one year   \n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's the same one that uh Secretary Alunan took\n\n\nLike I had a chance to meet him by the way and I have to tell you the newspapers and television does not do the man justice\n\n\nHe 's darn handsome in person  \n\n\n  Yeah  \n\n<$A> \n\n Okay   also after having rested  siguro  for several months\n\n<$B> \n\nAlso yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nHe looks more more relaxed\n\n\n Alam n'yo  in spite of your distance  medyo naabutan pa rin ng konting tsismis o konting   controversy\n\n\n Hindi ba  \n\n<$B> \n\n Meron oo  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh I understand that for example  lumabas dito daw si Gabby daw  your ex uh has been trying to to contact uh your daughter  'no  \n\n<$B> \n\nWell\n\n<$A> \n\n Nag-uusap na ba sila  \n\n<$B> \n\nIf you mean that he 's been trying to call\n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's absolutely not true\n\n\nIn the first place he does not know our number\n\n<$A> \n\n Okay\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd there 's not too many people know our number\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh if you 're saying if you 're asking if he has tried to have K C call him that is true\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm he 's told some mutual friends\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm and these mutual friends of ours have written K C saying you know your papa   wants  to speak to you \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\nBut it 's my daughter\n\n\nShe 's twelve years old and she\n\n<$A> \n\nHas she called   <unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n<$B> \n\n No   \n\n\nShe 's really not comfortable that 's what  she said it on \" Showbiz Lingo \"   I think  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   uh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I 'm not I 'm certainly not going to be the first person to stop her from getting in touch with her   father  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-hmmmh   \n\n<$B> \n\nBut I 'm also certainly not going to be the first   person  to force her to get in touch with him  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nAnd then interestingly in one of those strange coincidences in   life  \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$A> \n\nI understand Jenny Syquia and her new husband are also in the same area\n\n<$B> \n\nYes actually we  I might get in touch with\n\n\nI just got her number\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah   uh-huh  \n\n<$B> \n\n She   left her number with a   friend  of ours\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd that 's not so bad because you know the one thing that 's nice is that when Jenny and I got to talk which was just really once\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd about a long time ago on my  after my birthday   show  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\nWe agreed that our daughters should grow up knowing that they 're   sisters  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd that they should be loving each other\n\n<$A> \n\nI remember\n\n<$B> \n\nI appreciate that\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah I I I I had the honor also of being on that particular show where she came out and you had that encounter\n\n\nHave you kept up\n\n<$B> \n\nActually no\n\n<$A> \n\n Magkaibigan pa ba kayo  or\n\n<$B> \n\nWe have not kept in touch as in   calling  each other or visiting no no no\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh   \n\n<$B> \n\nIt was never like that because it was still I think for her it was still too fresh\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I had also just started a new life with my   new  husband\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nBut as far as you know she 's happy now Jenny\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I really have no idea\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nActually I only heard that she got married when I got back and I was so happy to hear that\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay   let 's take a break  \n\n<$B> \n\n She deserves to be happy I think   \n\n<$A> \n\nAlright we 'll be right back   \n\n\nOkay  mga  co-stars  mo sa  \n\n<$B> \n\nMy leading men   yes  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah yeah   \n\n\nHow was the film I mean uh   you did  this before you left\n\n<$B> \n\n You know   \n\n\nYes I   managed  to do   this  movie before I left in June\n\n<$A> \n\n Okay   \n\n\n  Oo    \n\n<$B> \n\nBut you know I have to tell you I always had in the back of my head of course that   since  it was a Joey Reyes project\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nHe wrote it\n\n\nHe directed it\n\n\nI said well Joey Reyes always makes good movies so this is gonna be a good movie   but , very very frankly I really really think it is so much better than I expected it to turn out\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd it 's uhm I 'm I 'm so thankful to to   Joey  \n\n<$A> \n\n  Pang-award   pang-award ba ito sa tingin mo    like the last time  \n\n<$B> \n\n That 's not for me   to say  but uh I always give my best anyway\n\n\nAnd Joey I think brought out the best in   each  of us\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$B> \n\nSo it 's it 's a great movie\n\n<$A> \n\n  Yeah  \n\n<$B> \n\n It 's solely   for women in   particular  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n<$B> \n\nBut the whole family will enjoy it\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's a great movie\n\n<$A> \n\nGoing back to Boston usually at this time of the year fall uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh

winter\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah yeah oh that 's   \n\n\nThat 's really nice   fall foliage  \n\n<$B> \n\n It is so   it was beautiful\n\n\n  If we had  you know\n\n<$A> \n\n Okay   \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd you know nowadays my husband and I we of course right now we can't anymore it 's too cold\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nBut in the summer we would go to this park and   barbecue  and\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah

{"text": "<$A> \n\n We hope we did not scare you when I said  ipapatawas namin kayo  \n\n\nBut today, uh we will show you the many other uses of  tawas  and uh from the market it is now available in every major department stores and supermarkets all over the country\n\n\nAnd of course today Dr Sonny Acha will talk to us about the many uses of  tawas  \n\n<$B> \n\nWell to start with uh,  tawas  as it  as we call it in the local medium Filipino is in English uh \" alum \" \n\n\nNow the chemical name, we have several   variations like  uh potassium aluminum sulfate uh which is this crystal group\n\n\nNow as far as the uses we can trace as far as history from the old folks that they 've been using it for simple treatment like uh for ailments like mouth sores or  singaw  \n\n\nSo from there you can see that it has the medicinal sort of medicinal uses which we have adopted into these cosmetic lines  \n\n<$A> \n\nI see and uh what is the ingredient in  tawas  \n\n\nFor example I know that you have gone into the deodorant line\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWhich is actually a more sophisticated way of just  pukpuk pukpuk  you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nYou pulverize it and people use it and it gets messy you know\n\n\nAnd now you 're using  tawas  with  calamansi  and  tawas  pure alum\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nNow uhm what 's the difference of uh the  tawas  with  calamansi  and pure alum\n\n<$B> \n\nNow with regards the differences in the deodorants we  we came out with two varieties now one with the pure  tawas  uh alum and one with the  calamansi  \n\n\nNow we added the  calamansi  extract\n\n\nThis is uh intended for people who perspire heavily especially the overweight\n\n\nSo we thought of just not using plain  tawas  but plus another additive which could help prevent heavy perspiration especially the odor emitted after perspiring\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n\nAnd uh I understand that these uh two uh products are now available in roll-on   and uh  \n\n<$B> \n\n And spray   \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd uh spray\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAlright\n\n\nNow uh how about the other uh lines that you are doing\n\n<$B> \n\nOne popular line right now that we have is the astringent group\n\n\nNow it comes in four different types\n\n\nWe have one for normal skin one for oily skin this is the  tawas  with uh pineapple extract and then one for skin discolorations like  an-an  \n\n\nWe added the radish extract\n\n\nAnd then lastly we have the  tawas  with avocado cucumber and  aloe vera  extract\n\n\nThis is uh intended for dry skin\n\n\nNow what makes our astringent different from the usual astringents that you see in the market is that we have instead of the usual boric acid uh content we added the  tawas  crystals\n\n\nSo this is pure and natural crystals without any chemical uh additives\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay I 'd like to go back you know one by one because sometimes uh we we see all these labels of products and you really don't know why this is so and why you should buy for example uh an astringent with pineapple\n\n\nNow tell us one by one exactly what is the importance of choosing one from from the other\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n\nSo let 's start with the  tawas  facial lotion with pineapple extract\n\n\nThat says here this is uh intended for oily skin \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause you have the pineapple which is uh which whose basic ingredient is vitamin C\n\n\nNow that helps dissolve the oils from the skin especially in the face\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo and then the next one is the  tawas  facial lotion with the radish extract\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThis is the first actually the first of its kind if not here in the country\n\n<$A> \n\n  But in the world yes  \n\n<$B> \n\n World yes   \n\n\nYes because we we were the first to put the radish extract\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nNow radish has the ingredient of sulfur and potassium which helps uh stabilize skin discolorations\n\n<$A> \n\n  I see  \n\n<$B> \n\n In short   if you have whitish spots it helps bring back the normal color of the skin\n\n<$A> \n\nUh you were mentioning uh a while ago about  an-an  you know\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd that 's something that normally you always hear people saying oh I have  an-an 'no  \n\n\nIn effect uh that 's not a skin disease that external skin disease it 's really uh\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's a vitamin   deficiency  \n\n<$A> \n\n Deficiency   \n\n<$B> \n\nOf the skin\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then the supplement you can get from the radish extract\n\n<$A> \n\nBut but don't we hear people say  na nakakahawa 'yang an-an  \n\n<$B> \n\nYes it 's a very common skin disease and it 's very readily communicable, \n\n\n  You  get in contact with people with this uh skin disease and you get it\n\n<$A> \n\n But   \n\n<$B> \n\nYou get the same skin problem\n\n<$A> \n\nEven if the other person is not uh who gets it and somebody else who has uh uh\n\n<$B> \n\n An-an  \n\n<$A> \n\nA low of potassium uh thing or just anybody gets it\n\n<$B> \n\nYou can have many causes one as I mentioned is vitamin deficiency plus it 's a communicable skin disease\n\n<$A> \n\nSo it 's a skin disease really\n\n<$B> \n\nNow if you have a potentially you you are already deficient in vitamins, involved with that problem you get it readily\n\n<$A> \n\nI see okay\n\n\nAnd radish when you eat radish it increases your potassium and your sulfur\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh okay\n\n\nNow you just mentioned about sulfur and uh and uh potassium\n\n\nLike for example we 're having Mount Pinatubo now erupting and people are talking about skin diseases and what can happen you know\n\n\nI mean is this uh uhm astringent uh going to be very helpful to people that suffer from this type of uh problem\n\n<$B> \n\nYes one potential danger if you have fall-outs from the volcanic eruption is you get a very irritating skin disease wherein you have  a freckle-like uh spots\n\n\nNow this is timely the radish extract uh facial lotion could help cure, this this said disease\n\n<$A> \n\nThis said disease\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay let 's go to the next one\n\n<$B> \n\nNow the next is the triple combination of uh avocado cucumber and  aloe vera  extract\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWhich we added with the  tawas  facial lotion\n\n\nNow this we intended for dry skin because uh especially  aloe vera  it 's a very popular herbal extract which is popularly known for moisturizing the skin\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nTogether with avocado and cucumber that helps uh even out even small freckles or wrinkles in skin\n\n<$A> \n\nIn the skin\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nEven freckles can be taken out\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nWow\n\n\nI 'm sure that will be uh very much uh appreciated by  especially the over forty  people  \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then lastly we have the uh  tawas  facial lotion which is uh for general use\n\n\nWe recommended this for all types of skin\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo for daily use maintenance in just cleaning the face the  tawas  facial lotion clear, which has no color\n\n<$A> \n\nI see \n\n\nNow you I know we 're discussing about  tawas  and you 're talking about astringents  'no  \n\n\nUh there is this uh uh notion that uh any kind of tea can also be very good you know for skin\n\n\nIs that is that something that uh is true\n\n<$B> \n\nYes as a matter of fact it 's an accepted practice in, in China and Japan and even Korea\n\n\nYou notice the skin of these people they 're very fair and very smooth\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd clear\n\n<$B> \n\nYes because it 's an ancient tradition in these countries to to take a bath using herbal teas\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nNow the extract from these uh the plants where we get the tea from, they have I think most of the vitamins needed for smoothing smoothening the wrinkles plus the moisturizing effect\n\n<$A> \n\nI know we 're talking about  tawas  but supposing we have you know for example in my yard I have  tanglad  you know the lemon tea grass or or this uh  tsaang gubat  you know\n\n\nIs that something that I can use too for for washing and bathing and uh using for shampoo\n\n\nIt can be good\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nIt could be a daily routine and it would be very good for the skin and hair\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd the hair too\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nI see what what is it for the hair that makes it good\n\n<$B> \n\nWell the tea because it 's a plant\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n'Cause one very common  uh ingredient in plants is that you have well you have chlorophyll\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThat is a  a normal plant protein and that is very good for the hair\n\n\nAnd then most of these some of them contains  saponin  like what we find in  gugu  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSome other plants also contain  saponin  with uh another variety\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n\nYou mentioned a while ago about uh you know this grass wild grass  'yong uh  \n\n<$B> \n\n Kugon  \n\n<$A> \n\n Cogon  \n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd you were saying that  cogon  also has uh is very good for shampoo\n\n<$B> \n\nYes especially the part of the  kugon  where you have uh before the roots\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nThat part\n\n\nThat 's very good for the hair\n\n\nIt helps the\n\n<$A> \n\nBut just uh about how many inches from the roots\n\n<$B> \n\nAbout two or three inches from the roots\n\n<$A> \n\nFrom the roots two or three inches\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nYou cut it and you boil it\n\n<$B> \n\nYou get the extract from that and then that 's very good for washing the hair\n\n\nIt helps moisturize also the hair follicles\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n\nHow do you get the extract\n\n\nYou boil it\n\n<$B> \n\nJust boil it\n\n<$A> \n\nOr you pound it and then\n\n<$B> \n\nYou can pound you can make a decoction or extraction   \n\n<$A> \n\nSonny you have such a vast knowledge about uh, you know natural things you know natural uses of uhm trees plants uh barks and all of that\n\n\nIf there 's some people or groups of people who are interested in getting themselves involved in this type of uh endeavor would you be able to help them\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nUh I will be more than willing to help them if they just come to me and I could give them advice on how to go on and how to start with the some little things which could go, grow big later on\n\n<$A> \n\nYes like for example you were saying  cogon  \n\n<$B> \n\nYes    kugon   \n\n<$A> \n\n You know somebody else   can do it you know\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd  tawas  is only one of the, vast  resources we have\n\n<$A> \n\nSo now uh tell me about the soap\n\n<$B> \n\nNow the soap\n\n\nOur  tawas  line we have three basically three different varieties, \n\n\nNow the first one is the plain  tawas  uh herbal soap which we we with the hypo-allergenic property which means it could be used even for babies\n\n\nNow this is highly recommended for pimples\n\n\nNow it takes about a week 's time and you have pimples drying up after using this\n\n\nAnd then the second variety is the  tawas  clear soap with  aloe vera  extract\n\n\nNow this as I 've mentioned before  aloe vera  is a moisturizing ingredient\n\n\nSo this is recommended for dry skin\n\n\nNow the third type is our plain uh  tawas  bleaching soap\n\n\nThis is not the transparent soap but opaque\n\n\nNow if you want the bleaching properties of  tawas  we recommend this one\n\n<$A> \n\nHow long before do you get uh to see the results by using this soap\n\n<$B> \n\nWell our studies show from about a month to about an average of three to one to three  time\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm and uh of course with the astringent goes with it also some body lotions  'no  \n\n<$B> \n\nYes uh we came out with two varieties of the hand and body lotion\n\n\nOne would be  tawas  with  aloe vera   extract again\n\n\nAs I 've mentioned this has an a moisturizing effect the  aloe vera  extract, and then the second kind is the hand and body lotion with uh carrot and papaya extract\n\n<$A> \n\nCarrot and papaya\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nNow this is highly recommended also for dry skin, especially those people with the in the upper age group we recommend the carrot and papaya extract\n\n\nNow our latest product is the \" Nature 's Touch  Tawas  Gentle Feminine Wash \" \n\n\nNow we came out with this uh basically for for the women group\n\n\nNow this is uh designed especially for during the heavy days menstrual period and then especially for pregnant women\n\n\nNow it it it has the antiseptic property of  tawas  of course the deodorant property and the bleaching property which you don't find in the usual uh feminine hygiene preparations in the market  \n\n<$A> \n\nSonny I understand this is the beginning of a whole pharmaceutical line\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh actually cosmetic line when we have completed the whole line probably later on we will expand in the pharmaceutical aspects of  tawas  because  tawas  itself has both cosmetic and pharmaceutical uses", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThe political capital he used to have also had eroded\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd the problem here is that uh uh the rate of erosion may start slow but then it could accelerate if nothing is done to uh to uh well uh attend to the basic concerns of the public and these concerns I identified earlier as being largely economic\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah and on the part of the President himself it serves as a wake-up call for him and his government\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I 'd like to think not on the part of the  of uh the President alone but on the part of the  people immediately around him\n\n<$B> \n\nImmediately around him\n\n<$A> \n\nThe cabinet members and to a great extent even those who would comprise his administration beyond his cabinet senators who have been working with him congressmen also may be said to  comprise his official family\n\n\nAnd to some extent in a very basic sense the general public will have to be interested too in how the President responds to the feelings of the people as for instance expressed in a survey like this\n\n<$B> \n\nOn top of the list of complaints by the people against the President is he 's insistent, \n\n\nSome describe it as his stubbornness to amend the Constitution, \n\n\nNow in your survey forty-two percent is against amending the Constitution at any time\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd we believe that it is one of the factors that brought him down\n\n<$A> \n\nWell uh we checked for that\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nBut it seems not to  swim  we looked into uh whether the people who uh who feel that the Constitution must not be amended at any time your forty-two percent  ,  or even a higher proportion fifty-seven percent who feel that Constitutional amendments at this point in time right now uh are not quite right \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$A> \n\nNow among these people we checked how many of them would still be uh approving of the President, and how many of them would express disapproval, we were quite surprised to find out that a majority  ,  even within this group who are of  ,  yes of the forty-two percent or of the fifty-seven percent are still expressing approval for the way he has run the presidency the administration the government\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n The forty-two percent   \n\n\nDespite his opposition to <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nWhat this means is that the Constitutional issue the issue of amending the Constitution is not really all that salient yet not all that important yet and we tested for that \n\n Out of sixteen issues socioeconomic and political and public safety issues uh people rated the issue of Constitutional amendments as number uh fourteen\n\n<$B> \n\nOf the concerns\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo  with number one being the most important therefore this is something that to them is not all that salient, \n\n\nThat is why even when they disagree with the President on this matter since it is not all that salient yet from their point of view then this President 's capital is not eroded all that much\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh uh-huh the most the most urgent personal concern as listed on table eight of the survey uh is to avoid being sick and to stay healthy\n\n\nThe September two to sixteen survey indicated fifty-four percent considers this\n\n<$A> \n\nThe number one priority\n\n<$B> \n\nNow, yes, what does this say\n\n<$A> \n\nThis is a very this is a very understandable thing, \n\n\nWhen you are speaking of a people who are largely poor, and people who are threatened by by unemployment, and when they are employed they have low wages, then to them the  basic concern the most basic concern is that one should not get sick\n\n\nBut uh that is for most of the public or poor\n\n\nWhat is interesting is also that among those who are better off this is also a major concern, \n\n\nAnd when we looked into that we realized that uh even among those who are better off uhm when they do get sick they require medical attention that uh could cost them quite a bit and therefore   there  \n\n<$B> \n\n <unclear> words </unclear>   \n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's right, \n\n\nOkay, therefore there is really a universal concern about uh about one getting getting sick\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh uh-huh if we look at table nine \" the most urgent national concerns \" on top of the list is the low pay of workers which represents fifty-eight percent on the September two to sixteen survey\n\n\nIn the last survey of May twenty-one and June seven it was sixty-one percent\n\n\nWhy did it go down\n\n<$A> \n\nIt did not \n\n\nActually those proportions the fifty-eight percent and the sixty-one percent would be roughly the same\n\n<$B> \n\nUh oh yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nRoughly the same\n\n<$B> \n\n Extrapolation  \n\n<$A> \n\nYes  oo  \n\n<$B> \n\nThe second is high prices of people 's basic necessities\n\n\nAnd then the  the poor people the the recovery of the economy\n\n\nWell the Constitutional change is way down below with only eight percent, for this particular survey\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it 's not the issue of the day  \n\n<$A> \n\nYes I think that is why when people put uh quite a bit of uh importance on the Constitution this is something that we personally may believe in that the Constitution is always important, \n\n\nBut uh given you know the priorities of what may be considered more urgent than just urgent among a series of concerns that are all urgent, then the Constitutional issue is less urgent, the low pay is the highest concern\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm, the rising prices of commodities, the low pay, uh the peace and order situation are tops on our concerns\n\n<$A> \n\nIn that order yes\n\n<$B> \n\nIn that order\n\n Now Professor, let me first take on this comment on line from Malabon Mr Archie Santiago\n\n\n Dapat huwag unahin ni Presidente sina Lucio Tan Danding Cojuangco at Imelda Marcos ginagamit niya ang mahirap para sa kaibigan niyang mayaman  \n\n\nDid the cronyism issue came out uh come out on this survey\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh meron tayong  issue  riyan ng uh ng ano yung  coddling\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah \" coddling \" at seventy-eight percent coddling of well known people who dominated and gained much during the Marcos era\n\n<$A> \n\nWe even have also graft and corruption \n\n Graft and corruption would be fairly well addressed about half of the public would say that this is a major concern it is an urgent concern for the public to address for the government to address\n\n<$B> \n\nThe flip-flopping on the politics of government\n\n\nDid that have a a toll on on the popularity of the President for example his change of of the death penalty decisions from life to death uh the commutation of sentences and all\n\n<$A> \n\nIn this survey uhm these specific very specific issues had not been tested for but uh I I think I can say with some degree of uhm confidence that uh when all of these issues are put together, then in the public mind they register some idea of uh perhaps indecisiveness, \n\n\nAlso the idea that uh there is not quite that needed constancy or consistency, in decision-making and therefore you do find some some people, basically those who are better off who would still be supportive of the President let 's say, last June, by a majority of uh what sixty-two sixty-four percent, this level would still be majority but it is now at fifty-two, \n\n\nNow these are the people who would demand much more consistency and much more clarity much more transparency of the administration\n\n\nThe bulk of our people however, are not all that  ano  are not all that driven, as it were to worry about Constitutional issues about transparency about uh freedom of the press, \n\n\nThey are really overwhelmed by the day to day demands of uh continuing to live to the point where you speak of urgent personal concerns not national\n\n<$B> \n\nNot national  oo  \n\n<$A> \n\nPersonal concerns, then you 'll find out that the third best uh the third uh best rated that is to say the greatest number of people, would say that their urgent personal concern has to do with simply being able to eat   enough  \n\n<$B> \n\n Self-preservation   \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah, being able to eat enough every day, and nothing else can be more basic than that, \n\n\nWhen you are confronted by that problem, then all the other problems become really secondary\n\n<$B> \n\nProfessor I don't know if we can call Malaca&ntilde;ang 's reaction to this survey as expected or  pro forma  because it has issued a statement saying that the survey rating of thirteen percent decline in the popularity of the President was attributed to the decisions the President made to keep the Republic afloat\n\n\nLet 's say the decisions on the oil prices the decisions on on labor, the the call for higher wages these are hard decisions as Malaca&ntilde;ang would put it but it has to be made by the President and those are the decisions that pulled him down\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yes I think\n\n<$B> \n\nIs that a correct interpretation or reaction to the survey\n\n<$A> \n\nI think some, of the uh some of the depreciation, the decreases, in uh the approval rating of the President may be also attributed to decisions that he made which would not be popular decisions, \n\n\nFor instance last year you might remember that uh that uh the President uh uh had a statement to the effect that uh there was not going to be salary increases, \n\n\nAnd then uh the President also had some statements to make regarding Constitutional amendments or provisions of the Constitution that would have to be changed\n\n\nThere were also quite a few other statements with did not sit which did not sit well at least with some, sectors of our of our uh public, \n\n\nNow every time part of the public gets to be disaffected with some statements that the President makes then that costs him, but his uh his core his support is holding and so it is not as if he had become unpopular on account of those decisions which had hit some sectors\n\n\nI think uh the danger that uh may be uh may be discerned in the combination of figures and analysis that could be brought to bear on these figures, is that uh what the President has now is a core that might erode so much faster, and when that happens that will really be a terrible thing\n\n<$B> \n\nTeresita Reyes on-line from Laguna, what are the bases of the survey to make it accurate and credible, reliable \n\n And somebody here is asking about the the percentage of sampling errors and the response errors\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay so, \n\n\nWell actually we supplied that  'no  \n\n Uh to guard against to guard against uh inaccurate surveys the testing that is uh uh done and which might be the easiest thing to do is to construct a technically uh legitimate variable or acceptable from the point of view of academic methodology sample, \n\n\nTo ensure that you have a representative sample so that when you gather the responses you can actually tick off the entire you know adult population eighteen years old and over so that those inferences could be made, \n\n\n At  there is another thing and that is even more important that is questionnaire design, how you design the questions, \n\n\nNow what we do is we put together questions that uh we pretest for clarity and also which we make certain would flow logically in a face-to-face interview\n\n\nThese things are taken care of\n\n\nIt 's not the kind of survey where uh you know you uh you put up a question which has not been pre-tested, for clarity or for  or for logic, and then you ask people to register themselves either via a questionnaire or uh via a telephone and you don't check really on how the selection of these people is uh is uh uh done\n\n\nNow, historically, surveys in the last uh fifty years have uh have become more and more reliable in terms of reading public opinion as well as uh electoral preferences \n\n This is not to say that uh that uh the surveys cannot be wrong, \n\n\nThere had been some cases when they have been terribly terribly wrong, but when they had been wrong, it was possible to find out why they had gone wrong and where they had gone wrong\n\n<$B> \n\nIf if I may Professor   I 'd like  \n\n<$A> \n\n Now may may I   just add as regards that last thing  'no  the sampling, errors, \n\n \n\n<$B> \n\n One thousand two hundred   \n\n\n Minus three uh-huh, uh-huh   \n\n<$A> \n\nThat means to say that the figures  within the frame   ha  you come across a forty percent figure then you can read it as forty-three or as thirty-seven or fifty-three as uh if it is fifty it can it could be forty-seven", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

On-Line \" Mr Treasurer\n\n<$B> \n\nGood evening Gene\n\n<$A> \n\nUh let 's put a historical perspective into this discussion about power and the power sector in the country\n\n\nLooking back ten years ago in the nineteen nineties we had this crippling power crisis \n\n Now what do you think caused that that problem\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh we as we all know right now uh the the power crisis was was primarily caused by by two major factors\n\n<$A> \n\n  Uh uhm  \n\n<$B> \n\n One is   a is is is uh misforecasting   the  inability to be able to plan properly for the requirements of a a an economy that 's taking off\n\n<$A> \n\n Okay   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd second is the inability to attract the right kind of investments uh to ensure that uh you would have players coming in to to provide uh generating uh projects\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n\nNow the inability to attract investors what brought this when in when in the nineteen nineties the Philippines was one of those highly regarded by the foreign investment uh portfolios as one of the best in Asia to put your money\n\n\nBut at that time why were we not able to attract the foreign investors in the power sector\n\n<$B> \n\nWell I I I think it 's uh primarily because of uh the the structural reforms needed to uh to provide uh a a a transparent playing field for all investors  ,  uh in the country has not really seen it its its fruition yet \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIt was started early in the Aquino administration but uh it has to take some time to be able to to get uh investors uh confident uh with uh with the environment in the Philippines\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\nWe all know that the economy suffered in that in that period but how do you assess the performance of the economy then\n\n\nWas it way below because of the power crisis or did this power crisis uh uh stunt our growth to the present\n\n<$B> \n\nUh well definitely at that time as you you you could remember most of our ASEAN peers were already uh uh have already taken off\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh we were still  uh being saddled with a very basic infrastructure problem which is uh supply of electricity\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm   uh uhm  \n\n<$B> \n\n And that   is very keen critical as far as ensuring uh investments to come in and businesses to flourish\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh it it uh and and and in in in that context that 's why I guess uh we were pretty much late in   in  in seeing some economic development uh vis-&agrave;-vis our Asian peers\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nWould you say that the condition of the oil prices the the the rate of of uh crude in the world market at that time in the nineteen nineties contributed to this power crisis uh the the spiraling cost of electricity at that time\n\n<$B> \n\nWell actually I I I I don't think we saw significant amounts of uh rate uh increases   uh in the early nineties  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm uh uhm uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nIt was really more a basic problem of supply\n\n<$A> \n\nInfrastructure\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's   correct  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   uh-huh and maybe policies also of the government\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah well you have to allow uh uh some gestation period and maturity for   certain  certain initiatives by the government  ,  to be able to sink in to the uh investing public \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm now comes this warning of the Washington Sycip Policy Center saying that in the year two thousand four we may or we might again suffer another debilitating power crisis similar to that of the nineteen nineties\n\n\nWhy is this so\n\n\nBecause they they added that uh power demand will exceed by the year two thousand four because of population, increase in in industry in industries and all those things but is it forthcoming\n\n<$B> \n\nWell the likelihood is is uh is is uh very clear   if we  do not get additional investments   or investors  to come in to build up new power plants\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm uh uhm   \n\n\n Okay   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh the current situation in the industry is such that uh there is uh currently some some level of overcapacity  ,  in terms of power supply \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay  uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd that overcapacity was brought about by uh uh our our our want or need to be able to ensure that that uh supply would be in place hopefully to address uh agri-growing economy\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm uh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut uh we had seen the  uh uh the Asian crisis uh   couple  of years ago   and that stunted  our growth\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Okay   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nNow we 're not seeing the demand uh coming in   to take  in the supply \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh you would have to be able to ensure that there would be certain structural reforms in the industry  ,  uh to allow a more transparent level playing field under which  ,  uh investors could put at risk their capital and hopefully gain some uh gain some profits uh and returns uh from those investments \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nThe government and the proponents of this proposed uh power bill restructuring the country 's power sector pin so much hope on this proposal that could revolutionize or well liberalize our power sector\n\n\nBut Juan de la Cruz the man on the street doesn't see along that line because they feel that whatever you do in the power sector power rates will always remain high\n\n\nAs it is we are known to be the second highest in Asia next only to Japan in terms of power rates when when in fact Japan is a such a highly industrialized country and the Philippines is not but we have the second highest rate in the entire of Asia\n\n\nWhy is that so\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh as far as uh cost of uh power  'no  it it primarily the biggest component of uh the  bill  ,  Is uh practically made up of the uh the generation charge    'no   \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh at this point in time the the major supplier of  of of power is is is National Power Corporation\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nNow because of certain uh policies uh that uh that used to be implemented with respect to cost subsidies as well as uh uh providing certain services in unviable areas  ,  and then together with the need to be able to fast-track uh the addition of new capacities to solve the the uh power crisis in the early nineteen   nineties  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n the NAPOCOR cost structure uh had had ballooned to a certain extent  ,    wherein  now you have the cost of uh power in the Philippines generation  ,  at the generation level  ,  much higher than the retail rates  ,  of five or six Asian countries \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm  uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nSo that makes uh the Philippines uncompetitive as far as uh electricity rates are concerned\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh there is a lot of hope that 's being pinned on on the omnibus power bill  ,  because it hopes to be able to institute certain reforms and restructuring in that industry \n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that you could enable a more transparent uh and market driven pricing  ,  for your cost of electricity \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nAs I 've mentioned uh NAPOCOR currently is the major supplier \n seeks to privatize break up and privatize uh NAPOCOR 's generating assets into several competing companies\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nTogether with the possible uh other uh independent power producers that   would  compete with those uh with those uh generating companies of NAPOCOR uh should allow market forces to bring down the rates\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm allow me Mr Andrada to say again or take the point of view of Juan de la Cruz in the in the aspect of in the matter of the oil deregulation law uh which the proponents sold or the selling point they used to to pursue this oil deregulation law was that market forces will determine prices of fuel and fuel price could be more accessible to the public because of market forces\n\n\nNow again in this proposed power bill restructuring the country 's power sector the selling point is again being used is that prices would be more reasonable because of the play of market forces but for Juan de la Cruz it isn't so\n\n\nWhy can't we not have that kind of philosophy or or perspective from Juan de la Cruz who feels he is already a victim of that strategy used in the deliberations of the oil price  uh oil  industry deregulation law\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm well uh one is that uh there would be as contained in the omnibus bill   uh  draft of the   lower house  there would be a mandated five percent reduction in uh in uh cost of generation which will get back on to the consumers \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh this is a definite this is a definite five percent reduction\n\n\nIt 's it 's not cosmetics\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThe consumers will see a five percent reduction in their bill\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nNow the second aspect is that you have a more global open uh situation under which uh under which uh power generation companies  ,  compete \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh no longer is it uh relegated to a regional basis but it 's on a global basis\n\n\nYou have U S utilities or even uh European utilities uh having very strong presence in Asia   because  they believe there is significant amount of potential\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut they compete amongst each other and uh I think the beauty of this is that anyone and everyone who has the the ability to to uh to to think of of investing  ,  and providing the capital could actually compete in the power sector\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n\nBut why is it so hard for the power sector to convince the public that a deregulated a restructured power industry sector could lower power rates in the end\n\n<$B> \n\nWell maybe I think it 's uh because the public has never seen uh such   occur in the Philippines  yet  'no  and even   in Asia   'no  uh but\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut if you look at uh global trends countries that have deregulated there are countries that have deregulated uh as early as about nine or ten years ago   and some  only as recent as about two or three years ago   uh  the end result has always been uh substantial real savings for the consumers \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm  uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIn fact uh some countries now uh their consumers are saying I have so much electricity at a cheap price I don't know what to do with it \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh uh-huh uh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo we hope that kind of a trend would actually translate and transpose itself in the Philippines when when uh the industry gets deregulated on the generating side\n\n<$A> \n\nCurrently MERALCO has almost one and a half million subscribers in its franchise areas in the in the cities and provinces that we have mentioned Laguna Quezon Batangas nineteen towns in Pampanga Metro Manila Bulacan Rizal and Cavite\n\n<$B> \n\nWell\n\n<$A> \n\nUh\n\n<$B> \n\nThree and a half\n\n<$A> \n\n  Three and a half  \n\n<$B> \n\n Three and a half million   consumers \n\n<$A> \n\nThree and a half uh-huh\n\n\nYeah three and a half million consumers right\n\n\nNow in the next five years the economy is expected to grow to grow by an average of five point eight percent\n\n\nHow much would this kind of factors affect the viability of MERALCO in the next five years\n\n\nUh what kind of pressure would this put on MERALCO operations in terms of rates in terms of its expansion projects its distribution  ,  and maintenance \n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nWell uh MERALCO would have even without looking at an expanded market\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh MERALCO normally has to spend approximately three billion pesos a year  ,  in capital expenditure programs  ,  just to maintain the system \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause uh well the normal wear and tear it 's an outside uh plant\n\n\nIt 's an outside system exposed to the elements   there  is normal wear and tear\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nUh-huh uh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd that means constant replacements and upgrades\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh besides uh most of our a significant component of our transformers and circuit breakers are already over

us today\n\n<$B> \n\nUh good morning Karmina\n\n\nGood morning Dan\n\n<$C> \n\nGood morning   Sir  \n\n<$A> \n\n Okay   government has already sent uh two envoys to the Netherlands\n\n\nThat 's uh Agrarian Reform Secretary Hernani Braganza and former Justice Secretary Silvestre Bello to talk with founding C P P A Chairman Jose Maria Sison\n\n\nDo we have any news from the two envoys\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh you know actually the trip of uh Chairman uh of the panel Atty Silvestre Bello  ,  uh was done uh after a uh I understand a conversation over the phone with Joma Sison immediately after Joma Sison in the Netherlands found out that the uh Atty Silvestre Bello had been designated officially \n\n<$C> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nHe was asked that maybe you can come over so that we can talk of how to get started <unclear> 1 word </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nSo you see that as an indication that uh things might just go well because uh Jose Maria Sison liked the appointment of Secretary Bello as the head of the panel\n\n<$B> \n\nIndeed Karmina\n\n\nAs a matter of fact yesterday we got a copy of the uh official press statement made by Joma Sison  ,  in the Netherlands among others reiterating his congratulations uh to President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo for having adopted this <unclear> 2 words </unclear> policy of uh constructive peace process  ,  against the war policy of the past administration\n\n\nAnd he he specifically mentioned in his press statement that he welcomed the designation of Atty   Silvestre  Bello and for that matter including Secretary Nani Braganza because uh they uh he knows that these people have correct credentials and uh correct competence to be able to deal with the issues at hand\n\n<$A> \n\n Right   \n\n<$C> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nOkay so with these positive developments that are happening now as far as uh moving back to the uh negotiating table uh when are we going to see uh these gentlemen sit down again and talk peace\n\n\nThere are uh reports coming out that Joe Maria Sison is actually waiting first for the number of political prisoners that would be released\n\n\nIs this going to be an all or nothing thing\n\n\nOr maybe say half and then we 'll talk \n\n\nWhat is the situation in this area\n\n<$B> \n\nLet 's just say uh Dan that uh the matter of uh the issue of the release of the so-called political prisoners  ,  uh are activities that will <unclear> 3 words </unclear> of the panel in the effort to restart or resume the uh talks \n\n<$C> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIn the next few days hopefully within a day or two we hope to be able to get news from uh Secretary former Secretary Bello because I understand he 's coming back he 's not staying very long\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThe important thing is he should be able to set the tone of the uh agenda and set the uh timetable\n\n\nAnd find out from the N D F when the group of Fr Jalandoni who was designated Chair of the N D F negotiators will be coming to the Philippines to be able to start the talks here in the Philippines\n\n<$C> \n\nSo we will really be uh looking forward to this   uh  report when he comes back\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\n  Yes  uh we are confident that uh we 'll be getting a positive uh report from uh Bebot Bello\n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\nOkay so Secretary we are not looking at a quota here as far as the the political prisoners to be released are concerned\n\n<$B> \n\nNot necessarily\n\n\nUh they claim that there are more than two hundred\n\n\nBut since the time of former President Ramos there have been uh so-called or alleged political offenders who have been released\n\n\nNow uh as I said the administration of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo did what it 's doing not because it is the demand of the other side but because uh we feel that by doing so we 'll be able to uh prepare the ground uh conducive to the resumption of talks\n\n<$A> \n\nEarly into her administration the President uh stressed that she would like for Jose Maria Sison to come home\n\n\nIs this part of the exploratory talks now going on between former Secretary Bello and Secretary Braganza\n\n<$B> \n\nUh yes\n\n\nIt 's very possible\n\n\nAs a matter of fact even about a week or so ago I already mentioned that uh should the Chairman uh choose to come home he is welcome\n\n\nAs a matter of fact we are going to do our part by uh implementing the so-called \" Joint Agreement on Safety and uh Immunity Guarantees \" JASIG which had been agreed upon before \n\n So with the current atmosphere I am very confident that uh the leadership of the N D F will consider coming home so that we could talk about the problems besetting our people here in our country\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\nSir in another uh front as far as negotiations are concerned it seems that now with the C P P N P A there 's uh again the the light at the end of the tunnel is getting bigger and bigger for all of us\n\n\nUh what is now happening on the other side of the fence here in the Philippines with the M I L F\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh we also have very positive signs   uh  Dan\n\n<$C> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nUh about a week ago we received a letter coming from uh Atty  Jilalan  Ali one of the uh negotiators of the M I L F  ,  who mentioned that uh Chairman Hashim Salamat of the  Moro  Islamic Liberation Front also welcomed the uh uh new policy adopted by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo \n\n<$C> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd the M I L F leadership also welcomed the moves such as the suspension of defensive military operations against the M I L F, the move right now of the President of having created an inter-agency committee for Mindanao that will attend to the relief and rehabilitation of work especially on the return of evacuees to their uh places of uh   original  uh residence\n\n<$C> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$A> \n\nRight\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd at the same time welcomed the move that uh you read in the papers that the uh government had already withdrawn even the warrant of arrest that was issued before by uh by the former Chief P N P on uh Chairman Salamat Muhrad Jafar and other members or leadership of the M I L F  ,  in connection with the uh coming chief P N P \n\n<$C> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nThat 's right\n\n<$B> \n\nSo uh these are all uh very nice uh confidence-building measures\n\n<$C> \n\n  Uh uhm  \n\n<$B> \n\n That   we hope would be responded to by the M I L F by announcing   the  membership of their panel that will talk to the government panel\n\n<$C> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nNow uhm in a recent interview that we had with Atty Ed Kabalu the spokesperson of uh the M I L F they he was saying that uh to that date when we were talking to him there was still no uh black and white uh information coming from the G R P or the government regarding these uh conditions to set uh the meeting once again\n\n\nUh have we already forwarded uh something in black and white\n\n<$B> \n\nYes we did uh\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYou recall about a week ago  ,  I mentioned the letter of uh from Atty  Jilalan  Ali uh that was in response to the letter  ,  in black and white sent by uh Chairman Jess Dureza   Chair  of our panel dated February fifteen \n\n\nApparently uh their so-called spokesman Ed Kabalu didn't know this but there was already an invitation sent by uh Jess Dureza\n\n\nSo we are uh we know that uh they already know the official position taken by government to be able to resume the talks\n\n<$C> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n I see   \n\n\n Okay   \n\n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nI think it was in the same conversation that we had with spokesperson Kabalu that he said that he was kind of disappointed because of what the President said about that particular issue of the return of territory to the M I L F\n\n\nHe said that uhm once we go uh and meet again on the negotiating table that there should be no pre-conditions set \n\n\nAnd then uh the President came out on national T V and said that uh she is sad to say uh she is saddened by the fact that there will be no return of territory to the M I L F\n\n\nHas that particular stand been compromised already\n\n<$B> \n\nWell it 's possible that that was the decision or statement taken by uh Mr Ed Kabalu at that time\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut as I said the last letter uh the much later uh communication we got from the other camp was that they welcomed the <unclear> words </unclear> of President Macapagal-Arroyo especially when the suspension of the military operations was announced and that uh hand in hand with the negotiation is the rehabilitation and development effort \n\n including the agenda items as well as the timetable that they should follow to be able to move forward in this process\n\n<$C>  Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay  you mentioned uh the word \" timetable \" there\n\n\nUhm do you do are we following anything as far as  breakthroughs uhm are concerned\n\n\nBecause we very well know that the May elections is coming up and this might just be one of the campaign issues uhm in the on the campaign trail\n\n<$B> \n\nWell you know Karmina uh our Chairman Jess Dureza is in Mindanao and uh as a matter of fact is in constant contact with the other side\n\n\nAnd that 's why I said that uh if the other side M I L F had to form or could form their panel then uh on the ground that they 'll be able to discuss exactly when they should start but the timetable for <unclear> words </unclear> has started because of all these initiatives taken unilaterally by the government\n\n\nAnd I hope that the other side will respond accordingly\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay Sir I just want to clarify if in the letter of Atty  Jilalan  Ali did they still uh mention the fact that they would want the negotiations to happen outside the country\n\n<$B> \n\nUh there was no such mention\n\n<$C> \n\n  Uh uhm  \n\n<$B> \n\n But you   know Dan uh I think that was what they were saying before\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut the question I 'm gonna ask is, supposing uh that is under consideration what country do you think or has there been any country uh member of the O I C that has volunteered to say yes  ,  we are welcome to uh such a suggestion\n\n\nUh unlike in our negotiations with the talks with the M N L F in the nineteen   ninety-four  to nineteen ninety-six you will recall that the M N L F being a <unclear> word </unclear> observer status in the O I C  ,  uh was handled in such a way that uh a committee of six headed by uh Indonesia became the uh Chair  ,  of the negotiations the talks of which were held in Jakarta\n\n<$C> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n That 's right   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd that was a voluntary act on the part of Indonesia to uh allow themselves be the venue and play the host  \n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm that 's   right  \n\n<$B> \n\n So   the question we have to ask will be number one I think the M I L F is not uh officially recognized by the O I C like the recognition of Islamic   M N L F  \n\n<$C> \n\n M N L   F\n\n<$B> \n\nThey are looked upon as one entity\n\n\nNumber two there is no volunteer uh on the part of the other members of the O I C member countries composed of seven this time which includes Brunei\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\nTo present themselves as the venue\n\n<$B> \n\nTo present themselves as the venue\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo I think it 's just something that the  M I L F at that time was hoping would happen\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut uh we must still understand that our neighboring countries have their own problems\n\n<$C> \n\nUh uhm that 's right \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd we are not sure whether they are just about ready to extend an invitation\n\n\nIt 's just like you and I 're talking and suddenly we would we would like to uh uh thresh out our problems and we say let 's go to the house of Karmina  ,  when she has not extended us an invitation \n\n<$C> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd she may not even serve us breakfast\n\n<$A> \n\nHuh  \n\n\nOkay Secretary yes or no on this particular question\n\n\nAre you going to allow the talks between uh the G R P and the N D F this time to be held at another country\n\n<$B> \n\nWell again actually that 's something that uh we hope uh Atty Bello will be able to thresh out during his personal conversation\n\n\nProbably that thing would have happened already yesterday\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh I 'm sure when Atty Bello returns he will tell us what will be how the disposition of the N D F might be on this particular matter\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay and when are the two envoys expected to come home\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh I was told that uh they 're supposed to be there only about three days\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7abb63ae-864e-4335-a454-4fe4f1325678", "added":

Speaker\n\n\nUh Mr Speaker, uh I 'm in support of this Bill but uh on uh a\nqualified basis Mr Speaker, \n\n\nI 'm also a member of the uh Ways and Means Committee\n\n\nNow my question is uh Your Honor, uh will this uh increased rate\nbe a permanent fixture in our national Internal Revenue Code\n\n<$D> \n\nDoes the gentleman refer to the the proposed increase in the\nexcise tax on all the items enumerated in the Bill\n\n<$C> \n\nUh yes Your Honor\n\n<$D> \n\nYes, Your Honor   there is  no proviso here that\nstates otherwise, \n\n<$C> \n\n Uh   in other words Your Honor uh this uh\nincreased rate will forever be in the Internal Revenue Code, \n\n\nMr Speaker uh, this Bill uh represents what I think is uh, a\nuh, measure imposing uh, the so-called \" sin taxes \" \n, \n\n\nThis is true because, sloth Mr Speaker, is one of the\ncardinal sins, \n\n\nSloth in ordinary parlance is laziness\n\n\nThis Bill represents the lazy government that we have Mr Speaker\nbecause uh these taxes on sin products Mr Speaker are the easiest source of\nrevenue for government\n\n\nEvery time the government suffers a deficit every time it needs\nmoney, it looks at these products petroleum products, beer, liquor\nand cigarettes, as the source of revenue since, the taxes are\ncollected at the place of production, \n\n\nSo when government needs immediate cash they resort to these\nso-called taxes on sin products, \n\n\nWe cannot forever allow this government, to keep on imposing\ntaxes, at the same time the government does not do anything about\ninefficiency in the collection of taxes in looking for ways and means, of\nfinding other sources of revenue to defray the cost of government Mr Speaker\n\n\nSo Your Honor we plead you to be agreeable, to put a sunset\nclause on this Bill that it only be imposed for two years, \n\n<$D> \n\nUh Your Honor uh this is not yet the appropriate time to\nconsider uh the amendments and therefore during the period of amendments the\nsubject could very well be discussed\n\n\nBut I would want to point out uh Your Honor that uh, there had\nbeen occasions also in the past when taxes on these items were reduced by the\ngovernment and in fact, it was reduced pursuant to uh Executive Order\nnumber nine four seven and further reduced later pursuant to P D nineteen\nsixty-nine\n\n\nSo the point Your Honor is while the law that is being amended\nseems to be permanent in nature Your Honor because there is no sunset clause\nit is however a fact that from time to time the government amends, \nwhenever there is no further need for this\n\n\nAnd in fact the government has indeed amended by reducing the taxes\nin the past, \n\n<$C> \n\nUh Mr Speaker uh this uh, probably in the history of the\nnational Internal Revenue Code, the taxes on so-called sin products have\nbeen the most dynamic, \n\n\nYear in and year out they have been increased simply because the\ngovernment is lazy to improve, its  collection system, and\nto look for ways, of uh looking for alternative sources of revenue and to\ncut, the burgeoning uh bureaucracy, \n\n\nMy point uh Your Honor is, let 's deliver a message to the\ngovernment, that at least it must put its house in order at least in\nterms of raising revenues\n\n\nThey cannot forever come to us in this chamber and impose taxes\nwhich heat which, hit both the both the poor and the rich, \n\n\nThese are the taxes which cut across all sectors of society because\nthese are the taxes which are shifted to the consumers, \n\n\nWhen you buy beer the company does not pay the tax it 's the beer\ndrinker who pays the tax, \n\n\nWhen uh, you smoke a cigarette it is not the government which\npay the tax because it is not the company which pays the tax it is the small\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> who pay the tax\n\n\nAnd usually it is the poor people, who want to drink for example\nuh rum or, smoke uhm locally manufactured cigarettes cheap local\ncigarettes who are hit by this kind of taxes, \n\n\nSo let 's teach at least this government a lesson, to improve\nits taxes collection system\n\n\nAnd as the Speaker said, let 's cut, or trim down the budget\nof the government by uh removing uh the excess fat, \n\n\nThat 's one way of uh keeping the government, within its means\n, instead of raising taxes which impose a heavy burden on our people, \n\n\nSo Mr Speaker, if the uh the uh sponsor of uh or uhm uh our\nHonorable Chairman would agree, just to deliver a message to the\ngovernment why don't we just put a limit a timeframe for these increased\ntaxes\n\n\nBy nineteen ninety-two, these increased taxes should be, \nshould have a sunset clause\n\n\nAfter nineteen ninety-two then we go back to the reduced the\nexisting rates\n\n<$D> \n\nUh Mr Speaker the Committee on Ways and Means of which the\ngentleman is a member has been doing its best to compel the government to\nimprove its collection, \n\n\nAnd the fact remains Mr Speaker that during the deliberation of\nthis Bill the gentleman never spoke against it, \n\n\nSo it came as a surprise for a Vice-Chairman of the Committee on\nWays and Means would now be talking about all those things when he kept quiet\nall this time during the deliberation by the Committee\n\n\nMr Speaker I want to point out that under the rule, a member who\nvoted in favor of a measure has no business talking about or against that\ncertain measure\n\n<$C> \n\nMr Speaker what I 'm trying to deliver was is to deliver a\nmessage to the government that we cannot keep on uhm imposing taxes\n\n\nWhat I 'm suggesting is let 's deliver a message by putting a\ntimeframe to the effectivity of these increased taxes\n\n<$D> \n\nNo   Your Honor  I will not accept that\n\n<$C> \n\n This is uh   \n\n<$D> \n\n  This is not  the period of amendment Mr Speaker\n, \n\n<$C> \n\n Just giving the   \n\n<$B> \n\nWith the permission of the gentlemen on the floor the session\nis suspended,  \n\n\nSession is resumed, \n\n<$C> \n\nMr Speaker, uh pursuant to Section twenty-nine of uh the\nHouse Rules I have filed my written objection to this Bill with the Secretary\n, \n\n\nSo it cannot be said, that uh as a member of this of the\nCommittee on Ways and Means I did not uh stand up and interpellate\n\n\nAnd Mr Speaker it 's not true that I 'm here to grandstand, \n\n\nWhat I 'm here is to deliver to the government that we cannot go on\nrelying on taxes, \n\n\nUh the government should also impose uh, put its house in order\n\n\nThat 's all Mr Speaker, \n\n<$D> \n\nUh Mr Speaker, as Chairman of the Committee I 'm not aware\nof the written objection cited by the gentleman\n\n\nBut the fact remains, that he participated actively in drafting\nthese provisions\n\n\nAnd in fact I do remember that he was the one who called me in the\noffice of Commissioner Ong, to do the finishing touches, on all of\nthese provisions, \n\n\nSo Your Honor, as Vice Chairman of the Committee, he has to\nfulfill his duty, \n\n\nAnd as I 've said, I 'm not aware of such written objection, \nand this Committee report does not state such reservation, \n\n<$A> \n\nMr Speaker <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nYes yes\n\n<$A> \n\nThe uh gentleman from the first district of the province of\nCebu the Honorable Antonio Bacaltos be recognized to interpellate the sponsor\n\n<$D> \n\nMay I be allowed   to,  \n\n<$B> \n\n Any member  any member can stand up and seek\nrecognition of the Chair without having to clear with the Majority Leader\nshould the any member wish to interpellate\n\n\nThe Chair recognizes the gentleman from Cebu, and the sponsor\nmay yield if he so desires, \n\n<$E> \n\nThank you Mr Speaker, \n\n<$A> \n\nThe gentleman from Cebu, has sought uh permission of the\nsponsor to interpellate\n\n\nAnd the sponsor may yield if he so desires, \n\n<$D> \n\nYes Your Honor go ahead\n\n<$E> \n\nMr Speaker Your Honor, may I be allowed to ask whether\nthere is any difference or distinction between the word \"  \nad valorem  \" tax and excise tax,  ad valorem\n\n tax and excise tax\n\n\nIs there any distinction between   the  two\n\n<$D> \n\n Excise tax   Your Honor is a term that is used on\nspecific items uh it is a kind of tax Your Honor\n\n\nThe  ad valorem  Your Honor is based on value\n, \n\n<$E> \n\nValue\n\n\nNow may I please refer Your Honor Mr Speaker to the provision of\n, one one eight four six two letter D found on the fourth page of the Bill\n\n\nNow what really is the intent of the Committee insofar as the word\n, \"  ad valorem  \" tax of of sixty-five\npercent open parenthesis sixty-five percent close parenthesis of the  wholesale price and fifty-five percent, open parenthesis\nfigure fifty-five percent close parenthesis beginning July one nineteen\nninety, \n\n\nIs this not to be understood that there is a reduction of the\n\n ad valorem  tax, July one nineteen ninety\n\n\nIn other words from sixty-five it has to be reduced to fifty-five\npercent\n\n<$D> \n\nThat is correct Your Honor and this is pursuant to a\ncommitment made by the government, uh pursuant to the General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade uh, with a syncronym uh acronym rather, GATT\n\n\nThis is one of the GATT provisions\n\n<$E> \n\nUh there is uh does it have to be understood therefore that uh\ninstead of increasing it has to be reduced\n\n\nBecause what I understand in the caption of this Bill is that, \nand it reads as follows an act increasing the  ad valorem  \ntax on fermented liquors, uh an act increasing the excise tax on\ndistilled spirits wines fermented liquor and cigarettes amending for the\npurpose section one thirty-eight one thirty-nine one hundred forty and one\nhundred forty-two open parenthesis C close parenthesis and open parenthesis D\nclose parenthesis of the national Internal Revenue Code as amended\n\n\nAm I therefore, wrong in my  perception that this\nwould amount to a reduction instead of an increase so that the government\nwill profit by way of increasing tax on imported cigarettes\n\n<$D> \n\nThe gentleman is correct Your Honor and perhaps at the\nappropriate time the title of the Bill may be amended\n\n\nBut the point here Mr Speaker is that uh the government does not\ncollect anything on imported cigarettes because nobody pays taxes on imported\ncigarettes\n\n\nAnd the reduction Your Honor is to make the imported cigarettes at\npar with locally manufactured cigarettes bearing a foreign brand which will\nbe also fifty-five percent\n\n\nAnd this as I have said Your Honor is one of the commitments made\nby the government, uh pursuant to the uh General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade\n\n<$E> \n\nSo the subsequent question will be in this manner\n\n\nUh, do you think it would be proper to incorporate this\nprovision relating to letter D of uh section one hundred forty-two\nconsidering that what is within the contemplation as explained by Your Honor\nMr Speaker is that it has to be reduced or was it because is it because of\nthe reduction contemplated in letter D that there was sort of a conformity on\nthe part of the distinguished author that at the time of amendment such an\namendment might uh come in for introduction, \n\n<$D> \n\nYour Honor perhaps what could be done is to amend the title\nof the Bill\n\n\nBecause Your Honor what we are doing really is shooting two birds\n\n\nOur government made a commitment to, uh other countries and uh\naccording to other countries pursuant to the discussion made by our\ngovernment our government cannot use should not use, internal taxes, to\nprotect domestically  uh produced products which are of the\nsame kind as the one being exported to us", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

Appropriating the Sum of Ten Billion Pesos for Aid Relief And Rehabilitation Services for Certain Areas and for the Repair and Construction of Permanent Structures Affected by the Earthquake of July Sixteen Nineteen Ninety \", \n\n<$B> \n\nThe Chair uh recognizes   the distinguished  Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations the Honorable uh Rolando Andaya \n\n<$A> \n\nHonorable  Andaya Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations   \n\n<$C> \n\nThank you Mr Speaker, \n\n\nMr Speaker my distinguished colleagues ladies and gentlemen I will speak very briefly Mr Speaker and my dear colleagues because uh this measure uh is uh of utmost urgency\n\n\nThis bill, House Bill number three one four four eight, which was certified as urgent by the President of the Philippines, in her communication to the Speaker dated July twenty-one nineteen ninety, seeks to appropriate ten billion pesos for aid relief and rehabilitation services to people and areas and for the repair and reconstruction of government infrastructures affected by the strong temblor that struck the Philippines very recently, \n\n\nThe temblor that shook Luzon Island in the afternoon of July sixteen nineteen ninety recorded recorded at seven point seven on the Richter 's scale is one of the strongest and most destructive in our history\n\n\nMr Speaker only two days after the quake five hundred twenty-eight were reported dead one thousand one hundred twenty-three injured and over one thousand persons still trapped in buildings while fifteen thousand six hundred forty-six families were reported to have been left homeless with the destruction of one thousand seven hundred eighty-five houses\n\n\nThe damage to highways and bridges water systems power lines hospitals and school buildings and other public infrastructures run into billions of pesos\n\n\nBecause of the massive devastation Mr Speaker President Corazon C Aquino issued Proclamation number six thirteen declaring several cities and provinces under state of calamity\n\n\nWhile significant government efforts have been done to alleviate the suffering of the people affected by this calamity a supplemental budget is necessary to speed up the process of rehabilitation, for the families of the victims and the reconstruction of the affected areas\n\n\nHence Mr Speaker this urgent bill for our favorable consideration and immediate approval\n\n\nThank you Mr Speaker\n\n<$D> \n\nMr Speaker please Mr Speaker\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat 's the pleasure of the gentleman from Agusan del Sur\n\n<$D> \n\nAgusan del Norte Mr Speaker\n\n<$B> \n\nAgusan del Norte\n\n<$D> \n\nUh may the distinguished sponsor yield to some clarificatory questions\n\n<$B> \n\nThe gentleman may yield if he if he so desires\n\n<$C> \n\nVery willingly Mr Speaker\n\n<$D> \n\nNumber one Mr Speaker I do not wish to be misunderstood that I am against this bill\n\n\nBut this must be asked necessarily in order that this bill may really respond to the desired aims\n\n\nSo Mr Speaker the first question I would like to ask is, in the light of my experience every bill of this kind is always subjected to the objection anchored on our  the Constitutional provision that special appropriations, must always be accompanied by a certificate from the National Treasurer on the availability of funds or in the absence thereof that it must have a revenue measure accompanying such bill to support the funds desired\n\n\nNow in this particular bill, uh I I do not see these things despite the urgency Mr uh Speaker\n\n<$C> \n\nThe point is well taken Mr Speaker\n\n\nIndeed the Constitution provides that a supplemental appropriation of this nature should be accompanied by a revenue measure out of which funds can be generated, or certificate of availability of funds issued by the National Treasurer\n\n\nWe have Your Honor the corresponding certificate of availability of funds for this purpose\n\n\nIn fact we have here inside this hall uh the National Treasurer herself Ms uh Rose Cajucom who issued the certificate of availability of funds to support this House Bill three one four four eight\n\n<$D> \n\nWell uh I asked this Mr Speaker because I do not like that our rhetorics will not be accompanied by the necessary heroics\n\n\nBecause I was so told and it was printed in the papers that we are running a deficit of approximately eleven or seventeen billion\n\n\nIf we are running a deficit that much then there is a problem about availability of funds\n\n\nBut anyway I 'll not dispute this anyway\n\n\nIf Mr Cajucom   uh  Ms Cajucom is already here and you know in Visayan  Cajucom is \" judgment \" and if she wears that family name as a judgment uh that there is I have no right to dispute Mr Speaker\n\n\nThat was only for clarification\n\n\nThank you Mr Speaker\n\n<$C> \n\n Ms Cajucom   \n\n<$B> \n\nThank you\n\n<$?> \n Mr Speaker Mr Speaker the gentleman from uh Bukidnon\n\n<$E> \n\nWill the gentleman the honorable sponsor yield to a few questions Mr Speaker\n\n<$B> \n The gentleman may yield if he so desires\n\n<$C> \n\nWillingly Mr Speaker Your Honor\n\n<$E> \n\nThis is only a follow-up uh question of the honorable gentleman from Agusan\n\n\nMr Speaker we have no objections if there is availability of funds\n\n\nBut we would like only to know Mr Speaker where will this availability of funds be coming from\n\n\nBecause we have also commitments to our constituents where we are willing to sacrifice for as long as we are advised so that our own constituents will not be hoping for this to come while we are transferring it to the affected areas\n\n\nWe just want to know this Mr Speaker because uh it will be very difficult if my constituents in my district Mr Speaker are expecting all the fundings already appropriated for and approved under this Appropriations Act of nineteen ninety and then the money will come from there it is alright with us\n\n\nBut I will make the announcement that we will have to sacrifice we will not expect anything this year because we 're giving it to our brothers in the north who have been affected\n\n\nWe would like to know this Mr Speaker rather than having our constituents hoping for this and never come again Mr Speaker and we will be blamed for it\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm that 's a good point Mr Speaker but uh I would like to call the attention of the distinguished gentleman from Bukidnon that precisely section one of the bill provides that it shall be from funds in the National Treasury not otherwise appropriated\n\n\n  Because  if we do not put that phraseology of \" funds not otherwise appropriated \" I share the concern of the distinguished gentleman from Bukidnon that it 's very possible that this amount to support the ten billion would be taken from the funds already appropriated including those for the projects in Bukidnon\n\n<$E> \n\n So   \n\n\nSo we are made to understand that Mr Speaker that the ten billion already certified by the National Treasury will not affect any approved appropriated funds for nineteen ninety\n\n<$C> \n\nTo my thinking Your Honor this should not affect adversely\n\n<$E> \n\nSo this money will come from other sources   that may be from savings  or other incomes of   the government  \n\n<$C> \n\n Yes Your Honor    yes   \n\n<$E> \n\nThank you Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nThank you\n\n<$F> \n\nMr Speaker\n\n<$G> \n\nMr Speaker\n\n<$B> \n\nThe gentleman from Bohol\n\n<$F> \n\nThank you Mr Speaker\n\n\nWill the sponsor yield to a few questions\n\n<$B> \n\nThe sponsor may yield\n\n<$G> \n\nMr Speaker there are two gentlemen from Bohol now on the floor\n\n\nMay I please know which uh gentleman is being recognized\n\n<$B> \n\nThe gentleman from the opposition\n\n<$G> \n\nUh may I have the reservation that after the gentleman from the opposition from Bohol will be through with the interpellation that this representation be accorded the same privilege\n\n<$B> \n\nThe other gentleman from Bohol may seek recognition   after uh  the  uh the gentleman from the opposition in Bohol shall have uh finished with his interpellation\n\n<$G> \n\n Thank you   \n\n<$F> \n\nThank you Mr Speaker\n\n\nMay we know from the sponsor as to whether there is such a thing as, funds in the National Treasury not already appropriated\n\n<$C> \n\nWell actually we have funds in the treasury\n\n\nWe have funds in the different government owned or controlled banks\n\n\nWe even have funds in the uhm Central Bank, \n\n\nBut you see I would like to explain this Your Honor that uh this ten billion will not be spent in one sweep, \n\n\nWe are just giving the authority to the Executive to incur obligations and disburse later on\n\n\nBecause even if we have the money in the world even if we have money in the  bodegas  without this appropriation measure that centavo or that money cannot be spent\n\n\nSo this is some kind of a standby appropriation\n\n\nWhat we need is the authority from Congress in order to enable the Executive branch to attend to the victims of the earthquake and to reconstruct or rehabilitate the affected affected infrastructures of government\n\n<$F> \n\nDoes it mean Mr Speaker that we do not know as of the present whether we have this ten billion pesos available from the funds in the National Treasury\n\n<$C> \n\nWell uh according to the Treasurer of the Philippines, the funds will be made  available, \n\n\nAnd then uh if you ask me the possible sources well we have just passed the \" sin taxes \" \n\n\nIt should generate three point four billion\n\n\nRemember the sin taxes were supposed to be for the veterans\n\n\nBut the amount for veterans would amount only to  mga  about one point seven\n\n\nAnd then per report of the Finance Secretary we had increased collection at least for the first quarter of two hundred  forty million pesos\n\n\nBut uh it is very possible that bonds will be circulated reconstruction bonds would be sold to institutional investors reconstruction bonds because we have money for example in insurance companies\n\n\nThey have plenty of money\n\n\nThey would like to have investments\n\n\nWe have retirement funds\n\n\nWe have commercial funds\n\n\nThese can be invested in bonds\n\n\nAnd uh we have we can float bonds for the overseas workers because we have  dollar deposits of overseas workers in the F C D U Foreign Currency Deposit Units of the different banks here in the Philippines\n\n\nThese dollar deposits may be used to purchase these uh dollar bonds\n\n\nAnd uh it is very possible if we are short of funds it is very possible we have friends countries\n\n\nWe have reconstruction bonds A D B World Bank at very very concessional rates to reconstruct\n\n\nBut in the meantime because it takes time to do all those things\n\n\nThese banks would uh want to be presented feasibility studies what are these projects to be undertaken the costing\n\n\nIt will take time\n\n\nBut Congress should give the authority to the Executive branch to implement all these things to alleviate the sufferings of the victims and to reconstruct the damage\n\n<$F> \n\nThank you   Mr Speaker  \n\n<$C> \n\n And   uh if it is possible if our creditors would be too sympathetic I just filed a a resolution that perhaps we should be given suspension of payments for a period of two years\n\n\nBecause Mr Speaker it is not only the increased expenditure of ten billion\n\n\nThis is a double kill\n\n\nIt is very possible there is going to be reduced income\n\n\nThere will be increased expenditure and at the same time reduced income\n\n\nThere are mining companies that have been devastated by this earthquake\n\n\nReal estate taxes will suffer\n\n\nThe taxes that were paid before by commercial establishments would not be paid\n\n\nPerhaps even income taxes would suffer\n\n\nBut in the meantime that we have the money after all as certified we now should give this authority so that Congress shows its concern that in the midst of this devastation Congress is in a position to act immediately", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL",

from Pasay the joint committee uh manifests that uh uh there are no more sponsorship speeches and that we move to uh uh the committee is ready for interpellations, \n\n<$A> \n\nThere being no

Sorsogon is recognized\n\n<$D> \n\nThank you Mr Speaker\n\n\nWill the distinguished uh sponsor yield to a few questions Mr Speaker\n\n<$B> \n\nUh most certainly uh Mr Speaker and with great pleasure knowing that the  experience of the gentleman from Sorsogon will uh enhance uh the bill being discussed\n\n<$D> \n\nThank you Your Honor, \n\n\nYour Honor this representation is in accord, with the committee and the sponsors of this uh piece of legislation\n\n\nBut at the same time this representation entertains a lot of doubt whether the creation of a council will really serve the purposes or the interest of the small and medium-scale entrepreneurs\n\n\nThe reason being it is a standard impression that is getting to be a joke in the bureaucracy that if you want something to fail you refer it either to a committee or to a council\n\n\nIn fact the number one, or what I would say an exhibit A of a council that is not effective at all is the National Security Council that has never been convened for the past four to five years\n\n\nAnd so Your Honor, my first question is that rather than creating a council did the committee study the possibility of just simply strengthening giving all of these functions to the still existing Bureau of Small and Medium-Scale Office\n\n<$B> \n\nUh that was actually uh considered by uh the joint committee uh Mr Speaker\n\n\nBut in reply to the query of uh the gentleman from Sorsogon, the matter of coordinating the various efforts of the various agencies was also brought to  fore  \n\n\nUh the joint committees uh determined that the mere  fortification  of the functions of one body would not be sufficient because the solution lies in a uh complete approach which would involve several agencies of the government that have uh uh something to do with the promotion of small and medium enterprises\n\n\nAnd uh a full coordination of these uh functions uh belonging to these bodies was uh considered as uh essential together with of course the specification of definite directions which are laid down in the proposed bill\n\n<$D> \n\nThank you Your Honor\n\n\nDoes it mean therefore Your Honor that for us to expect the various departments to have coordinated policies to have coordinated actions there is always a need to include the various departments in a particular cluster and therefore compose a council\n\n\nMeaning it is not feasible Your Honor for these various departments to make coordination an inherent character considering that anyway these cabinet members are coordinated by the Office of the President\n\n<$B> \n\nUh Mr Speaker it is not only uh the uh department or cabinet secretaries who are presently involved in the uh uh development of uh small and medium industries\n\n\nThere are sub-cabinet uh offices and agencies which are involved\n\n\nAs a matter of fact there are something like thirty agencies uh which have something to do with small and medium enterprises\n\n\nNow to the question of the gentleman from Sorsogon uh it is not essential to include all thirty but only the more relevant and more important agencies with the important functions\n\n<$D> \n\nThank you Your Honor, \n\n\nYour Honor a commendable feature of this particular Council is the fact that the Chairman will be selected appointed by the President from amongst the representatives of the private, sector\n\n\nMay the distinguished sponsor give us if any examples of present government councils headed by a private sector representative as a chairman so that we could have an impression as to whether such an arrangement indeed is workable\n\n<$B> \n\nI can think of only one uh uh although there might be others\n\n\nBut at the moment I can come up with only one example which is the uh uh P A P or the Philippine Assistance Program, \n\n<$D> \n\nThank you Your Honor\n\n\nAt least uh before the Chairman resigned that particular agency was performing I would say above uh average\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd if I if I may add uh Mr Chairman it is still performing above average which only goes to show that uh this particular uh Council \" i e \" the P A P uh is uh functioning not because of a particular personality but because of the structure and the members included therein\n\n<$D> \n\nI wish indeed that uh such uh was the case\n\n\nMr Chairman Mr Speaker Your Honor I don't see any budgetary appropriation for this, Council\n\n<$B> \n\nUh we we   have this uh  \n\n<$D> \n\n Do we   expect this Council to be effective without any budgetary uh appropriation\n\n<$B> \n\nWell there is uh Mr uh Speaker, a uh, section namely section seven which designates the Bureau of Small and Medium Enterprise Development as the Council Secretariat\n\n\nSince that particular agency has its own budget then uh the joint committee felt that uh the budget for the  operating uh  operations of this particular Council could be drawn from uh said uh uh agency, \n\n<$D> \n\nMay we know Your Honor what uh, is the present budget of this particular office in our uh Appropriations Act for nineteen ninety-nine nineteen ninety\n\n<$B> \n\nI I do not have the exact figure but uh I 'm sure the uh General Appropriations Act for nineteen ninety would uh easily give that information\n\n<$D> \n\nI hope Your Honor it is significant enough to be able to finance the additional functions to be given to that uh office\n\n\n  Another  \n\n<$B> \n\n Actually   actually Mr Speaker while uh the Bureau of Small and Medium Enterprise Development will be the Council Secretariat the uh coordination which will be done among the various agencies which I mentioned before would also involve said agencies and therefore uh in a way would also involve part of their part of their uh budgets\n\n<$D> \n\nThank you Your Honor\n\n\nYour Honor for the information of the members of the chamber may we know how this particular bill would jibe with an earlier piece of legislation the House already approved\n\n\nThis representation is referring to the Plaza Bill from Agusan on uh the overall economic umbrella on organization a bill which has been pending in the Senate for almost two to three months, \n\n<$B> \n\nUh Mr Speaker uh in order for this representation to uh uh fully uh answer the query of the gentleman from  from Sorsogon may I request for a one-minute suspension\n\n<$A> \n\nSession suspended  \n\n\nSession resumed\n\n<$B> \n\nMr Speaker the bill of uh, Honorable D O Plaza makes or provides for a business information center\n\n\nMeaning uh the thrust uh is uh focused on the dissemination of business information\n\n\nHowever the bill in question or uh the bill under consideration is not confined to the dissemination of business information because uh the bill encompasses uh the development of technology the uh facilitation of credit and the development of markets\n\n\nSo uh if this representation will be allowed to capsulize the difference while the bill of Honorable D O Plaza is specialized focusing on one particular activity the bill under consideration uh has for its uh objective uh the performance of several functions\n\n<$D> \n\nThank you uh Your Honor\n\n\nMy final uh question uh Your Honor or maybe an observation is that insofar as councils wherein various secretaries or heads of departments are represented are involved the common experience of this representation is that invariably these various heads of departments would send their representatives\n\n\nGood enough if they would send their immediate deputy or undersecretary\n\n\nBut considering that the Secretary of Trade and Industry most especially I understand he sits in as many as nineteen or twenty board offices I doubt very much really Mr Speaker Your Honor whether the good Secretary of Trade and Industry the Secretary of Agriculture Secretary of Labor and Employment would have the time to sit in this Council\n\n\nSo I hope the sponsors would consider the possibility of having as members of the Council sub-cabinet personalities who will indeed represent their various departments in practically full-time  uh capacity\n\n<$B> \n\nWe uh concur with the observation of the gentleman from Sorsogon that uh in most uh councils and or committees where department secretaries are  ex-officio  members or are members by reason of their position most of the uh members send subalterns who are invariably well or almost invariably unfamiliar with the uh uh task involved and worse uh no continuity uh is uh observed\n\n\nIn other words uh a particular department secretary would send for one week uh subaltern A and then for the second week subaltern B and for the third week subaltern C\n\n\nUh there is no continuity of effort and uh as a result the work of the council and or the committee is uh jeopardized\n\n\nWe are amenable to uh an amendment\n\n\nAs a matter of fact the committee uh is even offering to present that as one of the committee amendments to uh stipulate in the bill that uh a specific undersecretary for example uh shall be uh uh the only acceptable uh substitute or representative of the member who might be in uh who might be unable to attend\n\n<$D> \n\nThank you Your Honor\n\n\nThank you Mr Speaker\n\n<$E> \n\nMr Speaker\n\n<$A> \n\nYes what is the pleasure of the gentleman from Quezon\n\n<$E> \n\nUhm will the uh Honorable sponsor the Chairman on the Committee on Trade and Industry yield to some questions Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nUh with uh pleasure Mr Speaker to the gentleman from Quezon who has uh uh incorporated in his uh political philosophy the assistance to small uh uh to small uh business uh concerns in our country\n\n<$E> \n\nThank you Your Honor\n\n\nUh I suppose uh that in uh the drafting of this proposed measure the committee was uh also guided by the experience of uh South Korea and Taiwan\n\n\nAm I correct Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nUh to a certain uh and substantial extent yes Mr Speaker\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd uh I understand that these economies before they uh engaged in full industrialization uh took off from small and medium-scale enterprises Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nUh that is correct Mr Speaker and uh we uh we would like to uh learn from the lessons uh from successful lessons uh of our neighbors\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd and these economies were able to do that by uh imposing more commitment and better coordination among uh the government agencies in small and uh medium-scale uh enterprises in their countries\n\n\nAm I correct Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nUh that is uh very accurate Mr Speaker\n\n<$E> \n\nI am asking these questions Your Honor uh uh because I would like to know what government agencies are presently involved in the promotion of small and medium-scale enterprises in this country\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh Mr Speaker uh definitely the Department of Trade and Industry is involved in a big way\n\n\nThe uh the Department of Agriculture is likewise uh very concerned with uh small and medium enterprises especially uh those uh in the agricultural or agro-industrial field\n\n\nThe Secretary of Labor and Employment uh since uh its vision is to provide employment and it looks at small and medium enterprises as a rich source of uh uh generating employment\n\n\nThe uh Secretary of Finance because it is the fund generator of the government\n\n\nUh the uh National Economic and Development Authority because uh insofar as uh high policy or top policy matters are concerned it can be deemed as the coordinator uh among others uh Mr Speaker\n\n<$E> \n\nI understand Your Honor that presently the the efforts of the Departments of Trade Agriculture Labor Finance NEDA uhm towards uh promoting small and uh medium scale enterprises are not uh adequately coordinated at present\n\n\nThat 's why there is need uh for us to come up with a measure such as the measure under consideration\n\n\nAm I correct Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nThat is correct Mr Speaker because aside from uh the small and medium enterprises uh matters uh these agencies and the others who are involved in small and medium enterprises also have to attend to a myriad of uh other activities\n\n\nAnd the reason for uh the creation of the Council is to ensure that within that milieu the concentration of their coordination will be towards small and medium enterprises\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd I suppose that

{"text": "<$A> \n\nMr Speaker, \n\n<$B> \n\nWhat is the pleasure of the   gentleman from Isabela  \n\n<$A> \n\n Will the gentleman   yield to a few questions\n\n<$B> \n\nHe still has the floor if he wishes to yield\n\n<$C> \n\nWillingly Mr Speaker\n\n<$A> \n\nUh thank you Mr Speaker\n\n\nThis uh insurgency problem has been the problem that has been confronting us for the past uh two decades, \n\n\nAnd uh I believe that uh the present uh insurgents uh the so called N P A C P C P A no N P A C P C P P, uh are the offshoots of uh the  HUKBALAHAP  movement uh which uh rose after the second world war\n\n\nAnd uh since then up to the present this has been the problem of uh our government\n\n\nUh do you think Your Honor that uh the bills that you have mentioned and uh which are still pending in the House would help in the solution of uh this problem\n\n<$C> \n\nI believe so Mr Speaker Your Honor because uh the three bills I filed deals with the uh the surrenderees which will encourage them to surrender to the fold of the law because they are given incentives and they are uh they are given amnesty\n\n\nAside from the amnesty they will be given livelihood projects that will uh propel them towards economic uh stability economic uh development so that there will be no more reason for them to be staying in the hills which is a life of hardship uh being uh hunted forever by uh our military\n\n<$A> \n\nUh thank you Your Honor and uh I, am one who had uh some uh lengthy talks with uh surrenderees N P A surrenderees in my province in Isabela\n\n\nAnd the the reasons why they joined the movement or the insurgencts are uh varied, \n\n\nSome uh say that uh they were uh just invited to attend a seminar or a so-called meeting and uh after that they were, uh not allowed to get back to their homes anymore\n\n\nSome are uh, there because they are uh lazy to work on their farms, \n\n\nInstead of uh working in the farms they prefer to join the movement because it is an easier life for them although they would uh reside or stay in the forests, \n\n\nAnd uh some are uh are what we call uh \" ideologues \" or the those who are uh in the movement because uh of a desire to fight this democratic form of government\n\n\nYour Honor would these uh three bills which you filed uh covers these uh matters which I have uh presented\n\n<$C> \n\nYes uh Mr Speaker Your Honor these three bills will really cover the the varied reasons why there are so many uh being attracted to the N P A C P P side, \n\n\nBut I think uh although you have mentioned some of the reasons why they are uh joining the N P A the C P P I believe however that the main reason is really uh economic uh difficulties being encountered by these people\n\n\nYou know it is uh it is uh better for them to join the N P A because at least they are provided with food they are provided with what they need uh for their daily livelihood and they don't have uh the problem of uh trying to find this uh daily living uh uh things that they need in their uh daily life\n\n\nSo that by joining the C P P N P A they are uh provided with their uh livelihood\n\n\nSo if the government will try to to give them amnesty and uh at the same time after they have surrendered they are given the proper uh incentives like uh livelihood programs which we can very well afford I think uh there will be no more reason no more overriding reason for these people to still continue fighting the government\n\n\nI don't believe that uh these people are imbued with the ideologies of communism that uh they cannot uh part with it\n\n\nThere are I  I would say there are a very few number that are uh really dyed to the wool in their skin uh because of the ideology of communism but uh it is an exception rather than the rule\n\n\nSo that I would say that generally speaking the N P A people now uh who have uh turned away from the government can easily be uh urged to come back to the fold of the law by giving them the proper incentives uh giving them livelihood\n\n<$A> \n\nI fully agree with the gentleman and uh, I would say that uh principally there are two kinds of uh N P As or C P P the ideologues and those who have joined the movement or the insurgency because of uh economic uh necessity\n\n\nFor those who have joined <unclear> word </unclear> economic necessity Your Honor I believe that they are more in number than the ideologues or those who believe in communism\n\n<$C> \n\nThat 's true\n\n<$A> \n\nWould you uh agree with me Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nI fully agree uh Mr Speaker Your Honor because I mentioned that already that uh there are uh I think the biggest number of them are due to economic hardships economic difficulties that they are encountering in uh our present uh economy in the country\n\n\nThere are so many people who have no jobs at all so that uh they find it difficult uh to support their family that is why that is the very compelling reason why they have joined the C P P N P A because at least by joining this uh rebel unit at least they are uh assured of their daily livelihood\n\n\nWhereas if they will continue to earn their living they cannot find jobs they will find really serious difficulties trying to support their families\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I must confess to the honorable gentleman that uh I did not have uh time to read very well the bills filed\n\n\nWould the bill three bills uh cover incentive that would uh give uh proper uh invitation to the members who to these people who are shall we say we call uh \" misguided \" for them to come back to the folds of the law\n\n<$C> \n\nI am uh more or less certain about that Mr Speaker Your Honor because uh aside from giving them full amnesty if uh the rebels are sincere this will be of course uh through a screening committee they will be determined whether their uh surrendering is really genuine or sincere in their effort\n\n\nAnd then uh aside from giving them full amnesty uh as I mentioned already they give uh they are given economic support in the form of livelihood projects which uh is being called under House Bill number two three two eight zero which is entitled \" An Act Providing Full Amnesty to Surrenderees and Economic Support in the Form of Livelihood Projects \" \n\n\nSo that coupling these all these things which are all in favor of the surrenderees I believe that there is no reason why they will not uh come back to the fold of the law\n\n\nThere is no reason for them to stay in the hills because it 's very hard for them to be staying in the hills away from their families and uh to be roaming around being hunted by the military wherever they are uh situated\n\n<$A> \n\nUh Your Honor uh usually the reasons they give in rising against uh the government is because this government is a capitalist uh economy because this government is full of uh corruption and graft and the this government is not uh uh serving the people as they should be served\n\n\nUh do we have uh enough reasons to combat or to say answer these uh allegations or contention of these insurgents, \n\n<$C> \n\nWell at least on the aspect of uh graft and corruption I would say that uh as a matter of fact I was the principal author of the bill which we passed which was uh entitled \" The Anti-Red Tape Bill \" which has already passed by which has already been passed by this House on third reading and it is uh with the Conference Committee with the Senate as they have also passed uh a similar measure in the Senate uh\n\n\nUh  ano  aside from that we have already passed also the Code of Ethical Standards uh Prescribed for Government Officials and Employees which is a guideline for uh the government officials and employees to follow so that they will not be tempted to commit any graft and corruption\n\n\nSo these two measures alone are uh enough if they are being uh implemented by our government to stop the graft and corruption which is uh which is rampant now in our government\n\n\nI nobody can deny that the, rampancy of graft and corruption in our government is really real not only imaginary but real\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yes Your Honor I made mention of this because this has been the issue raised by the insurgents ever since uh this movement was uh there as a problem\n\n\nAnd so I was thinking there that there must be something wrong with this uh system\n\n\nDon't you think so Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nI cannot pinpoint uh Mr Speaker Your Honor the exact cause why there are so many people being tempted to commit graft and corruption\n\n\nUh whereas before, uh during the time of the late President Marcos the corruption was only observable and uh seen in the higher echelons\n\n\nNow it is creeping to the very lowest limit or level of our uh government offices and agencies\n\n\nSo I would say I cannot pinpoint really what is the cause but maybe it is also due to uh economic difficulties being uh uh experienced by our government employees uh having uh only very, meager salaries which are which are even below poverty line and probably this must be the reason why uh they are uh indulging in this uh graft and corruption business\n\n<$A> \n\nUh do we get it from Your Honor that uh graft and corruption is more rampant uh under this administration than in the previous uh one\n\n<$C> \n\nWell if you consider that as more rampant when we speak that uh during the time of President Marcos graft and corruption was limited to the higher echelons of government\n\n\nAnd now it is seeping to the very lowest level of uh uh government, then I would say that it is even more\n\n<$A> \n\nNow uh uh this graft and corruption as I said is one of the reasons why the N P A C P P insurgents are uh fighting the government\n\n\nDo you think uh Your Honor that uh this graft and corruption is a necessary evil or part of this system of democratic form of government\n\n<$C> \n\nNo Mr Speaker Your Honor I don't believe that this is a necessary part of our system of government\n\n\nAs a matter of fact President Aquino has been instituting uh measures uh implementing measures to fight graft and corruption\n\n\nI think she is uh sincere in her efforts uh against graft and corruption\n\n\nBut it 's only that uh that I think it has already seeped into the mentality of the Filipino working man, especially the government employees that uh for example a certain uh individual goes to a certain office and asks for a certain document he will uh purposely delay the production or uh completion of that document in order to have some uh grease money to be  given by the one seeking the document so that uh probably that is the reason why uh he is tempted to commit graft because of the inkling to have the money before he can accomplish anything\n\n\nWhat he thinks in his uh service is no longer a he does not consider anymore that uh a public office is a public trust but rather that a public office is a means wherein he can enrich himself\n\n\nThat is the very reason why some of our government employees are uh indulging in this to help them economically solve their uh problems", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nMr President distinguished colleagues, in June, students go back to school\n\n\nToday enrolment is going on\n\n\nWe are again faced with the challenge of tuition fees how much what amount of increases what other charges how many students may not enroll because they can no longer afford\n\n\nWe have already mandated Mr President allowable increase in Republic Act sixty-seven twenty-eight under certain conditions because we recognize that schools must pay increased salaries must meet rising costs must upgrade needed facilities like laboratories\n\n\nThe issue therefore is not just increases but whether or not the conditions for increases have been observed by the proper officials as prescribed by law\n\n\nWe submit Mr President that the Secretary of Education has violated the law that he has disregarded the conditions for the increases of tuition fees\nthat he has relegated unto himself certain powers vested by law in other entities relegated them unto himself\n\n\nPreviously Mr President before the enactment of Republic Act sixty-seven twenty-eight the Secretary of Education had the power to prescribe school tuition fees under the Education Act of nineteen eighty-two as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the case of Philippine Consumers Foundation versus the Secretary of Education one hundred and fifty three SCRA sixty-two\n\n\nIn that case Mr President the Philippine Consumers Foundation sought to prohibit the Secretary of DECS from fixing tuition increases because the power to regulate according to them did not include the power to authorize increases\n\n\nAnd secondly they said because the parents and students concerned, whose tuition fees were increases were increased were never given notice never given an opportunity to be heard\n\n\nAnd therefore they said they were denied the constitutional right of due process\n\n\nSupreme Court Mr President in that case held that the power to regulate school fees at that time included the power to authorize increases citing specific provisions of the Education Act\n\n\nIt 's also said that there existed no denial of due process because the authorization was for general application as when the authorization was for increases to apply to all private schools throughout the country\n\n\nBut Mr President that was yesterday\n\n\nToday we have Republic Act sixty-seven twenty-eight and section ten of said law categorically states that in any proposed increases any in the private schools there must be appropriate consultations conducted by the school administration with the duly organized parent and  associations and faculty associations with respect to secondary schools\n\n\nAnd for colleges with student governments with student councils alumni and factory faculty associations and in all cases audited financial statements are required\n\n\nThe law Mr President classifies schools into two categories\n\n\nFirst those charging less than one thousand five hundred pesos a year for high schools and eighty pesos per unit for colleges during the school years nineteen eighty-eight to nineteen ninety uh to nineteen eighty-nine\n\n\nThe second category Mr President refers to schools and colleges charging said amounts or more\n\n\nThe first group of schools are still regulated\n\n\nBut they are  regulated no longer by the DECS no longer by the Secretary of the Department of Education insofar as tuition fees are concerned but by the State Assistance Council as provided by law\n\n\nThe second group comprises schools and colleges that are deregulated\n\n\nThey charge tuition fees higher than one thousand five hundred pesos for high school and eighty pesos or more per unit for college\n\n\nAny increase in tuition fees should be made by the schools but always in consultation with the designated parties not by the DECS or with the DECS\n\n\nThere appears Mr President several violations \n\n The first is that the State Assistance Council does not have a student representative does not have a teacher representative as required by law\n\n\nThe State Assistance Council as organized today was established precisely to render assistance to students and teachers in that regulated category\n\n\nBecause the law Mr President that we forged here seeks to help deserving students\n\n\nAnd the law therefore created the State Assistance Council composed of the DECS Secretary the Department of Budget and Management representatives the Department of Science and Technology the students designate a teacher representative and a representative of the school\n\n\nThis collegial body Mr President gives free tuition and subsidies to deserving students like valedictorians and salutatorians\n\n\nAnd therefore they  they are the ones who determine how many will be given subsidies how many will be free from any tuition and therefore determine how much would be the tuition fee increases if any\n\n\nThey must also decide, as already pointed out Mr President the rules and regulations pertaining to increase tuition fees and other fees\n\n\nThis refers to schools charging less than one thousand five hundred pesos a year for high schools and for college not more than eighty pesos per unit in other words the still regulated category of schools\n\n\nBut whether the increases are regulated by the State Assistance Council or not Mr President the fact remains that consultations are required audited financial statements are needed\n\n\nThe division of the increase seventy percent to go to salaries and wages for teachers and non-teaching personnel must be observed\n\n\nTwenty percent for upgrading of facilities must be implemented\n\n\nAnd in the light of the law there appears several violations Mr President\n\n\nOne there are no teachers no student representatives in the State Assistance Council\n\n\nHow can they function adequately if there exists no voice from the students and the teachers no vote from these affected parties\n\n\nSecond violation Mr President Secretary Cari&ntilde;o issued DECS Order number thirty dated March eleven nineteen ninety-one prescribing tuition fees when he no longer has the power to do so\n\n\nThis power is now lodged for schools in the first category with the State Assistance Council and the schools themselves\n\n\nAnd the second category with the schools Mr President provided that consultations and the other conditions like audited financial statements are complied with\n\n\nThird violation as a result there exists faulty implementation\n\n\nSometimes there are consultation many times there are none many times the schools merely inform\n\n\nAs of May twenty-second nineteen ninety-one Mr President Santa Scholastica College raised their tuition fees by twenty-five percent with consultations\n\n\nOn the other hand the National College of Business and Arts increased tuition fees by ten percent no consultations\n\n\nAteneo raised by twenty-five percent with consultations\n\n\nRizal Tech Colleges in Mandaluyong raised by five to ten percent no consultations\n\n\nCentral College of the Philippines increased by thirty percent no consultations\n\n\nAll of these Mr President are accredited institutions all are subject to the same law\n\n\nBut preliminary survey shows that there exists violations rather than adherence\n\n\nLast year alone fourteen schools supposedly violated the law\n\n\nIn nineteen eighty-nine the DECS National Capital Region alone Mr President reported seventy-five cases of tuition increases increased violation in spite of the existence of the mandate\n\n\nThe question is why\n\n\nWhat good is the law\n\n\nWhat good are the penalties provided for if the proper authorities cannot enforce the law, \n\n\nNumber four violation Mr President the DECS Secretary in his DECS Order number thirty fixed tuitions fees for upper students and said these schools are exempted from consultation provided the increases were within the limits that he prescribed\n\n\nHe has no business Mr President to fix rates no business to say no consultations no business to disregard financial audits\n\n\nMr President let us help\n\n\nThere is unrest already amongst the students\n\n\nThere are anxieties amongst parents\n\n\nThere is deep concern by the teachers\n\n\nAnd it seems that growing confusion is compounded by lack of adequate implementation\n\n\nLet the Committee on Education headed by Senator Angara look into this\n\n\nLet the students come let the teachers come let the State Assistance Council members come and tell us so that we will really know the problems and perhaps adopt proper solutions so that we rectify the wrong and help those aggrieved\n\n\nWe owe it to the nation Mr President\n\n\nWe owe it to ourselves\n\n\nWe owe it to the students and the teachers and the parties concerned\n\n\nThank you\n\n<$B> \n\nSenator Lina and then Senator Angara, \n\n<$C> \n\nThank you Mr President\n\n\nWill the Majority Floor Leader yield for some questions\n\n<$A> \n\nCertainly Mr President, \n\n<$C> \n\nFirstly Mr President I 'd like to congratulate uh the indefatigable uh Majority Floor Leader for taking up uh the cudgels for our uh youth who are still of uh school age\n\n\nUh we in the Committee on Youth and Sports Development uh join him in uh in this uh privilege uh speech entitled \" The Challenge to Tuition Fees \" \n\n\nWe are one with you Mr uh President in your uh, criticisms against the way Republic Act six seven two eight has been and is being implemented by the Department of Education Culture and Sports especially on the aspect of uh consultation as specified in section ten of the Republic Act uh mentioned\n\n\nUh this representation and together with the Senate President were the one who authored section ten of Republic Act six seven two eight on the need for consultation in all tuition increases\n\n\nHowever Mr President uh the justification being used by the DECS in issuing for example DECS Order number thirty and other previous orders is the is a certain opinion issued by the Department of Justice that uh if the increase in uh tuition is within the level of uh say one  one thousand below one thousand five hundred pesos a year uh for high schools\n\n\nSo schools charging less than one thousand five hundred pesos a year for high schools and eighty thousand  pesos per unit for colleges during school year nineteen eighty-eight eighty-nine they are no longered covered they are no longer covered by uh the provision on consultation\n\n\nIt 's only those schools that are charging above this level are the ones being uh uh mandated by the DECS to uh undertake this uh procedure on consultation\n\n\nNow uh therefore there is a stalemate uh at this point Mr President\n\n\nDECS is using the D O J opinion as the justification the D O J being the legal arm of the uh legal arm of the uh Executive uh branch uh has uh issued its uh opinion\n\n\nAnd then the DECS relies on that opinion\n\n\nBut I 'd like to know from uh our Majority Floor Leader what is his uh uh proposal\n\n\nHow will the students can uh effectively challenge the DECS Order number thirty considering that the DECS is relying on a D O J opinion\n\n\nWill the students have to go to the Supreme Court and resolve the issue there or should the students and the parents go to the to Congress and ask for a clarification through another piece of uh legislation\n\n\nMay we know the insights of the Majority Floor Leader on this uh issue Mr President\n\n<$A> \n\nThank you Mr President\n\n\nI think that the law is very clear\n\n\nIt has made no distinction\n\n\nIt refers to all increases not to the increases of those  uh schools under category one where the tuition is one thousand five hundred pesos and eighty pesos per unit respectively\n\n\nBut to all and where the law does not distinguish I don't think even the Secretary of Justice can distinguish\n\n\nSecondly Mr President it is the lower levels because  they  are the poorest students who really deserve more consultations\n\n\nIt is there where uh the audited financial statements are required\n\n\nIt is there where the seventy percent twenty percent allocation is needed because many of these schools and I do not want to disparage them but that is the reality in the provinces especially have rickety structures and very poor laboratories  etcetera  \n\n\nAnd yet these are the ones who are supposed to be regulated but no consultations\n\n\n what kind of uh uh protection do we give them if we remove the process of consultation Mr President\n\n\nAnd so therefore I submit that the best way is for uh us to clarify the intent of the Senate through perhaps a resolution after the investigation shall have been made\n\n<$C> \n\nWell Your Honor the matter is uh the matter is pending before the uh our Committee on uh Education headed by Senator Angara\n\n\nAnd time and again we have referred to this to this law particularly section ten on consultation because, uh to my mind it is the unanimous position already of the Senate\n\n\nFrom the Senate President uh down to this uh representation we have already uh come out with uh a position on this matter\n\n\nI 've read the statement coming from the Senate President that in all tuition increases  there should be a consultation\n\n\nAnd in fact uh as I said earlier this was so clarified during the uh proceeding here proceedings conducted on this on this bill when we were deliberating on this\n\n\nAnd we came up with a section ten uh precisely uh and also because all the sectors will be affected by the tuition increase will have to be consulted\n\n\nThe teachers for example who are supposed to benefit because seventy percent of the tuition increase should go to the salaries and wages of the of the teachers and a certain percentage will go to improvement of facilities\n\n\nAnd uh whether the increase is favorable or not  favorable to the teachers the teachers should be consulted and the students should be consulted\n\n\nSo it was very clear to our mind Mr President that uh there should be consultation in all in all increases\n\n\nAnd I think that 's also the view already expressed by the Chairman of the Committee on Education\n\n<$?> \n Yes\n\n<$C> \n\nBut the problem precisely is uh uh even if we pass a resolution here uh despite the preponderance of statements coming from this upper uh chamber uh on this issue of consultation the DECS continue to be uh belligerent\n\n\nUh I  I withdraw the word but uh it  it has stood pat on its uh position uh that the D O J uh position is that uh uh only those that are above the one thousand five hundred peso uh tuition in high school and those uh uh more than eighty pesos per unit in the tertiary level they are the only ones that uh require consultation the the schools charging those uh fees\n\n<$A> \n\n  Yes  \n\n<$B> \n\n I mean   so  'yon po ang uh 'yun po ang sitwasyon eh uh ang  implementation  ang  DECS\n\n\nIt relies on the D O J opinion despite the already statements coming from us here\n\n\nSo that is the situation\n\n\nDo you think a resolution uh passed by by this chamber will uh will be sufficient Mr President\n\n\nSupposing the the DECS again says no we are relying on the D O J opinion uh if this  has to be tested let this let it be tested to the to the court by the by the uh or you know let the parties go to the courts for final uh arbitration of the issue \n\n\n 'Yun ayun ho yata ang gustong mangyari ng  DECS\n\n<$A> \n\nWell the DECS itself Mr President through Secretary Cari&ntilde;o issued uh DECS Order number thirty of nineteen ninety-one series and in that Executive Order they fixed tuition fee increases for tertiary level for upper students\n\n<$C> \n\nAlso in high school Mr President\n\n<$A> \n\nYes and then they uh said no consultations for those who follow this prescription\n\n\nThat is not the law\n\n\nThat is contrary to the law and not touched upon by the Secretary of Justice\n\n<$C> \n\nYes I agree with you on on that point uh Mr President that that the DECS uh the Secretary uh overstepped uh his uh prerogative uh under under the law because uh he exempted again he fixed the rate uh and established a certain ceiling\n\n<$A> \n\nCeiling", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nThank you Mr President\n\n<$A> \n\nThank you\n\n<$B> \n\nSenator Romulo, \n\n<$D> \n\nWell Mr  uh Mr President would the distinguished uh gentleman uh yield to a few questions\n\n<$A> \n\nWillingly uh Mr President to the distinguished Chairman of the Committee on Banks\n\n<$D> \n\nWell Mr President uh uh as Senator Osme&ntilde;a said that was uh precisely the point that I wanted to bring up too \n\n That whereas you had stated uh the monopoly and other practices uh being uh uh done or undertaken by Marina Seven R I think I heard about Metro and then as Senator Osme&ntilde;a stated in several other ports all over the Philippines both big and small uh what is the agency that is in-charge of all of this uh Mr President\n\n<$A> \n\nIt is the Philippine Ports Authority Your Honor uh which happens to have uh a board headed by the uh Secretary of Transportation, \n\n\nSo right now it is supposed to be headed by Secretary  Ben Castro ,   and  the Vice-Chairman of course is General Manager former or retired Commodore  Jaime Dancel  \n\n<$D> \n\n Who who   \n\n\nUh is uh Commodore  Dancel  still the General Manager at present\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yes Your Honor as far as I know\n\n<$D> \n\nUh has he not been the General Manager since uh at least nineteen eighty-eight\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yes Your Honor uh there have been uh I think uh three changes uh I think one time it was  Ceferino Aguas  then I think there was a  Calixto Santos  and if I 'm not mistaken after that Commodore  Dancel  came in\n\n<$D> \n\nSo Commodore  Dancel  because I think uh Capt  Santos  was during the previous administration so Commodore  Dancel  has been at the head not only in nineteen eighty-eight as I posed in my question but perhaps earlier if not eighty-six perhaps eighty-seven is that correct\n\n<$A> \n\nWell Your Honor uh based on the uh, lease agreement signed, in nineteen eighty-seven in nineteen eighty-six it was signed by  Ceferino Aguas   ,  I really don't know who   is it is in nineteen eighty-seven because the lease agreement was signed by the Chairman then  Minister of Transportation Hernando V Perez\n\n<$D> \n\n I see   \n\n\nI see\n\n\nWell at any rate Mr President uh the records of the case will show when in fact Commodore  Dancel  started as General Manager\n\n\nNow Mr President uh you mentioned that the Chairman is uh is uh the uh Secretary of Transportation but what I have heard because uh several groups have also approached me lately about this uh is that it is in fact a certain Jose  Bustamante  I don't know if he 's Undersecretary who is the Chairman\n\n\nNow again it 's uh it 's a matter of record but can you uh uh try to remember whether it 's in fact uh uh Undersecretary or whoever Jose  Bustamante  who is in fact the Chairman or whether if you say that it is the Secretary of Transportation perhaps then  Bustamante  sits or stands for him\n\n\nCan you tell us uh if you  ,  can remember what is the status of this Chairmanship \n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nYes Your Honor uh the Chairman is Secretary  Ben Castro  \n\n<$D> \n\nI see\n\n<$A> \n\nUh however most of the time  ,  Undersecretary  Bustamante  uh uh sits for him\n\n\nBut based on my information and again this has got to be uh confirmed or denied during the investigations uh probably part of the reason why Secretary  Castro  precisely has not sat on these meetings is that he as well as uh Mr Philip Tuazon of Marina there are two of them seem not to be in agreement with this particular uh extension\n\n\n  But it seems  that there are some people who are exerting representations let us not say pressure at this time for them to grant not only the ten years but the twenty-five-year extension\n\n<$D> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\n I see   \n\n\nOkay\n\n<$D> \n\nUh but in fact uh Mr President whether as Chairman or sitting for the Chairman who is the Secretary of Transportation in fact isn't it true that uh Mr Jose  Bustamante  has been the one sitting not only now that Secretary  Castro  has been appointed interim or acting but even before and so that uh the fact that Undersecretary  Bustamante  is there is only uh uh continuing what was the practice before uh  Ben Castro  took over as acting Secretary \n\n Is that not correct\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's probably the case Your Honor and at least in the last meeting last Thursday it was Undersecretary Jose  Bustamante  who presided\n\n<$D> \n\nNow Mr President uh in the case of the P P A uh under what department is the P P A connected Mr President\n\n<$A> \n\nIt is attached to the Department of Transportation and Communications\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd being attached to the Department of Transportation and Communication as in fact the Chairman is the Secretary <unclear> 1 word </unclear> or the Undersecretary of Transportation what is the scope of supervision monitoring authority etcetera of the Department of Transportation and Communication with said P P A and the actuations of P P A with these various uh entities that you had mentioned\n\n<$A> \n\nWell technically Your Honor it is not under the complete control of the Secretary of Transportation as Secretary but it is under the control of the uh P P A Board of which he happens to be Chairman\n\n\nSo uh it is more  uh more or less uh if you may use the word \" semi-autonomous \" \n\n\nBut still the Chairman being the Secretary of Transportation uh he should uh exercise uh almost uhm uh what we say absolute uh supervision over this particular matter\n\n\nNow the only problem here is and that 's why maybe uh it should be clarified in fairness to him why we brought in uh the name of Executive Secretary  Mario Carlos  is as you know  Ben Castro  is still an O I C\n\n\n Ben Castro  uh has not been submitted to the Commission on Appointments and the impression in the whole D O T C is that anything that happens in the D O T C still must have to be cleared with Executive Secretary  Mario Carlos  \n\n<$D> \n\nWell Mr President not only that but in point of fact uh the the items the juicy items that you have been mentioning did not only happen when uh Acting Secretary  Ben Castro  took over  \n\n Is that not correct\n\n\nOr are you saying that all of this that you have enumerated and detailed happened only starting from the time that uh Mr  Ben Castro  took over as acting Secretary\n\n\nCan you clarify\n\n<$A> \n\nNow you are correct Your Honor  the uh after uh Secretary Rainiero Reyes uh uh was able to successfully insist on awarding the uh contract for the M I C T to Razon after that Secretary   Carlos  came in as you know and uh at least I think in the OTSI case the Ocean Terminal Services Incorporated uh Secretary  Carlos  was uh already the Secretary\n\n\nNow in the case of Marina I 'm not quite sure whether it was still in the matter of the acquisition of Marina lately whether it was still  Carlos  or it was Acting Secretary Arturo Corona who as you know also was a proteg\u00e9 of Executive Secretary  Mario Carlos  \n\n<$D> \n\nUh so that what you are saying Mr President is that all of this did not only occur starting from the take over as O I C of uh Acting Secretary uh  is that most of this if not all of this occurred after the incumbency of Secretary Rainiero Reyes\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yes Your Honor except the original uh change of contract in eighty-seven which reflected more favorable terms to Seven R that occurred during the incumbency of Minister Hernando Perez before Secretary Reyes\n\n<$D> \n\nWell so  with those uh uh uh few exceptions all of this has occurred between the period after Secretary Reyes and the assumption of Acting Secretary  Ben Castro  \n\n<$A> \n\nYes Your Honor with one little uh uh modification \n\n \n\n<$D> \n\nUh but it has not been consummated yet\n\n<$A> \n\nNot yet Your Honor\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd as you 've stated uh  Ben Castro  does not even attend and in fact there is a continuity in the person of uh Undersecretary or Assistant Secretary or whatever his title is Jose  Bustamante  whose continuity starts from the time after uh uh Minister or Secretary Rainiero Reyes and the present acting incumbent \n\n correct\n\n<$A> \n\n That   that would be correct Your Honor\n\n<$D> \n\nWell Mr President this is very important because Mr President the \" unholy alliance \" that I don't know if you used that phrase did you use that phrase\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'm not sure now whether I did\n\n<$D> \n\nWell at any rate Mr President this is what the groups that have approached me lately uh have told me\n\n\nThis unholy alliance between the P P A and several of this uh well probably the word is not several but this monopoly of  arrastre  and stevedoring uh is a general perception in the pier Mr President\n\n\nAnd so this is nothing that is uh new Mr President\n\n\nUh are you aware of this that uh you know this is the general perception in the in the south and the north harbor that there is an unholy alliance between the P P A and these monopolies of  arrastre  and stevedoring \n\n Is that correct Mr President\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd uh that is correct Mr President and if I may add with uh uh there is a perception that there is a spin-off into certain smuggling operations and there is an unholy alliance at that point which includes officials of the Bureau of Customs\n\n<$D> \n\nYes Mr President\n\n\nAnd have you also been informed Mr President now of course uh uh this is up to us to invite but uh the  Lighterage  Association and the other users of the uh ports importers exporters shipping lines have in fact brought this to the attention of Secretary  Carlos  when he was still Secretary of Transportation and Communication\n\n\n are you aware of that or have you had that information from this group that they have in fact brought this to the information of Secretary  Carlos  not now but before yet in nineteen ninety and perhaps even before\n\n\nAre you aware of that\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'm not aware of that Your Honor and I 'm thankful that you have brought that up because uh uh this only uh strengthens uh the uh representations that we have made in our speech\n\n<$D> \n\nNow Mr President if this is so that it has been brought to the attention both of the P P A and the Secretary of Transportation by the importers the exporters the shipping lines the port owners uh the  Lighterage  Association and all of this uh do you believe therefore that since this was brought to their attention they could have done something about it not now but in nineteen ninety nineteen eighty-nine or nineteen eighty-eight\n\n<$A> \n\nUh that 's correct Your Honor and since they did not then it strengthens our uh assertion that it was because uh there are very powerful backers supporting this octopus at the piers\n\n<$D> \n\nWell the only reason why I have brought that up is because you have raised that question what role is the Executive Secretary formerly of the D O T C playing in the spinning of this monopolistic web why is D O T C O I C  Ben Castro  who is P P A Chairman so strangely silent on all these things \n\n\nSo that is the reason why I am bringing to your attention matters that have been brought to my attention by these groups\n\n<$A> \n\nThank you Your Honor\n\n<$D> \n\nSo uh but you you have not been informed about this Mr President   that this  has been brought directly to the attention of the higher ups specifically those that we have mentioned \n\n<$A> \n\nNo  Your Honor   \n\n\nNo Your Honor uh what has been brought to my attention is that uh Messrs Dizon Atayde Rocha and company have been name-dropping uh the name of Secretary  Carlos  and uh I understand there was one confrontation where uh Mr  Ben Castro  uh blew up and said uh uh you should not pressure me on this by name-dropping the the name of Secretary  Carlos  \n\n<$D> \n\nWell at any rate uh in the hearing of the Blue Ribbon Committee uh these various groups will be summoned should be summoned and I hope that under oath they will make the same statement that they have given to me Mr President at least as to the facts\n\n\nI am not saying that there is anybody in cahoots\n\n\nI 'm just saying that this has been brought to the attention of the higher ups and that up to now obviously because of this privilege speech nothing has yet been done\n\n\nOr has something been done Mr President\n\n<$A> \n\nNot that I know of uh Your   Honor as  I said uh the other uh development lately is they have started to try to take over the Ninoy Aquino International Airport cargo handling services and Senator Osme&ntilde;a 's brought out the fact that they are operating nationwide uh which I did not really mention in my speech\n\n<$D> \n\n I see   \n\n\nWell Mr President I have mentioned \" unholy alliance \" between the P P A and several of this group \n\n I think what you have mentioned is the tentacles of the octopus which is trying to extend uh not only within the north and south harbor but even beyond\n\n\nBut one other point Mr President uh in the case of the P P A are you aware of the twenty-seven million ghost drainage project\n\n<$A> \n\nUh no Your Honor I am not aware of that particular project\n\n<$D> \n\nWell uh I thought I would bring that up Mr President because this has also been the subject of uh a lot of complaint and representation by the  Lighterage  Association of the Philippines to the P P A and to the Chairman and the Secretary but again Mr President nothing has been done about this twenty-seven million uh ghost uh uh drainage project\n\n\nAnd Mr President uh we only have to establish that there is a twenty-seven million contract and the fact that the Pasig River that portion which has is supposed to be drained is still not drained and is still a hazard or an obstacle to shipping\n\n\nAnd nothing has been done about that in  fact in spite of the fact that this has been brought up in so many fora by the uh associations involved in this nothing has been done by the P P A\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I 'm glad that you brought that up Your Honor and uh therefore it should also be included within the scope of the investigation\n\n<$D> \n\nWell finally Mr President I think the tell-tale and the significant portion of all of this is as you said the Chairman or Secretary of Transportation exercises absolute supervision and authority and therefore therein hangs the tale Mr President\n\n\nThank you Mr President\n\n<$A> \n\nThank you uh Your Honor and I 'm certainly relieved that Senator Osme&ntilde;a gentleman from Cebu and you have added to my privilege speech because there is always a tendency on the part of these people to immediately deny it and charge that uh either I 'm lying or I have no basis\n\n\nAt least in this speech today uh two members of this uh chamber have immediately come forward to uh validate uh uh at least uh a substantial portion of our privilege speech",

representations with the Japanese government on a parliamentary level uh as suggested by Senator Lina is indeed uh worthwhile\n\n\nBut I 'm also thinking that the biggest uh investors in our country

branch offices of industrial and manufacturing giants in the United States and who have actually uh have uh great influence upon  order  upon their   government   ,  can also be uh made and uh without

the motion I would like to ask uh some questions also\n\n<$D> \n\nWith uh pleasure Mr President\n\n<$E> \n\nUh specifically on the point of  carageenan   \n\n<$D> \n\nYes Mr President\n\n<$E> \n\nMay we be advised, on uh  carageenan  as an industry export industry of our country\n\n\nWasn't there a time that uh somehow the Philippines was the principal source of  carageenan  uh in the world\n\n<$D> \n\nMr President uh not exactly of  carageenan  but of seaweeds\n\n<$E> \n\nCorrect\n\n<$D> \n\nYes\n\n<$E> \n\nUh in other words there was a time that the Philippines practically had a monopoly of seaweed for the purpose of making    carageenan   \n\n<$D> \n\n  Carageenan    \n\n\nThat 's correct Mr President yes\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd how is it that now uh we  uh uh  carageenan  or seaweed uh is  being uh barred by other countries\n\n\nDoes that mean those importing countries like the E E C E E C C uh have other sources of uh of seaweed\n\n<$D> \n\nYes uh Mr President there are now uh seaweeds from Indonesia from Thailand from uh Ireland   among other  nations\n\n<$E> \n\n  Pa'nong    \n\n\nPa'no hong nangyari 'yon  \n\n<$D> \n\n  Uh  \n\n<$E> \n\n  Wala   sila nung una\n\n\nTayo lang ang meron\n\n\nNgayon eh pati eh  Ireland as you said Indonesia  e meron na rin\n\n\nNaku kalaban na natin ka-kompetensya  \n\n<$D> \n\nUh  tulad siguro ng sikreto ng  atom bomb  'yan  Mr President\n\n\n Nung una Amerika lang ang may alam ngayon marami na   \n\n\nA country oh which produced uh  bangus  you know in a large scale and uh with uh with finesse\n\n\nBut now our  bangus  has uh been stolen by other countries to put it very bluntly and now several countries are growing  bangus  \n\n\nSo I suppose that uh the situation is much similar to what happened to  carageenan  \n\n<$E> \n\nMr President I had the privilege of visiting uh the principal or major uh uh producer of uh  carageenan  in the Philippines that is in Cebu\n\n<$D> \n\nYes\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd uh I learned uh in the course of my visit uh in the plant that uh there were exports of the Philippine variety the very good variety exclusive to the Philippines and uh exported by our countrymen Mr President some of our countrymen uh which to my mind is a very unpatriotic uh act\n\n\nNow is that uh do you know Mr uh President if uh this exporting practice of uh choice Philippine seaweed is still going on\n\n<$D> \n\nI I uh I would suppose so Mr President because there is no ban against such exportation and uh as I earlier mentioned uh Mr President even the export of  bangus  fry which is prohibited is being circumvented uh as you know very well Mr President so I will not be surprised if uh this is also being done insofar as uh Philippine uh seaweeds are concerned\n\n<$E> \n\nUh would you say that there is need to not only to enact legislation if there is no legislation to that effect uh prohibiting the export of uh choice Philippine seaweed that is the main source of  carageenan  \n\n\n Meron ho bang uh batas ngayon  \n\n<$D> \n\nUh that can be considered Mr President and uh for it is for this reason that probably it is best that this particular issue is really referred to the appropriate committees so that uh all these repercussions uh which which might uhm arise from our act on this issue can be studied thoroughly\n\n<$E> \n\nI understand I 'm just was just informed Mr President that our colleague in this chamber Senator Shahani has a bill prohibiting filed with this chamber prohibiting the exportation of uh fresh seaweeds\n\n\nI think uh we should have that calendared if possible and uh acted upon as one of the measures that this uh uh chamber should take with a view to alleviating the sad situation of uh confronting the  carageenan  uh industry of our country\n\n\nAnd then of course to be followed as suggested by the uh distinguished Senator from Mindanao of enforcing strictly whatever law we pass in this chamber\n\n\nNow uh coming now to to prawns\n\n<$D> \n\nYes uh Mr President, \n\n<$E> \n\nUh, apart from uh, this uh uh,   move  to or suggestion that we try to send a a parliamentary delegation to take up in  behalf of our countrymen engaged in the prawn industry uh do you think it would be a good idea, to open the door now, to foreign interest investors so that they may go  get into the prawn industry in our country\n\n<$D> \n\n Move   \n\n\nUhm Mr President I am not aware that uh it is prohibited of uh foreigners to do so even as of now uh particularly in joint ventures\n\n<$E> \n\n  Uh  \n\n<$D> \n\n I   my understanding is that it can be done\n\n<$E> \n\nIt can be done\n\n\nAnd would you go to the  because that is now it would seem allowed by the Foreign uh Investment Incentives Act  'no  \n\n<$D> \n\nBy uh by existing law yes and that 's my understanding Mr President\n\n<$E> \n\n Would you go to the extent of uh welcoming now foreign investment into this field where Filipinos are now engaged in\n\n<$D> \n\nUh that 's what I was trying to say Mr President there  there seems to be no law that uh prohibits this kind of uh participation by foreigners\n\n<$E> \n\nIn in other words Mr President my point is this\n\n\nHere uh the good Senator from Mindanao says that well we are behind in technology we cannot produce uh we don't have the equipment to produce uh copra that has very low content of uh   what  is that\n\n<$D> \n\n    \n\n\nAflatoxin\n\n<$E> \n\nWell whatever that is Mr President\n\n\nSo uh-huh we can uh the Foreign Incentives Act of our country that is now in the process of uh of uh  being firmed up between the two houses of Congress will now allow uh or  even encourage uh foreign investors to come in here engage in the same business so that well at least the Filipinos our countrymen who are employed in this uh industry may not be deprived of their means of livelihood\n\n\nUh would you,   consider  that\n\n<$D> \n\n  Ha    \n\n\nMr President I am supportive of the amendments that have been introduced to the Foreign Investments Act\n\n\nUh it does not mean however that simply because we are opening the doors a little bit wider to foreign investments in this country that necessarily this will result in the prejudice of our own people\n\n\nUh uh I 'm not quite sure whether I got the thrust of His Honor 's question but I would like to just establish that premise\n\n\nAnd therefore whatever uh foreign investments may be allowed as a result of our action here in the Senate I will support\n\n<$E> \n\nIn order to maintain our exports uh  export income in these particular industries like uh  carageenan  uh copra and prawns and shrimps\n\n<$D> \n\nUh, frankly Mr President I don't uh quite see the point uh you will allow foreigners to come in so so that we will maintain our\n\n<$E> \n\nWell Mr President uh very simple\n\n\nIf you bring in foreigners they will try to protect this industry that they are now involved in or probably control\n\n<$D> \n\nYeah\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd so being in uh foreigners maybe Japanese they will  be the ones to negotiate and make arrangements with their country to allow uh uh the exports continue exports of uh the the Philippines\n\n<$D> \n\nUh\n\n<$E> \n\nTo\n\n<$D> \n\nYes\n\n<$E> \n\nOf foreign markets\n\n<$D> \n\nYeah now I see the point\n\n\nThat that might be a good tactic to employ Mr President as long as we do so within the context of our laws and our Constitution\n\n\nCertainly\n\n<$E> \n\nYes because uh these are industries uh uh which the Filipinos are involved uh in and as a matter of fact are adequately supplying uh for export purposes particularly\n\n\nThe and we say that that should be a reserved territory for uh our countrymen but yet we have I understand forthcoming a transition period that would allow foreigners and probably this is if we must uh take the position that we will allow a transition period to for the foreigners to come in\n\n\nThen this should be directed towards that end although   I 'm not  convinced about the wisdom of that uh move Mr President because that would be to the great prejudice of our people uh at least those who have invested uh uh a great deal of money in these uh uh ventures\n\n<$D> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nUh  Mr President before His Honor will continue  let me just uh emphasize that insofar as Japan is concerned in this particular uh moment we are discussing the uh decision of the Japanese authorities to prohibit the entry of uh prawns and shrimps which have uh more than uh zero point one percent antibiotic content\n\n\nAnd uh we want to emphasize that very clearly because trading with Japan in prawns and shrimps last year amounted to one hundred twenty-five billion uh  million million I 'm sorry one hundred twenty-five million pesos  uh dollar dollars Mr President which uh really is a lot of money\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd uh one last point Mr President I 'm particularly intrigued by the statement of the uh good senator uh that uh the move of Japan to uh bar actually to bar Philippine exports , \n\n\nUh how would you draw that uh  make that deduction Mr President\n\n<$D> \n\nUh actually Mr President uh we can perhaps uhm uh just speculate that uhm  the Japanese will do everything uh within their powers to induce to induce if not to pressure our country to uhm accept the presence of the U S military bases within uh the next uh few years after the expiration of the Military Bases Treaty in uh nineteen ninety-one\n\n\nAnd uh primarily we can tie this up with the with the statements of the Japanese Prime Minister himself when he was here uh who did not uh find it uh you know out of uh protocol to say publicly that Japan is in favor of the maintenance of the U S bases in this country\n\n\nSo what I 'm saying Mr President that is this that it will not be above the Japanese to do everything to bring uh pressure to bear upon our decision-making process on the issue of the bases\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd that is what we would uh characterize Mr President as  realpolitik  meaning uh the harsh uh  hard realities of international politics\n\n\nDo you think we we should be able to anticipate those uh realities\n\n\nDo you think we  are in a position to resist such pressures\n\n<$D> \n\nI uh I really wonder Mr President because I am told that even Taiwan has been making unofficial uh shall we say sending unofficial uh messages uh to the effect that they would also wish to see the bases extended in this country and once the bases are extended in this country then probably we will be able to secure uh favorable uh loans\n\n<$E> \n\nAnd\n\n<$D> \n\nUh Mr President from   uh  \n\n<$E> \n\n And   probably even the E\n\n<$D> \n\nOther countries\n\n<$E> \n\nE E C pressure   is  tied up also with this uh U S military bases uh uh question\n\n<$D> \n\n Yeah   \n\n<$E> \n\nThank you very much, \n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$D> \n\nWe really cannot discount that Mr President", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source":

the defense of the Philippines not for its protection \n\n\nAnd uh it is I think largely in the interest of the other party\n\n\nAnd so much so that you find that you can derive this uh draw this conclusion from the wording that whenever there is an attack on these, uh military bases we 're supposed to come forward to defend them\n\n\nBut when it 's just the Philippines minus the military bases they just uh they are not required obligated to come  to the fore and help us\n\n\nThat 's unjust unfair\n\n<$A> \n\nNow Your Honor thank you for that answer uh and I agree with you that uh indeed uh these uh military bases uh, shorn of its uh mysticism and myth is nothing but a naked uh uh effort uh to project the uh imperial military power of uh the United States of America uh in this part of uh the world\n\n\nAnd so uh given this situation Your Honor my next question is this\n\n\nRight now there is a burden, continuing, obligatory burden imposed on the Philippines flowing from the uhm so-called Military Bases Agreement between the Philippines and the United States of America, \n\n\nOn the other hand Your Honor we are receiving quote compensation unquote from the United States of  America\n\n\nI uh placed it in quotation because uh oh we 're all aware of the fact that uh this is not really the kind of a compensation that we would want uh to categorize as such in uh the law of contracts because uh whereas the burden on us is immediate direct and operating, the so-called uh consideration or compensation which was from the United States to the Philippines is only based on best efforts\n\n\nDo you think Your Honor that given the risk, on us of getting involved in the quarrels of the United States with other countries, given the risk of possible uh uh use of our territories as a launching area for uh nuclear attack against other countries\n\n\nAnd uh I have here a statement from a well-known writer which says that uh U S forces are capable  to know  of nuclear strikes or Soviet homeland uh based or  home ported  in the regions in South Korea Japan the Philippines included it includes the Philippines\n\n\nGiven this Your Honor and given the possibility that we would be the object of attack because of this thing\n\n\nDo you think that the present compensation package or even the compensation package that the group of Secretary Manglapus uh is now uh asking the Americans to pay to us for the continuation of military the American military presence in the Philippines is commensurate to all the burdens and risks that we are assuming\n\n\nGiven also the fact that America could be a threat directly to our country and people\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh that question had long been answered uh by one of our great Filipino nationalists uh  Don  Claro  eme   Recto\n\n\nHis answer to that question is, you were actually putting these installing these military bases  which will be obviously loaded with nuclear weapons which will serve as magnet to attract, destructive weapons the same nuclear weapons the same type that will destroy not just that military base but even the entire country and the surrounding nations\n\n\nSo the question is simply this\n\n\nDo you think it is enough to receive money to count it by the billions in exchange for the danger of to the danger of existence survival of the Filipinos\n\n\nSimply the answer Mr President is a definite \" no \" it is not sufficient as a matter of fact it cannot even be considered, \n\n\n Hindi pwede 'yon, ano naman buhay na ang pinag-uusapan rito  \n\n\n'Cause even if even if the Soviet Union or shall we say North Korea were not an enemy of ours the mere fact that we have nuclear weapons here and the United States is involved and involvement of the United States that is not in our hands we cannot stop it prevent it\n\n\nAnd yet the minute that such a situation should arise we are in great mortal danger\n\n\n  So <unclear> word </unclear>  \n\n<$A> \n\n  Samakatuwid po   samakatuwid po sa inyong mahalagang ah kaisipan ay 'yang tinatawag natin na mga kasunduan pang-militar sa Amerika kasunduan ng ating bansa at ng Amerika tungkol sa ah seguridad kagaya nung tinatawag natin na  Mutual Defense Treaty  at ganoon din ang base kasunduan tungkol sa base militar ay mas mabigat na pinapasan ng ating bansa kaysa nakagagaan sa ating kalagayan bisang bilang isang bansa  \n\n<$B> \n\nThat is true Mr President\n\n\nUh I realize that so many of our people depend uh uh for their livelihood their source of income on the military bases near Clark Field uh Subic, but I think the larger interest is the entire nation, \n\n\nAnd our own countrymen who might be uh uh prejudiced by any removal by the removal by this this uh dismantling of military of U S military bases here should be able to understand that the larger interest the general welfare is the supreme factor to be considered in the resolution of such an issue posed by the Minority Leader now\n\n<$A> \n\n Kayo po ba ay naniniwala na sa ngayon ay may binubuo na koalisyon ang tatlong, malalaking ah bayan dito sa ah Asya ah ah dalawang bayan dito sa Asya at ah kasama ang Amerika at 'yan ay ang baka bayan ng Tsina  People 's Republic of China  at ganoon din ang Hapon\n\n\nEh 'yang koalisyon po na iyon ay  anti-Soviet coalition\n\n\n Kayo po ba ay naniniwala diyan  \n\n<$B> \n\n I understand Mr President that in the politics particularly in international politics uh anything is possible and that your enemies now may be your enemies tomorrow your friends before could you be your enemies now\n\n\nAnd so I think uh that uh coalition spoken of by the Minority Leader is  is certainly a possibility\n\n\nAs proved by history  totoo ho 'yan eh,  \n\n\nThe Soviet Union uh allied with the United States attended Yalta the Yalta meeting, against the Axis Powers including Japan and uh Italy and Germany\n\n\nAnd now  aba iba na  \n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause as stated by George Washington Mr President and before him Lord Chamberlain or no  Lord Palmerston  there are no permanent friends only permanent interests national interests  \n\n\nAnd so if it is in the interest of a particular country such as China U S and Japan to group together in a coalition for the purpose of presenting a solid front against a particular enemy rising enemy probable enemy, there 's nothing to stop them\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd so Your Honor uh if there 's uh that 's it if there is such uh an anti-Soviet coalition emerging between amongst the United States of America Japan and the People 's Republic of China, do you agree with the perception Your Honor that the Americans would like the continuation  \n\n<$B> \n\n the other uh objective or purpose because I cannot conceive of a military base Mr President nowadays in this age of uh advanced technology without military unconventional military weapons particularly nuclear weapons, which are becoming more uh sophisticated\n\n\nSo if there is if there are military bases foreign military bases anywhere in the world, there must be a reason for it and that is in order for purposes of defense to serve as the first line of defense and second as the forefront the vanguard for purposes of attack against a possible enemy in the event of war\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd so therefore if there be such a a coalition and uh the the uh our Philippine military bases uh our support for that coalition Your Honor uh given the fact that about thirty-five to forty percent of uh the I I C D M force and ballistic missile firing submarines of the Soviets are actually deployed in our  region of the world, \n\n\nAnd given the fact that uh there is uh a large strategic bomber capability stationed by the Soviets uh in that area in Siberia and  we are within range of these uh strategic bombers don't you think Your Honor that the danger is very clear\n\n\nThat if we continue the uh presence of American troops in these uh facilities that uh we could be involved in a confrontation that we may not want to be involved simply because uh we want uh uh some uh dollars and cents to shore up our bankrupt economy\n\n<$B> \n\nUh obviously Mr President\n\n\nAlthough I can understand the uh uh the need of the country for uh dollars for money I think there should be, if  there 's a wall  there that should stop us already we cannot cross because that would mean mortgaging our future our posterity our nationhood\n\n<$A> \n\nMr President uh uh I would like to continue the interpellation but I have uh a scheduled meeting with a distinguished visitor the uh Czechoslovakian Ambassador\n\n\nUh and I would like to uh ask permission to  stop my interpellation if there will be time I 'll continue Your Honor so that  I think there are others who would want to interpellate the distinguished uh gentleman\n\n\nThank you very much\n\n<$C> \n\nSenator Pimentel is recognized, \n\n<$D> \n\nActually Mr President just a a  very few points uh if His Honor will permit, \n\n\nUh is it uh correct to say that the Soviet Union is still considered an enemy of the United States   because it 's  \n\n<$B> \n\n Not that   uh it is not considered by the United States as an enemy but as a potential enemy and a continuing danger to its world leadership\n\n<$D> \n\nIn spite of the fact that uh in Eastern Europe uh there is already a uh a total overhaul of governments which used to be communists and have now become uh shall we say more democratically-oriented Mr President\n\n\nAnd even in the Soviet Union itself, uh have we ever seen uh the phenomenon that we are now witnessing in the Soviet Union where Yeltsin is openly challenging Gorbachev and there are demonstrations of miners calling for the resignation of uh Gorbachev himself   Mr President  \n\n<$B> \n\n I would agree   Mr President with the thinking and statement of the uh Senator from Mindanao that this threat from behind the  garden  is not as serious as it used to be\n\n\nDefinitely, \n\n\nI think that uh with that uh   glasnost  and  perestroika  and the agitation and open rebellion of the various component republics in the Soviet Union which show that it 's certainly lacking in strength to challenge the supremacy of other world powers such as the United States but I would also call attention to the fact that it is not simply a question of of power armed strength\n\n\nThere is a conflict of ideology\n\n\nThere is seems to be a conflict of ideology that cannot be reconciled even as they the two countries they have uh already uh shall we say ended practically their cold war confrontation\n\n<$D> \n\nThat is exactly what I would like to stress Mr President that uh the ideological division between the Soviet Union and the United States is disappearing if it has not already disappeared\n\n\nUh you see Your Honor for example uh Latvia Estonia and uh Lithuania which is part of the whole Soviet Union empire these three countries have openly said they are now uh independent countries\n\n\nNow Georgia which is another state in the Soviet Union is able to assert uh at least by announcements that they would also wish to be considered an independent Soviet uh Republic\n\n\nNow all these things would seem to me to indicate that the Soviet ideology which uh used to be the basis of the uhm uh confrontation cold war confrontation and sometimes breaking out in actual shooting war uh in the subaltern states of the U S and the and and the Soviet Union this ideological division does not seem to be there anymore

yourself\n\n<$B> \n\n Well Your Honor   that is that is what you are saying  you are making false promises   \n\n\nWell Your Honor I am a senator of the Philippines   \n\n\nBut let us go back Your Honor to specifics because these people have to eat Your Honor   people in Olongapo  \n\n<$A> \n\n Let 's uh   let 's take out the proposed treaty\n\n<$B> \n\n  No not  \n\n<$A> \n\n Can you   point to any provision there any provision in the proposed treaty which will show that these people whom you are now so concerned about, suddenly concerned about\n\n<$B> \n\nNo Your Honor I have been I

to these workers\n\n<$B> \n\nNo Your Honor precisely what I am saying   Your Honor  \n\n<$A> \n\nYour Honor  in fact   in fact if I remember right you had spoken strongly against this proposed treaty which we are now considering\n\n<$B> \n\nI never spoke against it Your Honor\n\n\nI was putting up   a <unclear> word </unclear> stand Your Honor  \n\n<$A> \n\n You were saying   you were saying that

the gentlemen on the floor please speak one after the other\n\n<$B> \n\nWell Your Honor it is the other gentleman who 's interrupting me\n\n\nI cannot finish my statements and he breaks in\n\n<$C> \n\n  Both gentlemen are being referred to  \n\n<$A> \n\n No no no <unclear> words </unclear>   to me with respect to that Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nYour Honor you were the one that were breaking in\n\n\nIn fact I have given you all the time\n\n\nI ask short questions and you give out kilometric answers trying to divert the issues Your Honor\n\n<$A> \n\nI take it that you do not like what I have been uh   saying  \n\n<$B> \n\n No   it 's not that I like or I do not like Your Honor\n\n\nBut I wish Your Honor would be more concise we are running out of time the Majority Leader is asking us to hurry up\n\n\nIt is the sponsor that is eating up time we are not even\n\n<$A> \n\nYour Honor you   haven't answered my question  \n\n<$D> \n\n May I ask for a short   suspension Mr President\n\n<$C> \n\nI suspend the session for one minute  \n\n<$A> \n\nBut uh I I believe that uh I said uh if uh our leaders in government uh could only be more uh creative and resourceful uh  they would be able to uh shorten that uh period or if not find other uh uh solutions uh to this uh temporary uh problem\n\n\nNow I would like to bring out the fact uh Mr President uh that uh under the proposed treaty uh there is nothing uh stated in the  in any of the provisions of this proposed treaty uh which uh mentions uh any specific or uh definite amount that uh would be given or that would be used to address this uh problem\n\n\nNow uh I would also like to point out Your Honor that uh, if you are looking for uh, for solutions uh that could be uh used to address this uh problem we have uh what uh we are paying to our uh foreign debt\n\n\nUh for this year Your Honor uh I think you will admit that we will be paying the amount of two billion eight hundred fifty million dollars for our foreign debt just for one year\n\n\nNow under this proposed treaty that uh you are now uh voting for, over a period of ten years over a period of ten years and assuming that uh what was stated in the Bush letter will uh materialize without any deduction what uh we will be receiving will be much less than what uh we will be paying for our foreign debt in one year\n\n\nBecause if we would add uh this together over a period of ten years the appropriated uh amount would come out to a total only of two billion one hundred seventy-eight million dollars\n\n<$B> \n\nCan I now continue Your Honor\n\n\nUh because you digress the issue to foreign debt we are   not dealing here  on foreign debt\n\n<$A> \n\n Well uh   \n\n<$B> \n\n  Your Honor  I am not finished\n\n<$A> \n\n No no no   \n\n<$B> \n\nI 've been very courteous in allowing you to speak lengthily on even irrelevant matters\n\n\nBut must Your Honor please we are not debating foreign debt here\n\n\nI think there 's unanimity in this session on foreign debt\n\n\nWe are  then what we 're talking about here is breakfast lunch and dinner for eighty thousand displaced workers\n\n\nAnd this treaty Your Honor if we were to ratify it would provide two point seven billion pesos of wages which these workers are now currently earning for them to buy their food\n\n\nSo we are not talking of the compensation for displacement\n\n\nWe are talking of continued employment Your Honor\n\n\nAnd that is what I 'm asking what replacement are you since you are the chief advocate here in the floor now on the rejection of the treaty what alternatives for the livelihood of eighty million beginning with day one  ha  \n\n\nNot plans \n\n\nYou know  yung panaginip ni ano'ng pangalan niyan  Abueva the likelihood of hair growing on his head is bigger than the likelihood of that plan being successful\n\n\nSo Your Honor let us not talk about those dreams of Abueva\n\n\nUh let us talk basic facts Your Honor breakfast lunch and dinner\n\n\nWhere are these people going to get their food the day they are laid off\n\n<$A> \n\nWell uh Your Honor uh I note that you are only looking at uh eighty thousand workers\n\n\nThose uh in Subic and those who are working in Clark and uh I don't know how many of these workers are uh or were directly hired and how many are contractual\n\n\nUh I I believe it 's uh much less than uh eighty thousand\n\n<$B> \n\nWell Your Honor\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'm not yet finished uh Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yes  sorry Your Honor\n\n<$A> \n\nYour apology is accepted\n\n\nUh, so I said you are uh just looking at these uh workers in these U S installations\n\n\nNow uh what uh we are uh looking at and what we are seeing is the greater number of our workers who are now unemployed as uh Senator uh Herrera had said that there are, at least four million workers now who are unemployed\n\n\nAnd he said that underemployed uh could reach even the number of nine million\n\n\nNow how can we limit our concern to just the workers that uh you have mentioned\n\n\nOf course we are as concerned as you are maybe you will not believe this but we are\n\n\nBut uh we have to look at the total picture\n\n\nAnd uh if we will allow the Americans another period of ten years to make use of of Subic then we are uh uh setting aside and not uh making use of the opportunities the the wonderful opportunities that are now present to us to convert this valuable piece of land\n\n\nAs I said in the studies that have been submitted if uh Subic uh uh  will be uh returned to us uh and uh we can start implementing the conversion plans for Subic where uh among the plans are to establish a maritime industrial complex a ship building ship maintenance ship repair facility uh transshipment center a container port\n\n\nUh we know that uh uh in Subic uh there are uh large areas for uh building spaces for storage spaces we know that there is a runway  there uh nine  nine thousand uh uh foot long\n\n\nSo Your Honor I I believe that uh if these uh conversion plans would already be implemented uh there can be no doubt that uh there will be more employment generated for our Filipino workers\n\n\nNot just the eighty thousand now let 's say who may be affected but much more than that\n\n\nNow uh, of course there is that gestation period that we have to pass through uh we cannot avoid uh that uh stage even if we were to start after uh ten years we still have to pass through that uh gestation period uh but I I as I have said uh the government uh can uh if only it has the political will can uh come out with the necessary measures to cushion the impact of this on on the workers\n\n\nUh  uh Taiwan I heard is uh uh interested in uh uh our uh uh workers uh I I recall uh Secretary Torres mentioning that uh uh that so many thousands of them uh uh would have an opportunity to to work at Taiwan\n\n\n there 's still the Middle East uh opportunities and uh I also would not want to think that the workers who would be affected would just stay uh at their uh homes and the and the and not do anything\n\n\nSo Your Honor as I said uh you may you may not have as much faith as I have in uh in uh the Filipino but I I believe that uh uh this is a problem that uh uh can be solved by us\n\n<$B> \n\nWell Your Honor I have faith in our people\n\n\nI would not have come back seven weeks after Ninoy was killed I would not be here\n\n\nI have faith Your Honor but I do not want the martyrdom of eighty thousand workers so that four million hopefully if Abueva 's plans materialize may be able to find jobs\n\n\nYour Honor besides I dispute the concept that you can employ four million unemployed people in Olongapo if that is converted\n\n\nBecause to begin with I doubt if you can put enterprises there that would employ four million that 's to start with\n\n\nNumber two I doubt whether we have the resources\n\n\nFour million people it costs three hundred thousand pesos of capital to employ one laborer\n\n\nSo four million people if somebody has a calculator multiply it by three hundred thousand I think it would be about a trillion pesos of resources which we do not have Your Honor\n\n\nAnd Your Honor again I say I 'm focusing on the immediate problem\n\n\nNow if we were to uh ratify this treaty and allow for a phase down a gradual transition no disruption would occur Your Honor\n\n\nThe people in Olongapo and I 'm only talking of Olongapo Your Honor I 'm not talking of unemployment in the rest of the country because I will get to that Your Honor\n\n\nI 'm not talking of the six hundred sixty thousand garment workers who stand you and I do not believe that the United States will be so unkind as to take away our garment quota and cause the hardship of six hundred sixty thousand but the risk is there Your Honor\n\n\nNow Your Honor you also speak of Taiwan and let me point out that the Chairman of our Committee on Labor Senator Herrera who is right here beside me has told me Your Honor that he has talked to the authorities in Taiwan three times\n\n\nAnd they have told him that our access to labor in Taiwan is conditional upon our recognition of Taiwan a repudiation of our one-China policy which of course is in the realm of foreign affairs and I would not want to bring that issue in because I promised the Majority Leader and the leadership that we have no intention of prolonging this discussion and that is why we want to limit ourselves to short answers and short questions\n\n\nNow Your Honor going back to the need to provide for employment of our eighty thousand base workers why is it Your Honor that you and your colleagues are so insistent on bringing upon difficulties even hardships hunger upon eighty thousand Filipinos in the interest you claim of employing four million although Your Honor I don't see the logic because when you repudiate this treaty on Monday as you are intent to because you have twelve votes and we only have eleven then we will trigger a an environment of apprehension among the foreign investors\n\n\nAgain you will say we are being threatened I think it is a reality because the truth of the matter Your Honor is that investors will not come here there are other places where they can invest\n\n\nAnd we have while other countries are creating environments for favorable foreign investments we seem to be intent on isolation in this country and repelling foreign investors", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3bcc995c-6dcd-4d40-9dd4-fd5c9882b93e", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\n the uh capability of the U S to recognize the document as a treaty must be in accordance with its procedures review of uh as of Fr Bernas that the only way for the United States to recognize the treaty is to have it ratified by their Senate I understand is subject to question because uh as I said there may be those around this very table who who might uh wish to say that there are other ways by which the President of the United States or the Executive Department may consider a document a treaty\n\n<$B> \n\nI have just two other questions on this point so that the others can also ask questions uh  Madame Chairperson\n\n\nUh, I would like to call the attention of the  Secretary to the preamble of the Treaty of Friendship Cooperation and Security so-called and in particular to the paragraph which states that the treaty is valid the treaty is valid under international law\n\n\nThat does this refer to the fact that the treaty is valid despite the fact that let 's say it is not going to be concurred in by the U S Senate, \n\n\nAnd the second question is if the Philippine Senate does get to concur with this bases treaty under this kind of a preamble Mr Secretary uh would that mean that the Senate the Philippine Senate in effect uh is made to accept the interpretation that the Constitution does not require U S Senate concurrence, \n\n<$A> \n\nUh I 'm I 'm looking at the preamble now uh Senator I 'm looking for that uh portion which you were referring to\n\n<$B> \n\nUh it is at the uh last uh paragraph   uh the first page  \n\n<$A> \n\n Shall provide a framework   \n\n<$B> \n\nIt says  recognizing that this agreement which constitutes a treaty under international law shall provide a framework for their continuing relationship and cooperation  \n\n\nNow uh uh would uh concurrence by the Philippine Senate mean acceptance of the interpretation that uh this would not have to be submitted to the U S Senate\n\n<$A> \n\nUh, I think that uh   while acceptance of that interpretation is an important step the uh the fact uh stands by itself and whether we accept it or not there is in the American jurisdiction a  situation where there are more than one ways of getting a document to be recognized as a treaty\n\n\nWhether we recognize it or not I think uh uh does not change the situation\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat I mean uh Mr Secretary is that if this Senate of ours concurs with this treaty does it not in effect adopt the interpretation that uh uh it would not this same treaty that it has concurred in need not be concurred in by the U S Senate\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat uh this uh the language of this uh preamble says that this agreement constitutes a treaty under international law\n\n\nIt is a requirement of uh of our own Constitution that this must be a treaty\n\n\nAnd therefore we 're  doing nothing but confirming the language of our Constitution that we the Republic of the Philippines must look to this document as a treaty\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd so in effect uh we are adopting the interpretation that uh you have given that uh this treaty need not be submitted to the U S Senate   for its concurrence  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh Senator   the act of ratification or recognition as a treaty uh does not antecede this treaty\n\n\nIt comes after this  the signing and ratification by the Senate\n\n\nTherefore I do not see that it has any effect at all on that matter\n\n<$B> \n\nThank you Madame Chairperson\n\n<$C> \n\nUh I see that some of our guests uh have arrived and the Chair proposes that the Senators uh address their questions to Secretary Manglapus uh after which we shall hear our uh panelists uh I understand Vice-President Laurel is arriving at uh eleven o'clock\n\n\nAnd after we have heard the panelists uh I believe the Senators can address uh questions to them\n\n\nUh Mr Secretary I 'd like to ask uh the question which I think has been of uh primary concern uh for the Senate\n\n\nThis concerns the nuclear provision and uh this appears in uhm  uh the supplementary agreement number two uh article four uh section twelve\n\n\nThe uh Philippine Constitution is quite clear about uh the uh prohibition of uh nuclear weapons on Philippine soil\n\n\nUh in your opinion uh uh is this treaty uh  in consistency in accordance with that provision in our Constitution\n\n<$A> \n\nYes uh Madame Chairperson uh indeed uh this uh provision is contained in the current agreement and is merely reproduced in the new treaty\n\n\nUh we believe that uh it uh uh conforms squarely with the letter and intent of the Constitutional provision uh on uhm nuclear weapons the Constitutional provision\n\n<$D> \n\nMadame Chairperson\n\n<$C> \n\nUh Senator Laurel\n\n<$D> \n\nI don't mean to intervene at this early stage but uh I would like to raise a question of procedure\n\n\nIn this uh committee hearing do we understand it that uh our resource persons including of course the Secretary of Foreign Affairs who just uh made uh a statement uh of his position and the position of the Government that he submitted to us the treaty for ratification for concurrence\n\n\nDo I take it that we will allow them to each and everyone of them to state their position to deliver their uh statements and then afterwards do we ask questions\n\n<$C> \n\nUh yes this is what I uh just said uhm Senator Laurel since uh Secretary Manglapus was the first uh there were just a few guests when we began and uh as head of the negotiating panel I thought he was a valuable person to uh open our discussions\n\n\nNow we are addressing uh questions to him\n\n\nBut in the uh interests of time and we are pressed uh for time I believe it was uh decided in our caucus that uh we invite uh we have uh today uh nine guests who have uh confirmed their attendance and uh as I said after we have uhm addressed our questions to uh Secretary Manglapus it is the suggestion of the Chair that uh we hear our panelists and after which uh we can address our individual questions uh   to them  \n\n<$D> \n\n Precisely   \n\n\nDo we understand it Madame Chairperson that uh we will allow every resource person to precisely finish with their statement to deliver their statement and we will at the end ask questions or after every each one of them has finished\n\n\nDo we have the prerogative and are we at liberty to ask questions  immediately  after they have finished each one of them\n\n<$C> \n\nWell I think we have the right uh to ask our panelists some questions\n\n\nBut time is of the essence I hope that uh this is appreciated\n\n\nWe have uh uh lined up a uh a a list of uh guests not only for today but uh until Friday\n\n\nAnd it is the intention of the Chair in accordance with the uh agreement which was reached at our caucus that uh we should uh listen to as many uh members uh invited as possible\n\n\nNow the uh the panelists are uhm uh submitting also their comments in writing so  there 's  that chance to do so\n\n\nBut if there are other suggestions uh uh which uh you would like to propose uh of course I would like to entertain them\n\n\nBut as I said it is uhm uhm important that uhm we hear the panelists then of course to address questions to them\n\n<$D> \n\nWell uh Madame Chairperson I see it here in this notice of hearing well that today September second will be devoted to the discussion of an overview of the overview uh of the treaty that is been has been submitted to us uh foreign policy and legal issues \n\n I for one would like to focus simply uh specifically today on the legal issues\n\n\nNow uh we also agreed if I remember right Madame Chairperson in our last uh meeting caucus that we would proceed in this manner \n\n The panel of the Executive Department will uh deliver their piece this sort of broad position on all these issues I take it\n\n\nIn other words we are submitting like this they are submitting this treaty for  concurrence of the Senate because we believe it 's constitutional and legal\n\n\nThen we have then I suppose they should focus on certain provisions or items that will involve the issue of constitutionality and justify constitutionality in the course of their uh exposition\n\n\nThen it would be known as now this panel in the Senate to ask specific questions sort of after the <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nThat would expedite and I would like to state I was informed uh I suggested that procedure of raising first and discussing the constitutional and legal questions because I did not see any logic in discussing other items like compensation criminal jurisdiction  etcetera   \n\n<$C> \n\nUh thank you well thank you for your suggestions but I think the uh this was discussed in the uh caucus and I believe the uh Chair uhm is interpreting the uh suggestions of uh my colleagues\n\n\nI think the I would like to allow Secretary Manglapus to uh finish this question on uh the nuclear provision that is a constitutional uh question\n\n\nAnd uh then I suggest that uh we hear all of our guests uh who are here this uh uh afternoon\n\n\nAnd I don't see how you can just say pro and anti I mean I think we might be uh we might be uh prejudging\n\n\nAnd I would like to appeal to my colleagues that in the interests of time uh we proceed as the Chairman has decided\n\n\nSecretary   Manglapus  \n\n<$D> \n\n Well uh uh   in that case Madame Chairperson uh uh just for the information of the body here uh \n\n uh one particular person or official in government panel uh that will deliver his paper or his statement on the issue of constitutionality\n\n\nBecause if there is none then what will happen probably is that uh after various statements made uh by the members of the Executive panel the Executive Department we 'll ask probably some questions or similar questions which will take more time\n\n<$C> \n\nI would like to assure my dear colleague uh Senator Laurel that I have anticipated this\n\n\nAs you can see the members of the negotiating panel the technical staff are sitting behind Secretary Manglapus\n\n\nUh there is Assistant Secretary De Castro who uh will uh address uh herself uh to the uh uh constitutional issues uh as well as the uh status of the forces uh agreement\n\n\nUh there is uh Undersecretary Gaces uh who will be answering questions on the  \n\n<$C> \n\nWell I would like to say that Senator uh Tamano did uh give me a uhm a written statement and I think that uh this should be taken also as an indication of a desire to   speak  \n\n<$E> \n\n <unclear> words </unclear>   members of the Senate including this uh to write their uh uh request to be recognized by the Chair\n\n\nI thought that this is an open public deliberation\n\n<$C> \n\nMr President I think that this is uh common practice the Committee meetings that uh we send an indication that uh you would wish to speak either in writing or uh by uhm taking uh the floor Mr President\n\n\nAnd uh I did uh indicate to Senator   <unclear> word </unclear>  \n\n<$E> \n\n <unclear> words </unclear>   and I preceded the gentleman from Mindanao and I 'm just going to ask one question\n\n<$C> \n\nThe Chair has the power to recognize uh the members of uh the speakers and uh I would like to exercise this prerogative of the Chair\n\n\nUh Secretary Manglapus if you could please finish uh answering the uh questions  \n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> that the United States may absorb or resolve uh nuclear weapons in Philippine territory without agreement of the Philippines we believe confirms it conforms to this policy\n\n\nAnd there is the the guiding principle that the application of this ban on nuclear weapons must conform with the national interest\n\n\nI think the words are \" consistent with the national interest \" \n\n\nAnd we believe it is sufficiently consistent with the national interest that we should say \" no nuclear weapons unless agreed upon by the Philippines \" \n\n\nFurthermore uh there is a the second part of the provision uh Madame Chairperson regarding the uh exemption of visits and uh passage of ships uh is supported also by the statement made by Commissioner Ascuna uh where he says  as practiced both in Latin America as well as by the South Pacific countries that endorsed the treaty of Ara Tonga passage of ships whether nuclear powered or nuclear arms-bearing is left to the determination of every state on a case to case basis  \n\n<$C> \n\nUh I suppose the U S uh government will insist on a policy of neither to confirm or deny the presence of uh nuclear weapons\n\n\nWhat then is our reply\n\n<$A> \n\nThe policy that neither confirms or denies is a universal policy practiced by the United States\n\n\nUh we 're told that they are they have they 're forced to practice it so does not to so as not to reveal uh the uh location of their weaponry to a potential uh enemy\n\n\nUhm it is not uh something that is applied only uh to their relations with the Philippines\n\n\nBut uh we uh we have the option if we are asked for permission that uh we refuse that permission for storage or installation \n\n<$C> \n\nBut we don't have the capability uh to verify the existence of uh nuclear weapons   so what  \n\n<$A> \n\n We are developing   that capability\n\n Our Department of National Defense tells us that the capability full capability has not been reached but that in the modernization program of the Armed Forces of the Philippines we shall achieve that capability\n\n<$C> \n\nThank you", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

vigorous objection to these uh questions because they are not covered by any of the Articles of Impeachment\n\n<#79:1:C>\nThey are objected to for being immaterial and irrelevant Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$A> <#80:1:A>\nWhat 's the response of counsel for the prosecution\n\n<$B> <#81:1:B>\nMr Chief Justice I think that has been ruled upon by the\n\n<$A> <#82:1:A>\nYes I I beg your pardon Your Honor\n\n<$B> <#83:1:B>\nI think Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$A> <#84:1:A>\nNow we have agreed already on who will be the examining counsel\n\n<$B> <#85:1:B>\nOh no I thought that the\n\n<$A> <#86:1:A>\nAnd the assisting examining counsel\n\n<$B> <#87:1:B>\nI thought that it has something to do with the articles\n\n<$A> <#88:1:A>\nI think it should be the examining counsel who must respond pursuant to the agreement\n\n<$E> <#89:1:E>\nI respectfully disagree Your Honor\n\n<#90:1:E>\nFirst of all the evidence that will be presented through Mrs Ocampo as I said in the formal offer will show that the President and Jeso Jose Velarde are the same\n\n<#91:1:E>\nThe amounts that are involved in the accounts are very very substantial far more than the declaration of assets and liabilities which were submitted by the President\n\n<#92:1:E>\nWe submit Your Honor that by showing that the sums involved in these accounts are very large  that in itself is indicative that the President committed violations of the Anti-Graft Law\n\n<#93:1:E>\nHe has ill-gotten unexplained wealth and that is covered by Article two of the complaint\n\n<$A> <#94:1:A>\nAtty Flaminiano\n\n<$C> <#95:1:C>\nMr Chief Justice, the charge in Article two of the Articles of Impeachment reads as follows  President Joseph E Estrada violated the Constitution and stands guilty of graft and corruption when he directly or indirectly requested or received for his personal benefit one hundred thirty million pesos out of the two hundred million released by Secretary Benjamin Diokno of the Department of Budget and Management allocated under Republic Act seventy-one seventy-one in violation of Section three C of R A three zero one nine as may be seen from the affidavit of Luis C Singson Provincial Governor of Ilocos Sur dated twenty-five September two thousand Annex B hereof  \n\n<#96:1:C>\nNow the next paragraph reads  President Joseph E Estrada violated the Constitution and stands guilty of graft and corruption when he participated directly in the real estate business through a family-controlled corporation which constructed thirty-six town houses in Vermont Park Executive Village Antipolo City as shown in the P C I J in the article on President Estrada 's family and financial interest\n\n<#97:1:C>\n He also violated the Anti-Graft Law he is sworn to uphold\n\n<#98:1:C>\nHe filed his Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the year nineteen ninety-nine stating therein that he and his wife and children have business interests in only the three corporations\n\n<#99:1:C>\nThe President by that sworn statement also committed perjury and the offense of unexplained wealth because records show that he and his his wife and mistresses and their children have other interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities Annex E hereof   \n\n<#100:1:C>\nThere is nothing in this charge under Article two of the Articles of Impeachment which mentions this so-called five hundred million peso transaction Your Honor\n\n<$A> <#101:1:A>\nAnd for the just for the guidance of Atty Bautista\n\n<$E> <#102:1:E>\nYes Your Honor\n\n<$A> <#103:1:A>\nUnder the preliminary conference order on uh the issues agreed upon by the parties\n\n<#104:1:A>\nThe parties agreed that insofar as Article two of the Articles of Impeachment is concerned the only issue is this whether on the basis of the facts alleged therein the President could be guilty of graft and corruption\n\n<#105:1:A>\nHow would you be able to relate that kind of testimony to the agreement as to the issue involved\n\n<$E> <#106:1:E>\nAs I said Your Honor the complaint already alleges the ultimate facts constituting the offense\n\n<#107:1:E>\nThe statement here  He also violated the Anti-Graft Law he is sworn to uphold  \n\n<#108:1:E>\nThe fact that five hundred million pesos will be presented in evidence today as belonging to the President among other large sums as I earlier mentioned\n\n<$A> <#109:1:A>\nThe the the question of the uh Presiding Officer is uh whether or not uh that kind of evidence that you seek to introduce now would really relate to what the parties had agreed as the issue under Article two and I repeat whether on the basis of the facts alleged therein the President could be guilty of graft and corruption\n\n<$E> <#110:1:E>\nMost definitely Your Honor\n\n<$C> <#111:1:C>\nMr Chief Justice\n\n<$A> <#112:1:A>\nAtty Flaminiano\n\n<$C> <#113:1:C>\nThere is an allegation that uh there was a transaction involving five hundred million pesos\n\n<#114:1:C>\nNow there is no allegation of an  ultimate fact regarding this five hundred million pesos Your Honor\n\n<#115:1:C>\nEven if we read the Articles of Impeachment several times as we have done before we cannot find any specific allegation that will support the conclusion that uh this five hundred million pesos is part of what has been alleged in the Articles of Impeachment\n\n<$E> <#116:1:E>\nWe   submit  \n\n<$C> <#117:1:C>\n It speaks   of five hundred million pesos in cash whereas in these Articles of Impeachment Your Honor the allegation is that,  the President his wife and mistresses have other assets in other companies outside of the three firms listed in the uh Statement of Assets and Liabilities  \n\n<#118:1:C>\nThat definitely Your Honor is outside the scope of these allegations in these Articles of Impeachment\n\n<$E> <#119:1:E>\nYour Honor please it is settled that allegations which are evidentiary in nature need not be alleged as ultimate facts in the complaint\n\n<$C> <#120:1:C>\nIn the\n\n<$E> <#121:1:E>\nIn the matter of\n\n<$C> <#122:1:C>\nI 'm sorry uhm\n\n<$E> <#123:1:E>\nFive hundred million pesos being owned by the President is not an ultimate fact\n\n<#124:1:E>\nIt is an evidentiary fact which will tend to prove that the President violated the Anti-Graft Law\n\n<#125:1:E>\nThe ultimate fact that is material is the one I just read \" he also violated the Anti-Graft Law \" \n\n<#127:1:E>\nHow did he violate the Anti-Graft Law Mrs Ocampo will tell us\n\n<$C> <#128:1:C>\nIf Your Honor please the allegation that the President violated the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act is a conclusion of law \n\n<#129:1:C>\nIt is not a statement of an ultimate fact\n\n<$E> <#130:1:E>\nI disagree Your Honor\n\n<$A> <#131:1:A>\nUh uh the Chair would rule that uh while it may be a conclusion of law it is precisely a conclusion which could be developed only out of proof by facts\n\n<#132:1:A>\nBut the only issue really is how could you relate that to the ultimate facts alleged under Article two\n\n<#133:1:A>\nUnless you can satisfy the mind of the Presiding Officer on a particular relation between that ultimate fact and what you claim to be evidentiary on the basis of what the parties had agreed as the sole issue under Article two then I don't think uh the Presiding Officer may be able to clearly clarify its own position on the matter, \n\n<#134:1:A>\nIn short show to the court the relationship  ,  by by stating by by showing exactly facts which we may be able to elicit from the witness \n\nIf at all  ,  it has some kind of materiality to the issue agreed upon after the preliminary conference and during as a matter of fact   that conference  \n\n<$E> <#135:1:E>\n Thank you Your Honor   \n\n<#137:1:E>\n Yes   \n\n<$C> <#139:1:C>\n Mr Chief Justice   may I kindly point out that apparently the private prosecutor was not aware of what has been agreed upon previously\n\n<#140:1:C>\nHe might be completely unaware of the parameters of what has been agreed upon in order to expedite the trial of these cases where the issues have been specifically delimited in the pre-trial conferences Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$A> <#141:1:A>\nOne one simple question in relation to that uh is the examining was the examining prosecutor present during the preliminary conference\n\n<$E> <#142:1:E>\nYour Honor please before yesterday I was a passive spectator to this I haven't had sleep for twenty-four hours\n\n<#143:1:E>\nI definitely have no information or knowledge of what was agreed upon\n\n<$A> <#144:1:A>\nOf what has been agreed upon  ,  during preliminary conference\n\n<$E> <#145:1:E>\n Yes Your Honor   \n\n<#147:1:E>\nYes and uh\n\n<$A> <#148:1:A>\nWould would you need time to to confer with uh the panel of prosecutors\n\n<#149:1:A>\nBecause indeed uh indeed parties should be bound by what they have agreed upon unless you could really justify how you would proceed on this witness to establish by evidence its relationship to the issue agreed upon\n\n<$E> <#150:1:E>\nWe will try to prove Your Honor through the witness that the President had accumulated unexplained wealth and this is indicated with the amounts in the accounts Your Honor\n\n<$A> <#151:1:A>\nBut uh there had been uh the the defense had read into the record the allegations precisely under Article two\n\n<#152:1:A>\nSo if uh were you aware of uh the allegations under Article two\n\n<$E> <#153:1:E>\nAre you referring to the allegations on page five\n\n<$A> <#154:1:A>\nYes the allegations of ultimate facts under Article two  ,  so you could be properly guided\n\n<$E> <#155:1:E>\n Yes Your Honor   \n\n<#157:1:E>\nYes Your Honor", "subdomain":

\n\nThank you Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nAs a matter of fact uh the Presiding Officer also suggest that uh it would be the defense which should be immediately provided with the copies since during the

defense counsel Daza\n\n<$H> \n\nUh yes Your Honor I I will just bring it to the attention of the uh assisting counsel\n\n<$B> \n\nYes uh, Atty Flaminiano or Atty Versola\n\n<$E> \n\nUh this is exactly the same copy except uhm I have marked the exhibits because I have a separate folder\n\n\nYes Sir\n\n<$G> \n\nYour Honor we were furnished a copy of Exhibit L L L but what Atty uh Daza noticed is that while the witness was making the answers she was reading from a document which is not this one which is not a copy of this one\n\n\nShe was reading from another document which is quite confusing to us because we were following her statements\n\n\nSo may we request that the witness be cautioned to use only the copy of our own Exhibit L L L\n\n<$B> \n\nThat should be addressed to counsel for the prosecution to be fair to the defense\n\n\n  But  better yet for the defense especially for the assisting counsel to be there near the witness so the time that the document is presented you can see the document\n\n<$C> \n\n Thank you   \n\n Thank you Your Honor\n\n\nLet let me explain because all these bunches of documents could be confusing Your Honor\n\n\nThe markings are

defense can also be on guard against any surprise \n\n<$I> \n\nMr Chief Justice\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Majority Leader in the meantime is recognized \n\n<$I> \n\nMr Chief Justice to allow the parties to thresh this point better perhaps uh a twenty-minute break would be in order\n\n<$B> \n\nTwenty minutes would be given to the parties to thresh out uh the matter uh so we shall have a break uh for twenty minutes  <\n\n<$C> \n\nNow uh Your Honors uh I 'd like to manifest that the originals originals of all these documents that the witness has carried have all been in her possession and uh these have not been turned over yet uh Mr Chief Justice\n\n\nHowever we will be comparing these originals with the photocopies which have been pre-marked already\n\n\nNow for instance uh\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat what were uh uh pre-marked\n\n<$C> \n\nThe pre-marked documents\n\n<$B> \n\nNot the original documents\n\n<$C> \n\nNot the original documents Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nBut the pre-marking was uh done in

Honor I 'd be willing to do that Your Honor however these documents are not arranged uh chronologically\n\n\nLet me tell the Your Honors please that uh the witness had earlier prepared these documents and arranged them uh in in the order that uh she had deemed fit\n\n\nAs I went over these documents I realized that perhaps a better approach would be to indicate the deposits and then the withdrawals\n\n\nAnd in so doing uh Your Honor uh there would be a uh we would be jumping from one annex to another uh but we can go we can approach that on a per document basis if the court wishes",

wouldn't answer for the witness\n\n<$A> \n\nJust go ahead please\n\n<$C> \n\nI am not answering for the witness\n\n\nI 'm just saying that he has answered it earlier Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\n  No but that was before not now  \n\n<$A> \n\n There was a ruling already   \n\n\nThere is no need for you to debate on that issue\n\n<$D> \n\nYour Honor this is the report that was submitted by the Compliance and Surveillance Group to the S E C which was handed to my office through my secretary\n\n\nAnd when I was informed about it this is the report that I referred immediately to the Prosecution and Enforcement Department but I never had a chance to go over and read this report Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nBut you saw the report\n\n<$D> \n\nI I saw the well this page Your Honor I I see I remember very distinctly\n\n<$B> \n\nAll right, \n\n\nNow this page as I read to you has a date February eleven two thousand\n\n\nNow my question is that, previously, I recalled to you that, the Securities and Exchange Commission, was brought back to the supervision of the Department of Finance per Executive Order one nine two on January seven two thousand\n\n\nMy question is that isn't it a fact that when this report Exhibit seven M 's was brought to your office on February on or about February eleven two thousand that  that Order was already in effect in the sense that the S E C had already been brought back to the supervision of the Department of Finance no longer under the Office of the President\n\n\nIs that is that correct\n\n<$D> \n\nUh that is correct Your Honor\n\n\nNow I recall uh I remember that just before uh I was suspended uh the Securities and Exchange Commission was then also under and and I 'm referring to the first preventive suspension was then under the Department of Finance but uh this was uh brought back to the Office of the President and then in January of the year two thousand this was brought back to the uh Department of Finance\n\n\nThat is your that is correct Your Honor\n\n\nSo in January of two thousand for your question we were already under the Department of Finance\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd at the time the report was brought to your office you were already back under the Department of Finance because this was on February eleven two thousand couple of weeks after the Executive Order\n\n<$D> \n\nWhile this report was is dated February eleven two thousand it was actually received by my office in the afternoon about five o 'clock of February twelve two thousand Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd at that time the Securities and Exchange Commission had already been brought back to the supervision of the Department of Finance\n\n<$D> \n\nThat is correct Your Honor if you say that the Executive Order and I have no doubt to I have no reason to doubt you it was issued on January of the year two thousand\n\n<$B> \n\nTo whom did you refer the report Exhibit seven M 's after it was brought to your office on February twelve two thousand\n\n<$D> \n\nI referred this to the head of the Prosecution and Enforcement Department which at that time was in the person of Atty Ruben Ladia\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom the time that  you referred Exhibit seven M 's to Atty Ladia until, your resignation took effect on March twenty-six of that year did you have any occasion to discuss the report with him\n\n<$D> \n\nNo Your Honor I never had the occasion to discuss this report   with  Atty Ladia\n\n<$B> \n\n Did you   not take the initiative to inquire from Atty Ladia on what he did with the report considering that during at least about six weeks after you got the report the report was with him\n\n<$D> \n\nNo Your Honor because at that time the Commission  en banc  uh had required Atty Ladia to regularly make a report on its investigation of this B W transaction on a weekly basis every time that we met in our regular meetings of the Commission  en banc  \n\n\nSo I I I had not even uh discussed this report or followed it up or taken the initiative as you mentioned with respect to this matter as regards Atty Ladia Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nDid you not previously testify that  his department the P E D as you called it was one and the only one department that worked under your supervision and that you directly had authority and supervision over the P E D\n\n\nDid you testify to that effect\n\n<$D> \n\nI testified uh Your Honor to the effect that at that time I was the supervising commissioner of the Prosecution and Enforcement Department \n\n\nBut because under the law the Commission  en banc  also has supervision over uh uh the the departments of the S E C on the basis of the exercise of its supervision every department not only the P E D were required to submit weekly reports to the S E C Commission  en banc  every time that the Commission  en banc  met with respect to their area of responsibilities Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nAs supervising commissioner did you not think it did you not consider it fit to have a copy of that report or copy of the weekly reports furnished you by Atty Ladia\n\n<$D> \n\nNo Your Honor\n\n\nOn the contrary I felt that I should not really be dictating upon what the uh uh P E D should be doing with respect to uh this report because they know uh what they are supposed to do\n\n\nThe rules and regulations and procedure of the S E C is very explicit on the matter\n\n<$B> \n\nNo I was not asking you as to whether you dictated or influenced the P E D\n\n\nMy only question Chairman is whether as supervising commissioner you asked a copy of the weekly reports that P E D was supposed to make to the Commission  en banc  \n\n\nDid you ask for a copy\n\n<$D> \n\nOh yes Your Honor we were furnished copies of the weekly reports of the S E of the P E D with respect to their investigation on B W shares but it was not uh uh a copy of reports based on this\n\n\nIt was a copy of reports of the progress on the status of their investigation on their own on the B W matter Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nDuring during your direct testimony if I recall correctly  you said that the Philippine Stock Exchange as all exchanges under P D nine oh two A falls under the jurisdiction of the SEC \n\n\nDid I, recall correctly\n\n<$D> \n\nYes Your Honor under the uh Revised Securities Act which was the law then enforced the S E C regulated the entire securities market including the players in that market which also included all of the exchanges Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd the P S E, has had jurisdiction over the member brokers of the Exchange is that correct\n\n<$D> \n\nThe uh I I it 's not quite correct to end that way Your Honor\n\n\nWhat I am saying is that uh the Philippine Stock Exchange was given the authority by the S E C to have a first crack at investigating and policing and disciplining their own membership uh before the S E C takes over in the light of the new regulatory method that we put in place which is evolving that Exchange into a self-regulatory organization Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nNow when you said \" first crack \" what you mean is that uh before S E C would investigate P S E must first investigate\n\n<$D> \n\nOnly with respect to irregularities in the securities market involving stock brokers and dealers under their membership organization Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause uh P S E has no jurisdiction or authority over individual investors\n\n<$D> \n\nThat is correct Your Honor\n\n\nBut they have also limited jurisdiction over companies whose shares are listed in that exchange and they also have jurisdiction over them as well\n\n<$B> \n\nCompanies\n\n<$D> \n\nCompanies whose shares are listed yes\n\n<$B> \n\nBut not individual investors\n\n<$D> \n\nNo no\n\n<$B> \n\nDuring your tenure as uh Securities and Exchange Commission uh Associate Commissioner and later and especially when you were Chairman of the Commission the reputation you had was that uh you were open and transparent\n\n\nWas that uh reputation uh justified in your estimate\n\n<$D> \n\nI I 'm not aware of the reputation Your Honor but uh what I 'm aware of is is that it was under my term as Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission that I enforced another set of regulatory method which is precisely to make the securities market efficient transparent and fair\n\n\nAnd on that basis we made it the policy of the Commission to always require full disclosure with respect to matters that would be important to investors Your Honor so that they could make an intelligent decision on whether or not to invest in a particular stock\n\n<$B> \n\nRelated to that policy of uh transparency was your availability to media to being interviewed to being invited to uh press interviews \n\n\nWasn't that isn't that correct\n\n<$D> \n\nThat is correct although I recall Your Honor that at some instances the media had also criticized me for for clamping on certain information\n\n<$B> \n\nDo you recall that on January nineteen two thousand you were in the premises of the Philippine Stock Exchange\n\n<$D> \n\nYes Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nWhy\n\n<$D> \n\nI was there in the premises of the Philippine Stock Exchange on January of  of the year two thousand uh because at that time in the afternoon about two o 'clock the Senate Committee on Banks and Financial Institutions held one of their hearings in that premises uh in connection with its investigation of the B W transactions Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Committee on Banks Financial Institutions and Currencies uh at that time was chaired by Senator Raul Roco wasn't isn't it\n\n<$D> \n\nThat is correct Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nAs far as you can remember besides Senator Roco was there any other senator belonging to that Committee who was present at that hearing as you called it\n\n<$D> \n\nThere was no other senator at that time except Senator Roco Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nMr Chief Justice conformably to precedent uh in this court, and I believe I 've mentioned this earlier I would like to invoke judicial notice of the fact that a hearing was conducted by the Committee on Banks or a number of hearings was conducted by the Committee on Banks Financial Institutions and Currencies in regard to the B W shares\n\n\nAnd one of the hearings was as said by the witness on January nineteen two thousand at the uh P S E offices uh in Pasig City\n\n\nI would also ask that judicial notice be taken of the transcript or transcripts transcript or transcripts of the hearings before that Committee specifically that of January nineteen two thousand\n\n\nIn relation to that uh Mr Chief Justice, we have pre-marked as uh as , as Exhibit sixty-two for the defense a copy of that transcript and would request the distinguished prosecutors to consider stipulating as to this transcript marked Exhibit sixty-two sixty-two A sixty-two B sixty-two C and sixty-two D\n\n\nI 'm informed that copies have been provided the members of the Court as well as the prosecutor\n\n<$A> \n\nSixty-two\n\n<$B> \n\nWould the prosecutor agree to this particular exhibit in regard to existence execution and due authenticity\n\n<$C> \n\nOh yes Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nThank you, \n\n\nThese uh copies for the prosecution were attached to Exhibits sixty and sixty-one these being uh the next exhibit in series\n\n<$C> \n\n  What I have here Your Honor  \n\n<$B> \n\n May the prosecutor confirm   \n\n<$C> \n\nYeah excuse me yeah Your Honor\n\n\nWhat I have here is actually Exhibits sixty sixty dash E sixty dash B in series and then Exhibit sixty-one,

\n\n\nProsecutor Libarios your witness\n\n<$D> \n\nMr Mr Chief Justice Your Honors uh we are offering uh in evidence the testimony of this witness to establish and prove the following\n\n\nNumber one that some time in February nineteen ninety-nine the witness was called by the President to Malaca&ntilde;ang to discuss about the plan to set up a gambling casino in Clark\n\n\nNumber two that it was the President who introduced Governor Chavit Singson to Jesus Pineda for them to establish a casino in Fontana Resort known as the Fontainebleau\n\n\nNumber three that Jesus Pineda became involved with Governor Chavit Singson in the Fontainebleau gambling casino project at the instance of the President\n\n\nAnd number four that the President is the beneficial owner of the Fontainebleau a corporation organized and operated and funded from the proceeds of the  jueteng  collections\n\n\nNumber five that Fontainebleau entered into a lease agreement with Fontana Resort through its owner R N Development Corporation for the use of its convention center as the site of the proposed gambling casino\n\n\nNumber six that Fontainebleau transferred its assets which were actually acquired from  jueteng  collections and waived its right to operate a casino in favor of Fontana through the owner R N Development Corporation\n\n\nNumber seven that Charlie Atong Ang a known presidential crony brokered the deal between Fontainebleau and Fontana through its owner R N Development Corporation\n\n\nAnd number eight that Fontana Resort including the casino was eventually acquired by the President through Lucio Co a known presidential crony\n\n\nAnd we are further offering the testimony of this witness Your Honor to corroborate the previous testimony of Governor Chavit Singson and uh Carmencita Itchon that  jueteng  collections were used to fund the Fontainebleau project casino project and that the assets of Fontainebleau were later on transferred to Fontana and that Fontana was later on acquired by the President through Lucio Co\n\n<$A> \n\nThe witness is now yours \n\n uh Atty Mendoza\n\n<$E> \n\nMr Chief Justice may I inquire whether this evidence is being offered uh in connection with uh Article One first charge\n\n<$D> \n\nYes Your Honor it is in connection with Article One particularly the involvement of the President in the  jueteng  collections under Charge Number One\n\n<$E> \n\nThere are overtones in the offer that this evidence uh may have implications on Article Two\n\n\nI would like therefore to make it clear that this evidence uh is being offered uh solely and exclusively in connection with Article One of the charges\n\n<$D> \n\nMay I   have the  \n\n<$A> \n\n Do you agree   to that uh Prosecutor Libarios  ,  that is the testimony of this witness would be solely and exclusively for the Article One of the Articles of Impeachment \n\n<$D> \n\n Your Honor please this   \n\n\nYour Honor please I think uh it should be without prejudice to the possible adoption   by the prosecution  \n\n<$A> \n\n Later on   when you will call the witness just like in the case of Governor Singson then\n\n\nSo for the moment it would be exclusively and solely to prove Article One\n\n<$E> \n\nBecause uh we have this problem uh uh whether we could object to questions for example ownership of a certain asset uh not necessarily in connection with  jueteng  then later on the prosecution may say this is one of the assets which was not declared in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities which would be a charge under Article Two\n\n<$A> \n\nThen you can object to the question\n\n<$E> \n\n  So we we 'll have to object  \n\n<$A> \n\n And I think that the counsel counsel   for the prosecution should see to it that as promised by him the evidence to be elicited must only be for Article One\n\n<$D> \n\nWe agree uh Your Honor\n\n<$A> \n\nYou may now proceed\n\n<$D> \n\nUh thank you Mr Chief Justice \n\n\nMr uh Witness can you please uh state uh your name\n\n<$C> \n\nI am Rufo Colayco \n\n<$D> \n\nHow about your civil status are you married\n\n<$C> \n\nMarried\n\n<$D> \n\nYour address\n\n<$C> \n\nFourteenth Floor Sixty-Seven Sixty Ayala Avenue\n\n<$D> \n\nCan you also state your uh educational attainment\n\n<$C> \n\nI have a bachelor 's degree in History and Government from Ateneo and a Master of Business Administration from Harvard\n\n<$D> \n\nFor the record uh can you also uh tell us your professional background\n\n<$C> \n\nI was a partner in S G V and Company for thirteen years after which I was a partner in the Arthur Andersen regional office in Hong Kong for two years and thereafter for the next eight years I was the chief executive of the Kuok Group of Companies in the Philippines which are best known as the owners and operators of the Shangri-La Hotels and finally in nineteen ninety-eight I became the the president of Clark\n\n<$D> \n\nWhat do you mean by \" Clark \" \n\n<$C> \n\nThe Clark Development Corporation\n\n<$D> \n\nCan you tell us what is this Clark Development Corporation\n\n<$C> \n\nUh Clark Development Corporation is the uhm entity by which the government uh implemented its uh program to convert the former United States Air Force Base into a special economic zone and it continues to be the entity that administers that zone\n\n<$D> \n\nNow how did you become uh the president of Clark Development Corporation\n\n<$C> \n\nI was appointed the president of Clark Development Corporation in nineteen ninety-eight shortly after President Estrada took office\n\n<$D> \n\nNow as president of Clark Development Corporation can you tell us what was your primary duty or responsibility\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm as president of C D C or Clark Development Corporation my basic task was is to was to oversee the administration of the entire zone\n\n\nUh I I wish to note that an important aspect to that task was to deal with prospective investors to uh evaluate their suitability and ultimately to enter into agreements with them so that they could operate in the zone\n\n<$D> \n\nUh Mr Colayco do you know uh Governor Luis Chavit Singson\n\n<$C> \n\nYes I do\n\n<$D> \n\nHow did you come to know Governor uh Chavit Singson\n\n<$C> \n\nIn mid-February nineteen ninety-nine I was summoned by the President to Malaca&ntilde;ang for a meeting and uh when I arrived there at his office in the  Presidential Residence uh he was uh with uh Governor Chavit Singson\n\n\nHe introduced me to Governor Chavit Singson\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd uh what happened in that meeting in Malaca&ntilde;ang\n\n<$C> \n\nThe President started out by saying that uhm the governor had been extremely helpful during the past election and that he therefore felt it was appropriate to reciprocate\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd uh can you recall uh what did you take up during that meeting in Malaca&ntilde;ang\n\n<$C> \n\nYes the President wanted to discuss the uh proposed gambling casino project of uh that that was to be started in the Fontana resort in Clark\n\n\nAnd it was for that purpose that he wished to provide Governor Singson with a gambling casino license\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd what else uh did the President tell you if any\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah he also told me that he had introduced Governor Singson to Mr Jesus Pineda or Susing Pineda as he 's known to uh well who was connected with the uh Fontana Leisure Park\n\n\nHe said that he it was his desire that Governor Singson and Mr Pineda be partners in the gambling casino venture in Clark\n\n<$D> \n\nYou you mentioned about uh Fontana\n\n\nCan you please describe to us what is this Fontana and where it is located\n\n<$C> \n\nFontana you might say is the other major resort in Clark the the more famous and larger one being Mimosa\n\n\nBut Fontana is a two-hundred hectare uh resort which features uh sports and recreation facilities as well as residential villas\n\n<$D> \n\nNow at that time can you tell us the owner or operator of uh the Fontana resort\n\n<$C> \n\nAt that time the owner of the resort was Robin Tan and his family through a holding company called R N Development Corporation\n\n<$D> \n\nYou earlier said that uh in a meeting in Malaca&ntilde;ang the President mentioned to you the name of Jesus Pineda who was supposed to be the partner of uh Chavit Singson in that casino project\n\n\nDo you know this uh person Jesus Pineda\n\n<$C> \n\nYes I had known Susing Pineda for many years before that meeting and uhm I was aware that he was a classmate of the President a good friend of the President\n\n<$D> \n\nWhy do you know that he is a good friend this uh Pineda is a good friend of the President\n\n<$C> \n\nWell I I I had knowledge of that directly and in fact I recall that about the same time that I was appointed as president of Clark uh Susing Pineda was appointed as a director of the National Power Corporation\n\n\nAnd more recently I think in July of this year he was also appointed as a director of Clark Development Corporation and now serves as well as a member of the Executive Committee of the Company\n\n<$D> \n\nNow after that meeting uh in Malaca&ntilde;ang can you recall if you have uh a discussion with Susing Pineda or Jesus Pineda regarding the casino project\n\n<$C> \n\nWell of course he he we had to have meetings uh in order to implement the project\n\n<$E> \n\nUh Your Honor please at this point all of these testimonies appear to be immaterial\n\n\nMay I inquire whether at some point uh uh this testimony will be linked to  jueteng  collections\n\n<$A> \n\nI think counsel is just trying to lay the basis uh and uh the objection might be premature at this stage\n\n<$D> \n\nThis is only a preliminary Your Honor and uh the uh testimony of this witness now will be very very significant in the course of the proceedings Your Honor particularly in relation to the establishment of the uh Fontainebleau casino project which according to the previous testimonies was being funded through the use of  jueteng  collections\n\n<$A> \n\nSo the questions should lead toward that that objective to avoid any objection\n\n<$D> \n\nSo you uh you said you had a discussion with uh Jesus Pineda after the meeting in Malaca&ntilde;ang\n\n<$C> \n\n  Yes  \n\n<$D> \n\n Can you   please recall that\n\n<$C> \n\nWell we had certainly had more than one meeting\n\n\nWe met frequently in Clark Susing Pineda was more or less resident in in Fontana\n\n\nAnd so in the course of those many meetings uh well first of all he had he had told me that they were forming a corporation called uh Fontainebleau which was to implement the gambling casino project\n\n\nAnd that in fact the casino itself would bear the same name \" Fontainebleau \" \n\n<$D> \n\nAnd uh what else did you discuss if any\n\n<$C> \n\nUh yes I mentioned that we had frequent conversations and uh uh at a couple of those uh he disclosed to me that he had a serious misgiving and extreme discomfort about becoming the business partner of Governor Chavit Singson uh to the extent that I suggested to him that he ask his friend and classmate the President if it indeed was a requirement that for him to have a casino that he would be in partnership with the Governor\n\n<$E> \n\n  Your Honor  \n\n<$A> \n\n Atty Mendoza   \n\n<$E> \n\nMay I request that the witness answer only the questions directed and he does not make a narration because that would not enable us to make objections\n\n\nFor example many of the  much of the testimony of the witness is hearsay and we are unable to make an objection because the witness simply made a narration\n\n<$A> \n\nThe witness is advised to answer the question and not to make a narration of facts because that could anyway be elicited by succeeding questions\n\n<$C> \n\nYes   Your Honor  \n\n<$D> \n\n So so   what else happened after that\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm well he went to ask the President because he came back to me and said uh  Mukhang ano talagang kailangan kong maging partner si Chavit e yun ang gusto ng Presidente mag-partner kami  \n\n<$E> \n\nI move to strike out the answer is hearsay\n\n<$D> \n\nYour Honor please\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat must be the ground what 's the ground of the objection\n\n<$E> \n\nHearsay\n\n<$D> \n\nYour Honor please with all due respect uh the the testimony of   the witness is  \n\n<$A> \n\n The objection   is overruled\n\n\nIt cannot be hearsay insofar as the witness 's testimony is concerned because he was there\n\n<$E> \n\nUh this is in connection with what Mr Pineda told him as to what the President stated\n\n<$A> \n\nTo that part probably but not insofar as that portion in connection with which he was himself a participant\n\n<$E> \n\nYes Your Honor\n\n\nAs far as matters of his personal knowledge but not as far as to matters which he states were narrated to him by Mr Pineda as in regard conversations with the President\n\n<$D> \n\nCan I now proceed Your Honor\n\n<$A> \n\nYou must proceed\n\n<$D> \n\nNow aside from that meeting in Malaca&ntilde;ang with the President uhm where you discussed about the casino project did you have on any other occasion discuss also with the President the same casino project\n\n<$C> \n\nI can recall at least one other occasion\n\n<$D> \n\nWhen was that\n\n<$C> \n\nWhen uhm it was in June nineteen ninety-nine\n\n<$D> \n\nWhere\n\n<$C> \n\nIn Tokyo\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd uh why were you in Tokyo why were you in Tokyo at that time\n\n<$C> \n\nI was there because the President was there\n\n\nHe he was on a presidential visit to Tokyo and I took advantage as as it were of the occasion to promote Clark to Japanese investors by scheduling meetings with them in Tokyo during the time when the President was there\n\n\nI flew there separately but I was there at the same

Ejercito Luisa P \" which is not clear in all the copies uh all the photocopies of the original and only you have possession of the original\n\n\nWould you like to read for the record uh what these uh machine prints are\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay uhm it 's uhm \" With S H I G H Customer List \" \n\n\nIt stands for \" with Standing Hold Instruction Greenhills Customer List \" \n\n<$B> \n\n\" S H I \" means\n\n<$C> \n\nStanding Hold Instruction Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat do you mean by \" Standing Hold Instruction \" \n\n<$C> \n\nUh this is our own internal computer tagging system wherein uh an important client is tagged so that uh wherever he or she transacts in any branch would be given uh you know the proper recognition accommodation\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh the next line is uh if I may read \"  P H P eight million four hundred thousand \" \n\n\nThe next line uh reads uh book equal eleven million eight hundred ninety-five thousand one hundred thirty-two and seventeen centavos \n\n\n\" Avail \" the word \" avail \" is equals to three million four hundred ninety-five thousand one hundred thirty-eight and seventeen centavos\n\n\nIs that correct\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm yes Your Honor\n\n\nI also want to qualify that this is uh internal uh copy of the deposit slip\n\n\nThe customer copy does not contain the \" book \" or the \" available \" \n\n<$B> \n\nWhat do you mean by \" book \" and \" available \" \n\n<$C> \n\nUh the \" book balance \" is the one that is reflected wherein after a check deposit is made the customer cannot withdraw the money yet because the check has not cleared\n\n\nThe \" available balance \" is the one that the customer can withdraw at any point in time\n\n<$B> \n\nSo does it mean then that at the time the two Metro Bank checks were deposited the account had a had an available balance of three million four hundred ninety-five thousand one hundred thirty-eight and seventeen centavos\n\n<$C> \n\nYes Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nNow the account number in this exhibit septuple F is one six six eight two zero is that correct\n\n<$C> \n\nUh yes Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then in the box the name is uh account name is Luisa P Ejercito \n\n\nIs this correct\n\n<$C> \n\nYes Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nWho filled up uh this information uh Mr Witness\n\n<$C> \n\nAs far as we know uh it is the uh authorized representative of the First Lady\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then uh in the box at the bottom right side of the deposit slip Exhibit septuple F it reads \" for internal use only \" and then there are markings here\n\n\nUh would you like to read these markings for the information of this honorable court\n\n<$D> \n\nWe have to object to these questions Your Honor if the only purpose is to read the entries there\n\n<$A> \n\nThe objection is sustained there had been stipulation on the existence of the documents and the entries thereon\n\n\nWhat had been allowed by the Chair uh insofar as some of the questions are concerned would only be some kind of explanation\n\n<$B> \n\nYes Mr Chief Justice uh let me re-form then\n\n\nUh Mr Witness uh these handwritten uh words seem to read like \" with preclearance from \" the words the name is no longer legible\n\n\nWould you like to explain to this honorable court\n\n<$D> \n\nWe have the same objection Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$A> \n\nIt asked for an explanation\n\n\nWitness may answer\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay uhm I will read first the what 's written\n\n\nThere is a signature of the uh branch manager with a note \" with pre-clearance from \" our uh compliance officer Ian Fenton and there was a time indicated that around almost five o 'clock four fifty\n\n<$B> \n\nWho wrote this uh\n\n<$C> \n\nThe branch manager Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd his or her name is uh what\n\n<$C> \n\nUh Geraldine Nakpil\n\n<$B> \n\nSo these are the handwriting this is the handwriting of Geraldine Nakpil\n\n<$C> \n\nThis this is her handwriting Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay now uh who is Ian Fenton uh\n\n<$D> \n\nImmaterial Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$B> \n\nMr Chief Justice\n\n<$D> \n\nThese are the subject of stipulations\n\n<$B> \n\nNo Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$A> \n\nHe is only asking for who is the person\n\n\nAnswer\n\n<$C> \n\nUh Ian Fenton was the compliance officer at the time of the deposit Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm and by compliance officer you 're referring to an officer of the bank that makes sure that the laws applicable and pertaining to that bank are followed\n\n<$D> \n\nLeading Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$B> \n\nIs that correct\n\n<$A> \n\nSustained\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat do you mean by a \" compliance officer \" \n\n<$D> \n\nImmaterial this this\n\n<$A> \n\nSustained\n\n<$D> \n\nThey have no materiality Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$B> \n\nCould you tell this court uh what the duties are of Ian Fenton as compliance officer\n\n<$D> \n\nThe same objection Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$A> \n\nWitness may answer\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm Ian Fenton was acting as the compliance officer\n\n\nThe compliance officer makes sure that all the guidelines are followed all control processes are followed and uh the the transaction itself uh was done with the right procedures\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd by when you mentioned about guidelines you you refer to guidelines including those uh that apply with respect to accounts of substantial amount uh and or accounts maintained by politicians   or and  public officials and their spouses\n\n<$D> \n\n Leading   leading Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$A> \n\nSustained\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat are these guidelines uh Mr Witness\n\n<$D> \n\nWe believe these questions are immaterial Mr Chief Justice to the purpose of the offer\n\n<$A> \n\nLet 's see let 's see uh what would be the materiality later\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay uhm the guidelines Your Honor you see uh in the bank we establish thresholds for each customer  'no  \n\n\nDepending on the customer certain threshold amount that they deposit creates a trigger that we have to probe the nature of the deposit and the underlined transaction\n\n\nLike for example an ordinary individual we may set a trigger of let 's say five hundred thousand or one million while probably a businessman who is a big-time businessman we may even set limits of higher ten million or up\n\n\nSo depends on each individual we set triggers for uh monitoring\n\n<$B> \n\nDo you have thresholds for public officials\n\n<$D> \n\nImmaterial Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$A> \n\nSustained\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat thresholds if any do you have with respect to deposits maintained by public officials\n\n<$D> \n\nThe same objection Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$A> \n\nSustained  ,  for lack of basis \n\n<$B> \n\n You said   \n\n\nNow Mr Witness you said S H I refers to Special Hold Instruction is that correct\n\n\nWhen you say that an account is tagged as S H I and then the letters after that are G H list does this mean Greenhills list\n\n<$C> \n\nYes Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen an account is tagged does that mean that an account officer or an officer of the bank takes care focuses on that particular account\n\n<$D> \n\nLeading Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$A> \n\nSustained\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat does that mean when an account is tagged as ace S H I\n\n<$D> \n\nThe question is immaterial Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$A> \n\nOverruled\n\n\nWitness may answer\n\n<$C> \n\nUh S H I means uh there could be special instructions there could be hold instructions\n\n\nSo it could be any series of instructions that we put on the customer memo so that when a customer comes to any branch it will be followed\n\n<$B> \n\nIn this particular case the deposit of Mrs Luisa P Ejercito the First Lady who is that officer that handles this account  ,  of Citibank \n\n<$D> \n\n I don't think that would be material   \n\n\nI don't think that would be material Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$A> \n\nThe uh since it is not a an unqualified objection it it is overruled\n\n<$D> \n\nWe have to object we have to object Your Honor on the ground that the question is immaterial\n\n<$A> \n\nOverruled\n\n<$C> \n\nThe uh account officer is Marivic Pantaleon\n\n<$B> \n\nThank you Mr Witness, \n\n\nIs  Marivic Pantaleon still the account officer  ,  if she is\n\n<$D> \n\n Immaterial   immaterial Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$B> \n\nI I withdraw that question Mr Chief Justice\n\n\nAnyway we will find that out in due time\n\n\nLet me bring you now to exhibit\n\n<$A> \n\nAvoid avoid immaterial uh, avoid some uh objections based on immateriality so you can go and move faster\n\n<$B> \n\nI want to\n\n<$A> \n\nI know you can do that\n\n<$B> \n\nYes Mr Chief Justice but it seems to me that uh-uh my esteemed colleague in the profession Atty  Flaminiano is so sensitive to these instruments\n\n<$A> \n\nNo it is not sensitivity  ,  I guess we try to save time \n\n<$D> \n\n If Your Honor please   \n\n<$B> \n\nYes Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$A> \n\nGo direct to the point\n\n<$B> \n\nExhibit septuple F dash four uh and Exhibit I 'm sorry uh and the submarked uh items marked Exhibit septuple F dash two and septuple F dash three\n\n\nThis is a microfilm copy of the check drawn by issued by Governor Luis Chavit Singson dated August twenty, September twenty-nine nineteen ninety-nine for eight million payable to cash and uh signed by him\n\n\nNow on Exhibit septuple F dash three at the right side of this check numbers appear one six six eight two zero\n\n\nCan you please explain to this honorable court what these numbers mean\n\n<$D> \n\nMr Chief Justice these are the subject of our stipulations\n\n<$A> \n\nNot covered by the stipulation\n\n\nThe witness may answer\n\n\nIt is trying to explain an entry there\n\n<$C> \n\nOkay uh it is bank practice that we always ensure that the account number is written at the back of the check to make sure that it is uh you know if there is uh audit trail that shows that where the check is being credited to\n\n\nJust in case there are returns or are there are problems with the check we know where the account uh where the check belongs to Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd whose account is this one six six eight two zero\n\n<$D> \n\nThat has been admitted Your Honor\n\n<$A> \n\nAdmitted already in the stipulation\n\n<$D> \n\nStipulations yes\n\n<$B> \n\nMr Chief Justice uh the next question then is since the check was deposited to this account were the proceeds of this check credited to this account\n\n<$D> \n\n  The answer is very obvious  \n\n<$A> \n\n What is the objection   \n\n<$D> \n\nObjection Your Honor\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat is the basis\n\n<$D> \n\nFor being immaterial and for lack of basis\n\n<$A> \n\nOverruled because of the grounds invoked\n\n<$C> \n\nUh yes Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nIn the amount of how much\n\n<$C> \n\nUh just to qualify there were two checks that they but this one was an eight-million check Your Honor\n\n\nIt was credited Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd so since the deposit slip uh covered a total deposit of eight point four million the amount deposited or the amount credited total amount credited to the account of the First Lady C A S A Account Number one six six eight two zero was how much", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

you to testify in English, since you are a lawyer\n\n<$A> \n\nThank you Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$C> \n\nUh Mr Chief Justice and the Honorable Senator-Judges we are offering the testimony of this witness to prove that number one in nineteen ninety-nine there were unusual movements in the price and trading volume of B W Resources Corporation which is now known as Fairmont Holdings Incorporated one of the listed companies in the Philippine Stock Exchange, and that while B W Resources was incurring losses in its operation its stocks went up\n\n\nSecond the Compliance and Surveillance Group of the Philippine Stock Exchange investigated these unusual price and volume movements\n\n\nThird that the C S G or the Compliance and Surveillance Group found that the unusual price and volume movements of B W was the result of price manipulation and insider trading by Dante Tan and his associates\n\n\nFourth the witness will explain specific acts of manipulation done by Dante Tan and show examples thereof\n\n\nFifth the results of the C S Gs investigation are contained in an investigation report on B W Resources Corporation prepared by the witness principally\n\n\nSixth a copy of the report was given to President Joseph Ejercito Estrada in Malaca&ntilde;ang by Mr Jose Luis Nonoy Yulo Jr then President of the Philippine Stock Exchange and the witness himself\n\n\nSeventh the President defended Dante Tan\n\n\nEighth the President pressured then S E C Chairman Yasay and then Philippine Stock Exchange President Jose Luis Nonoy Yulo Jr to clear Dante Tan\n\n\nNinth in connection with the investigation of B W Resources President Estrada intimated to Mr Yulo and the witness during their audience with the President that Dante Tan paid then Chairman Yasay to have Dante Tan cleared in the B W scandal\n\n\nAnd tenth the witness resigned as vice-president and head of the C S G of the Philippine Stock Exchange because he felt that the Business Conduct and Ethics Committee of the Philippine Stock Exchange was about to whitewash the results of the C S G investigation particularly the participation of the brokers in the manipulative schemes of Mr Dante Tan\n\n\nMr Witness you stated that you were former vice-president and head of the Compliance and Surveillance Group of the Philippine  Stock Exchange\n\n\nWhen did you occupy these positions\n\n<$A> \n\nSince June nineteen ninety-seven until March seven two thousand   Your Honor  \n\n<$C> \n\n And as   head of the C S G or the Compliance and Surveillance Group what were your principal duties and responsibilities\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Compliance and Surveillance Group of the P S E serves as in a way the police the policeman of the Exchange\n\n\nWe make sure that trading in the stock market is fair efficient and transparent\n\n\nThat is my principal duty\n\n\nAnd in these duties I was assisted by three departments under my supervision Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nWhat were these three departments that you mentioned\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Compliance Audit Department which audits the books and records of all the brokers to make sure that clients are protected\n\n\nThe Special Investigation Department which handles investor complaints and conducts investigations when warranted\n\n\nAnd the Market Surveillance Department which looks at the market monitors the market on a day-to-day basis to make sure that there are no price manipulation or insider trading activities and other trading-related anomalies going on Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nAre you familiar with B W Resources Corporation\n\n<$A> \n\nYes Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nWhy are you familiar with that corporation\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause B W Resources Corporation is one of the listed companies of the Philippine Stock Exchange\n\n\nMoreover in nineteen ninety-nine when I was still head of the Compliance and Surveillance Group we conducted an investigation of transactions involving B W Resources Corporation\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd why did you conduct such an investigation\n\n<$A> \n\nIn nineteen ninety-nine B W was one of the most popular if not the most popular issue in the stock exchange\n\n\nIts, trading pattern was quite unusual\n\n\nThere was unusual price and volume movements\n\n\nIn fact it rose meteorically in  in October  in nineteen ninety-nine and plunged shortly thereafter\n\n\nWe we conducted the investigation to determine if these unusual price and volume movements was simply the result of free market forces or whether it was due to insider trading activities or price manipulation Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nUh what power or authority did you have to conduct such investigation\n\n<$A> \n\nThe Philippine Stock Exchange is a self-regulatory organization which means to say that it has the power to police its own ranks and this power was vested by the Securities and Exchange Commission\n\n\nIn the exercise of this power it is the C S G that handles investigations whenever there are anomalies in the market\n\n\nAside from that Your Honor we received specific orders and instructions from the S E C to conduct an investigation Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nFrom what time to what time did you conduct this investigation\n\n<$A> \n\nWe started the investigation in late May nineteen ninety-nine\n\n\nWe completed the investigation in February two thousand\n\n<$C> \n\nAt this point Your Honor I will be needing the exhibits but uh apparently the exhibits\n\n<$B> \n\nNot yet ready\n\n<$C> \n\nNot yet ready Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nWe can probably suspend\n\n\nHow much time would be needed\n\n<$C> \n Uh\n\n<$B> \n\nTry to find out\n\n<$C> \n\nAbout fifteen minutes Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nAbout fifteen minutes\n\n\nSo you are requesting for a suspension\n\n<$C> \n\nYes Your Honor\n\n\n  We are due for a recess  \n\n<$B> \n\n Fifteen minutes   \n\n\nAtty Flaminiano\n\n<$D> \n\nWe have no objection Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$B> \n\nThere being none uh the trial is suspended for fifteen minutes\n\n\nWe will resume at uh five fifteen  \n\n\nAtty Perez\n\n<$C> \n\nWith the permission of the Honorable Chief Justice and the Honorable Senator-Judges we have caused to be distributed Your Honors copies of our exhibits with the exception of Exhibit septuple seven which is currently being copied\n\n\nThat uh exhibit Your Honor will be presented later and it is estimated that by the time I reach to septuple seven we would have uh M rather we would have finished with the other exhibits\n\n\nSo, may I proceed Your Honor\n\n<$B> \n\nYou may\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd uh for purposes Your Honor of\n\n<$E> \n\nPardon me Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$B> \n\nYes uh what is the pleasure of Atty Daza\n\n<$E> \n\nYes uh in the meantime can we be furnished uh with copies of the\n\n<$B> \n\nYou mean you were not given copies of the exhibits\n\n<$E> \n\nNo not yet\n\n<$B> \n\nThe defense should have been given first\n\n<$E> \n\nWe 've just received a copy\n\n\nThank you Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$C> \n\nUh Your Honor may we be allowed to set up the overhead  projector so that uh we will be able to show transparencies\n\n<$B> \n\nNo objection\n\n\nThere being none uh the request is granted\n\n<$C> \n\nMr Witness you stated that you started the investigation of B W Resources in May nineteen ninety-nine\n\n\nWhat were the circumstances that led to the investigation of the said B W Resources\n\n<$A> \n\nIn May nineteen ninety-nine the price of B W, jumped from from a price of three ninety-five at uh the start of the month to eleven pesos by the end of May nineteen ninety-nine Your Honor\n\n\nThis was quite unusual and this was coupled by the fact that the value turnover the volume and the value turnover of B W for that month was almost twice the volume during the previous four months starting from January February March up to April Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nDo you have a table showing the price and volume movement of B W Resources from January to June of nineteen ninety-nine\n\n<$A> \n\nYes Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nI 'm showing to you this document which for purposes of identification had previously been marked as Exhibit septuple seven\n\n\nWhat is the relation of, uh L rather L, what is the relation of Exhibit septuple L with the document that you mentioned, \n\n\nMay I approach the witness Your Honor\n\n<$A> \n\nThis is the table which I prepared Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nMay I ask that the transparency of Exhibit septuple L be shown in the overhead projector\n\n<$B> \n\nProvide uh a seat to the young lady so, we can also see from  from uh this distance\n\n<$C> \n\nWill you please explain to us the movement of the price and also volume of B W stocks as shown in septuple L\n\n<$A> \n\nAs I mentioned earlier Your Honor in May nineteen ninety-nine the price of B W which started at three ninety-five at the beginning of the month rose to eleven pesos per share at the end of the month\n\n\nAnd this is shown in the table marked as Exhibit septuple L\n\n\nAs you can also see from the table the volume turnover for that month was four hundred three million four hundred two thousand two hundred sixty-five which if compared with the volume turnover for the previous four months is more or less double the volume for the previous months Your Honor\n\n\nConsidering that there were no corporate disclosures during that month of any developments in the company that would, create investor interest Your Honor the Market Surveillance Department of the C S G thought that this price movement and volume movement in May nineteen ninety-nine was unusual and indicative of possible price manipulation or insider trading Your Honor\n\n\nAnd that is why we started conducting an investigation and reviewing transactions of B W and closely monitoring its price Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nConsidering that there were no disclosures made regarding the possible change in the prices of uh B W shares what was the effect of the changes in the price on the volume value and market capitalization of B W Resources\n\n<$D> \n\nMr Chief Justice\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$D> \n\nWe have to object unless the proper qualification of the witness to answer this particular question is first laid\n\n\nMay we inquire whether the witness is being presented as an expert witness on stock trading on stocks or is he being presented merely as an ordinary witness\n\n\nOtherwise we will have to object to   all  these questions\n\n<$B> \n\n The   the witness was qualified earlier as to his position in the Philippine Stock Exchange and uh the the functions uh of his office\n\n\nWere you not satisfied with the definition of his functions\n\n<$D> \n\nI I am not really quite satisfied with uh   his qualifications  \n\n<$B> \n\n Then you can subject that on cross-examination later   \n\n<$D> \n\nThank you Mr Chief Justice\n\n<$C> \n\nUh in case the witness has forgotten the question let me rephrase uh the question\n\n\nUh because of the volume of the transaction in B W shares what was the effect of that volume in the market capitalization of B W\n\n<$A> \n\nYour Honor the market capitalization of B W because of that increase in volume and value turnover also increased Your Honor\n\n\nAnd this is shown in another table which I prepared Your Honor and which has been marked as Exhibit septuple L dash one Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nIn septuple L dash one under the column \" volume \" there are figures indicated opposite the words \" January February March April May and June \" will you explain to us the meaning of those figures\n\n<$A> \n\nThe the figures appearing in that column Your Honor is the volume of the transactions or the shares transacted during that month Your Honor\nin millions Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd opposite the month and under the column \" value \" open parenthesis billions close parenthesis there are figures indicated\n\n\nCould you explain to us the meaning of that\n\n<$A> \n\nThat is the value of the transactions on B W during that month Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd below the column \" rank \" there are figures appearing after each month from January to June\n\n\nCould you explain to us the meaning of that\n\n<$A> \n\nThe rank that appears here is the rank of B W among the top twenty listed companies in terms of trading value Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nUh with that as an  explanation could you tell, could you tell us the rank of B W Resources as of January as reflected in Exhibit  septuple L dash one\n\n<$A> \n\nAs shown in the exhibit Your Honor in January nineteen ninety-nine it was ranked sixteenth Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nHow about in the month of June nineteen ninety-nine what was the ranking of B W Resources\n\n<$A> \n\nIn June it suddenly became rank number one Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nDid you examine if there was a reason for this unusual movement of shares\n\n<$A> \n\nThat was precisely Your Honor the subject of our investigation\n\n\nWe wanted to find out if this unusual movement in the volume and price of B W was the result of simply free market forces or whether it was due to possible insider trading or price manipulation Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nIn the course of your investigation did you come across the financial statements of B W Resources Corporation for the first quarter of nineteen ninety-nine\n\n<$A> \n\nYes Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nI 'm showing to you Exhibit septuple L dash two which has been which is consisting of, eight pages\n\n\nWill you please tell us if what is the relation of this document with the one that you have examined\n\n<$A> \n\nThis uh document marked as Exhibit septuple L dash two is the quarterly report of B W Resources Corporation as of the period ended March thirty-one nineteen ninety-nine which we got from the records of the Philippine Stock Exchange in the course of our investigation Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd did you come across the financial statements of the said corporation for the quarter ending June thirty nineteen ninety-nine\n\n<$A> \n\nYes Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nI 'm showing to you Exhibit septuple L dash ten up to Exhibit septuple L dash sixteen\n\n\nWhat is the relation of this document with the financial statements that you have examined\n\n<$A> \n\nThis document which has been marked as Exhibit septuple L dash ten is the second quarterly report of B W Resources Corporation for the month ended June thirty nineteen ninety-nine Your Honor which we got from the records of the Philippine Stock Exchange when we conducted our investigation Your Honor\n\n<$C> \n\nSo that we may be able to understand the impact of the profit and loss statement contained in the financial statements for the first quarter of nineteen ninety-nine of B W Resources did you prepare the corresponding table showing the profit and loss statements of B W Resources\n\n<$A> \n\nYes Your Honor we prepared the table showing the profit and loss statement of B W for the first quarter which we obtained from the exhibit marked as Exhibit quintuple L dash two\n\n<$C> \n\nI 'm showing to you this document which has been previously marked as uh Exhibit septuple L dash seventeen, \n\n\nWhat is the relation of this document with the profit and loss

your signature did you have any participation in the preparation and drafting of these Articles of Incorporation and the other documents\n\n<$E> \n\nNo the documents were all prepared\n\n\nUh in fact uh incorporation papers already contained the signatures of the other lawyers\n\n<$D> \n\nYou also mentioned that it was upon the request of uh Atty Serapio coursed through the uh secretary and the assistant uh Atty Michael de los Reyes that you acted on the uh Articles of Incorporation of these two corporations \n\n\nNow at the time you signed these Articles of Incorporation was Atty Serapio

confirm that you signed these two uh secretary 's certificates\n\n<$E> \n\nYes I signed these uh certificates the same day I signed the incorporation papers\n\n<$D> \n\nIn this uh secretary 's

entry which states that the corporation is authorized to negotiate for the purchase of the shares of stocks of R N Development Corporation\n\n\nAt the time you signed this uh certificate secretary 's

uh let me call your attention also to the next paragraph after that \n\n\nIt states here that uh Resolved that the Acting Executive Vice-President uh Mr Leonardo B Dayao is authorized to negotiate sign execute and deliver for and in behalf of the corporation all the documents necessary to effect the foregoing resolution particularly the purchase of the R N Development Corporation \n\n\nWhen you signed this secretary 's certificate did you know this  Acting Executive Vice-President Mr Leonardo B Dayao who was authorized to negotiate for the purchase of uh the R N Development Corporation\n\n<$F> \n\nYour Honor please the question is irrelevant uh precisely the resolution authorizes uh the axec Executive Vice-President to to negotiate to sign and execute in behalf of the corporation relating to the purchase of the shares\n\n<$A> \n\nThe objection uh is sustained but not for the reason given but uh for the reason that the best evidence is the document itself\n\n<$D> \n\nYour Honor please uh what we are trying to this is a motion for reconsideration Your Honor\n\n\nWhat the prosecution is trying to establish now is that these corporations are nothing but dummy corporations set up   to acquire the R N Development Corporation  \n\n<$A> \n\n Then go direct to the point   \n\n<$D> \n\nAnd Your Honor please, while it is true that the document is the best evidence but whether or not the Corporate Secretary knows the identity of this  Leonardo B Dayao is an independently relevant statement Your Honor that transcends beyond the existence of this particular document\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you are offering the same as an independently relevant statement\n\n<$D> \n\nYes Your Honor it has a significance\n\n<$A> \n\nUh then with more reason that the

\n\nMake the tender of proof\n\n<$D> \n\nThat if the witness is asked about this Atty Leonardo B Dayao the witness does not actually know this person who was authorized in this document as the uh person to negotiate for the purchase of the R N Development Corporation and she does not know anything about this particular purchase Your Honor\n\n<$A> \n\nLet the proffer of proof stay on record\n\n<$D> \n\nNow aside from these two documents the uh Alexie Holdings Incorporated which were already identified yesterday and uh stipulations were already made as to the existence of these two documents and of course including the authenticity of the signatures I presume of these uh two documents, both for the Alexie Holdings Incorporated and the uh Pio Holdings uh Corporation\n\n\nNow aside from these documents uh Ms Witness can you uh tell us if you executed any other document in relation to these two corporations\n\n<$E> \n\nYes I also signed uh blank deed of assignment\n\n<$D> \n\nWhat do you mean by \" blank deed of assignment \" \n\n<$E> \n\nThe the name of the assignee and the date of the document were uh both left in blanks\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd uh what did you assign in in

assignments\n\n\nWhere is that document indicating uh your signature in that blank deed of assignments\n\n<$F> \n\nSame objection Your Honor  \n\n\nWhere is the signature \n\n\nObviously it 's in the document\n\n<$D> \n\nWhere is the document now\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm the Chair should first make a ruling\n\n\nSustained\n\n\nMake another question\n\n<$D> \n\nUh Ms uh Witness you testified earlier that you signed a blank deed of assignment\n\n\nNow my question is uh where is that document now that blank deed of assignment\n\n<$E> \n\nI do not know Your Honor\n\n<$D> \n\nAfter you signed that blank deed of assignment to whom did you turn over that blank deed of assignment\n\n<$E> \n\nAlso to Atty Michael de los Reyes\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd what did you assign in those uh blank deed of assignments\n\n<$F> \n\nThe best evidence is the document  \n\n<$A> \n\nSustained\n\n<$D> \n\nYour Honor please uh considering\n\n<$A> \n\nThe the Chair will not recommend to you what to do but you know how to establish secondary evidence whenever the document cannot be produced\n\n<$D> \n\nThat is correct Your Honor\n\n\nWe have already laid down the basis that the documents are in the possession of Atty Michael de los Reyes and this Atty Michael de los Reyes is actually working as an  assistant of Atty Edward Serapio\n\n\nSo we cannot produce these documents right now Your Honor and we are still in the process   of  \n\n<$A> \n\n You   were the one saying it\n\n\nLet it come from the witness so you could ask for the next question\n\n<$D> \n\nThat is why Your Honor, our next our last question was what did you assign in in the blank deed of assignments \n\n<$F> \n\nEven if it is well objectionable I will not object anymore so that   since this is supposed to be the last question  \n\n<$A> \n\n The objection is withdrawn   \n\n\nThe witness may now answer the question\n\n<$D> \n\nWhat did you assign\n\n<$E> \n\nI assigned my shares uh in the two companies\n\n<$D> \n\nHow about the other incorporators\n\n\nDid you know if they also executed similar deed of assignments over the shares in the uh corporation\n\n<$E> \n\nI would assume that they uh also signed those uh documents\n\n<$D> \n\nWhat do you mean \" I would assume \" \n\n<$E> \n\nThe normal practice in that law firm was for the in case the lawyers were to act as incorporators they would sign the incorporation documents simultaneously with the deeds of trust\n\n\nSo I would assume that that was what happened in this case\n\n<$D> \n\nNow after the corporations were registered and you mentioned also that uh you were the incorporator and a member of the Board in these two corporations now uh can you recall if you were notified of any meeting or activity of these two corporations\n\n<$E> \n\nWell after I signed those documents I was not notified of any further activity or event\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd you also mentioned that you were  also designated as a Corporate Secretary of these two corporations and uh do you remember if you executed a document in relation to your being Corporate Secretary of these two corporations\n\n<$E> \n\nUhm when I resigned from the law firm of uh De Borja Medialdea I also tendered my resignation as Corporate Secretary for the two corporations\n\n<$D> \n\nAnd to whom did you submit your letter of resignation as Corporate Secretary\n\n<$E> \n\nI submitted them to Atty de los Reyes\n\n<$D> \n\nThank that is all for the witness Your Honor\n\n<$A> \n\nCross-examination\n\n<$F> \n\nUh with the permission of the court uh Atty Banal uh for how long did you work uh with the law office of De Borja Medialdea\n\n<$E> \n\nI worked there for one year and eight months\n\n<$F> \n\nAnd uh you were assigned to the Corporate Department\n\n<$E> \n\nYes Your Honor\n\n<$F> \n\nAnd uh in that Corporate Department uh it is uh usual practice to prepare Articles of Incorporation in which members of the firm are named as incorporators and as members of the Board is it not\n\n<$E> \n\nYes Your Honor\n\n<$F> \n\nAnd uh so what you did in this particular case is uh usual practice in that firm\n\n<$E> \n\nYes Your Honor\n\n<$F> \n\nAnd that uh when a client comes and then uh needs a corporation uh uh corporations which had been previously organized are made available is it not \n\n<$E> \n\nYes Your Honor\n\n<$F> \n\nAnd that when the client uh decides to utilize that corporation all of the members of the firm who were designated incorporators and members of the Board uh execute deeds of assignment in favor of the nominees of the client is it not\n\n<$E> \n\nYes\n\n<$F> \n\nAnd that is usual and standard practice\n\n<$E> \n\nYes\n\n<$F> \n\nNothing wrong with that is it not\n\n<$E> \n\nNone\n\n<$F> \n\nYou would not engage in anything that is illegal is it not\n\n<$E> \n\nNo\n\n<$F> \n\nAnd that is that is perfectly legal is it not\n\n<$E> \n\nThe incorporation yes\n\n<$F> \n\nYes\n\n\nThank you very much\n\n\nNo more no further questions\n\n<$A> \n\nAny questions from the members of the Impeachment Court\n\n<$D> \n\nTwo re-direct questions Your Honor\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no not yet, \n\n\nThe agreement uh among the members of the

questions\n\n<$D> \n\nIn this particular thank you Your Honor in this particular case uh Ms Witness regarding the incorporation of uh the Pio Holding and the Alexie Holding Corporation there was no client who appeared before you and it was only Atty Serapio who requested for these two corporations\n\n\nAm I correct\n\n<$F> \n\nImproper for re-direct Your Honor\n\n\n  I did not cover that at all  \n\n<$A> \n\n Improper for re-direct   \n\n\nThe objection is sustained\n\n<$D> \n\nYour Honor please uh there was a statement in the cross-examination which tried to create the impression that uh everything was regular in this particular case\n\n<$A> \n\nThat was the answer given by   the witness  \n\n<$D> \n\n But uh   in this particular case Your Honor what we are trying to elicit that no principal actually revealed himself to the witness except Atty Serapio who at that time was already working in Malaca&ntilde;ang\n\n\nSo we believe Your Honor this particular line of question would somehow clarify that particular point that was raised during the cross-examination Your Honor\n\n<$F> \n\nIf Your Honor please uh probably it should be noted that the witness is uh was but an associate or an assistant in that firm and clients do not deal with the  associates or assistants and   that was  that is why that was not covered by the cross-examination\n\n\nAll that uh was covered by the cross-examination was whether this having uh uh members of the firm sign as incorporators and directors is usual practice\n\n<$D> \n\n Then let the witness", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL",

his statement just a while ago\n\n\nBut the allegation is this Your Honor  the President by that\nsworn statement also committed perjury and the offense of unexplained wealth\nbecause  this is the this is the point Your Honor  because\nrecords show that he and his wife and mistresses and their children have\nother assets in other companies outside of the three firms listed in his\nstatement of assets and liabilities  \n\n\nThose are the only assets\n\n<$D> \n\nThat that had been read into the records already\n\n<$C> \n\nYes Your Honor that is why the tendency of the question now is\nto elicit the answers that will not be evidentiary of what has been alleged\nin the articles of impeachment\n\n\nSo\n\n<$D> \n\nIt there could be some kind of evidentiary value but the it is\nthe manner

thirty\nmillion equity\n\n\nThey start uh developing the property and getting everything in the\nproperty but they don't give me the money, \n\n\nSo as far as I 'm concerned I do not have any agreement with them\n\n\nThey are spending hundreds of thousands of pesos already but they\nhad not given me yet the money\n\n\nTherefore our transaction is not yet finish\n\n\nThey should have given me the first agreement of thirty million\npesos uh equity that is uh last week\n\n\nBut the  they continue developing the property making\nsome ground planning and operation but yet  ha  they had not\npaid us yet\n\n\nUh I had been informed that this buyer is interested of the\nproperty because they want to give give uh get that as golf\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nNow I had been telling you

is here\nthis morning and yesterday the whole day he was here, \n\n\nUh see uhm\n\n\nNow, no not only talked they had been and his family been in the\narea they had resurveyed the area\n\n\nThey had planned already I think they had they had spent already\nhundred hundreds of thousands there in that area already\n\n\nNow, I see, \n\n\nUh it is your group who make the study of the golf uh the golf\ncourse of Mr  Chanco  \n\n\n Ay naku  how so this is as good as uh finished\n\n ano  \n\n\nYes I am only waiting for Mr  Chanco  to pay me here because\nI, he 's playing golf while I 'm waiting

him because you are now in access\nwith him that Atty Musclares is waiting for that ten million he promised me\nyesterday\n\n\nOkay Mr  Manzano  \n\n\nUh so it is really  a very small world  \nano  \n\n\nThis is, I see Mr Gozon is very very happy here that you uh that\nthe transaction is closed  \n\n\nYes yes I will take good care of it\n\n\nOkay follow this up for me okay\n\n\nThank you very much Mr uh bye\n\n\n First concern  niya\n\n we are the one who make the project study and feasibility study of\nMr  Chanco  who submitted it already in bank and there is an approval\nof the two hundred million already for this property, \n\n\nSo that is the situation at present\n\n<$B> \n\nSir what will happen to the letter of authority\n\n<$A> \n\nNow uh look never mind, Mr  Chanco  want to develop\nthe property into golf\n\n\nIf he will not pay me I 'll sell it to  Manzano , \n\n\nThe same plan okay because I do not care for Mr  Chanco  as\nlong as he doesn't pay me\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah first come first served\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes if uh you you tell Mr  Manzano  if he will Mr\n\n Chanco  will not pay me until tomorrow morning the the deal is off\n, \n\n\nSo Mr  Manzano  can buy my property okay\n\n\nHe pay me twenty million thirty million pesos tomorrow I 'll I 'll\nsign the agreement\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's not  Manzano  who is the buyer\n\n<$A> \n\nYes whoever is the  ano  uh, \n\n\nAccording to him it is a uh  ano  uh  siguro\nuh sa nangyayari dito ngayon  Mr  Chanco  is  lalabas\ndito  Mr  Manzano  is the developer\n\n\nNow they had made an arrangement with the bank and according to Mr\n\n Manzano  there is an approval of the two hundred million\n\n\nThat is to confirm also  Chanco  told me two days ago\n\n\nNow with  Chanco  now entertaining the Japanese that might\nbe with our plan with  Chanco  because we become here a partner with\nMr  Chanco  as long as he give me the thirty million pesos requirement\nequity\n\n\nNow if the Japanese will pay him this twenty million dollar of the\nfinished golf then the obligation we got with the bank will be paid\nautomatically and  Manzano  might be there inside\n\n\nNow if Mr  Chanco  will not make good on his commitment to\nme I can deal directly to  Manzano  with this authority through you Mr\nGozon okay\n\n\nSo I am not afraid with anybody I 'll give you the authority\n\n\nFirst come first serve\n\n\nFive percent uh over price  ,  \n\n\nThere must be this  and is only for one week\n\n\n You give Mr Gozon only one week time to\ntransact we cannot wait that much  ano uh kwan  only one week\nuh Nette  ilagay mo   this authority is only good for\none week  uh\n\n\nBecause if it is true  na   Manzano  is\ninside and he they are going to buy me out because of the loan approval uh\nokay  lang yan sa akin  \n\n\n<unclear> words </unclear> okay  lang 'yan sa akin  \nbecause uh the way I look at it they they make me as a, the pawn of the\ntransaction  hindi ba  \n\n\nThe most important to me I can use my money for another purpose\nokay\n\n\n Ngayon  only five days\n\n<$B> \n\n Commission   \n\n<$C> \n\nFive days\n\n<$A> \n\nUh five days only five days\n\n\nI mean Mr Gozon that will also drive everybody to close the\ntransaction\n\n\nRemember  na  I gave you this authority because of\n\n pakiusap ni  Mrs Galido\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nI do not give that authority anymore\n\n\nNow  kapag nagkaipitan tayo ng panahon at nakita kong\nmaganda ang lakad ng inyong  transaction I can extend it to you okay\n\n\nJust for the meantime place there only five days\n\n\nSo today is twenty-two it will terminate on the twenty-seventh, \nokay\n\n<$B> \n\nTo twenty nine\n\n<$A> \n\nTwenty nine no five days uh  wala namang kwenta 'yon\ntingnan no binigyan ako ng  special authority  dito mabasa man\nni  Chanco  'yon hindi ako mapapahiya  \n\n\nBecause  sabihin ko sa kaniya eh hinantay kita na bigyan mo\nako ng kuwarta kahapon hindi di  I opened it to the market again\n\n\nNo okay\n\n\nThat will be the situation okay five six only five days\n\n<$B> \n\n Hindi pa tapos  \n\n<$A> \n\n Hindi pa tapos tatapusin natin  \n\n<$C> \n\nSir  nagmamadali rin naman si  Mr  Manzano\n\n so five days is okay\n\n<$A> \n\nYes you see the advantages of this five days  \n\n kuwan  authority is uh upon presentation of that authority to\nyour buyer the that will be in black and white that you are only given five\ndays as a concession of Mrs Galido\n\n\nNow without them to execute uh we lost the transaction\n\n\nNow  kung halimbawa naman nasa  in  na kayo\n\n we are we are there are just a little thing to be ironed out and the\nfive days had run out I will be kind enough to extend you another uh so many\ndays\n\n<$C> \n\n Iniisip ko sir baka si Mr  Chanco  baka isa\nsiya sa  group  kasi  Mr  Manzano  is only a\ntrustee\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I the way I look at it he told me  nga  \n\n he is one of my partner and besides we had been to lunch today and uh\nwe are the one making his project study  \n\n<$C> \n\n Kasi ho gusto ho naming gusto ho naming pasyalan 'yung\nlugar kasama namin si   ,  \n\n<$A> \n\n Mr  Chanco    \n\n<$C> \n\nMr  Manzano  \n\n<$A> \n\nMr  Manzano  no Mr  Chanco  just come in\n\n mga  fifteen days ago  ,  with his wife and\nchildren, \n\n\nBecause he is associated I think he is the  balae  \nof of uh George  See  of the  Philippine Bank  the owner of the\nano and then he has an arrangement also with the Philippine National Bank\nthrough  Lopez  \n\n\nSo, there might be some sort of arrangement so what is\nimportant to me is to finish the transaction\n\n\nUh  Chanco  will call for me because Mr  Manzano  \nwill contact  Chanco  \n\n\nI told him  let  Chanco  know that I am only giving\nhim until tomorrow for the ten million if not I will accept anybody uh\n\n  ano  \n\n\nIf they will see your authority then I he can I can tell him\n\n na   well I gave that authority first come first serve\nuh because I need the money very badly

okay, why don't we start up with how old are you\nright at this moment\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'm eighteen years old\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay eighteen and are you married\n\n<$A> \n\nNo not yet\n\n<$B> \n\nAre you uh what religion do you belong to\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'm a Catholic\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay and uh where do you reside\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I reside at, B F Homes Para&ntilde;aque\n\n<$B> \n\nIs this your first time you ever sought consult with me\n\n<$A> \n\nYes Doctor\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so what 's your chief complaint\n\n\nWhat 's wrong\n\n\nWhat do you feel right now\n\n<$A> \n\nI have been coughing for a week now and I am having a hard\ntime talking 'cause there 's this phlegm in my throat\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so your chief complaint is cough\n\n\nAnd okay let 's move on to your uhm the history of your present\nillness and according to you it 's been for a week now\n\n\nCould you, could you go through this uh, uh on detail\n\n\nWhat happened first\n\n\nDid you have cough at first, or did you have any fever back then\n\n<$A> \n\nI first had this cold\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah and then a slight fever\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you had a low-grade fever a week ago\n\n\nLet 's start, okay seven days ago you had colds\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm did you have any cough with this at that time\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm no not that time\n\n\nIt was around two days after\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay did you have a sore throat with it\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay you had difficulty swallowing\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh I had a hard time eating\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay and uh any fever\n\n<$A> \n\nNot then, no\n\n<$B> \n\nNo fever okay now six days ago, uh the same symptoms\npersisted right\n\n<$A> \n\nYes Doctor\n\n<$B> \n\nDid you have any uh cough then\n\n<$A> \n\nNo no\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you just had cough five days ago\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay let 's say five days ago\n\n\nWas the cough dry or was it productive of phlegm\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah it was I had phlegm\n\n<$B> \n\nDid the fever persist until this day\n\n<$A> \n\nNo not much just the cough\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you didn't have any fever anymore\n\n\nDid your fever, so your fever <unclear> word </unclear> but you\nhad cough and phlegm\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat was the color of the phlegm would you say\n\n<$A> \n\nAt first it was white\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay whitish\n\n<$A> \n\nThen after two days it turned into green\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so uhm, three days ago you noticed your phlegm to have\nchanged to green and uh I suppose you had fever at this time\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay it was how would you say it was high-grade or\nmoderate-grade low-grade\n\n<$A> \n\nIt was a high grade\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay was it persistent\n\n\nDid it persist the whole day or uh did it go down\n\n<$A> \n\nIt went down\n\n<$B> \n\nDid you take any uh medications with this\n\n<$A> \n\nYes Doctor\n\n<$B> \n\nFor fever I suppose\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay, so that 's the reason why it went down\n\n\nOkay uhm, so you 're presenting here with cough of a week 's\nduration,  enunciated  by colds fever uh moderate to high grade and\nyou 'd say that the cough is productive of greenish phlegm\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay based on this alone I could tell you that you 've had a\nbacterial bacterial infection which most probably would be causing your fever\nand that will be persistent and the only reason why your fever had gone down\nfirst time was because of the analgesic you took and uh anti-pyretic, \n\n\nSo let 's move on to your past history, uh would you have any\nhypertension\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nDiabetes\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nAsthma\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nWere you ever hospitalized before\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nHow about operated on\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay uhm do you have any smoking history\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nUh, how much do you smoke\n\n<$A> \n\nI smoke around five sticks a day\n\n<$B> \n\nFor how long now\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm, three years\n\n<$B> \n\nThree years, okay and do you have any alcoholic beverage\nintake\n\n<$A> \n\nNo not much just a bit\n\n\nI drink occasionally when there 's you know\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay occasionally for how long now\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm, about four five years\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm, so I presume you 're a college student\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay and in your family history do you have any  heredity\n\n familial diseases like asthma\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nIs there any diabetes\n\n<$A> \n\nYes there is\n\n<$B> \n\nUh who has diabetes in the family\n\n<$A> \n\nMy mother\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay uh hypertension\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nAny uh any family member with  uh tuberculosis\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay, how about heart diseases\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nCancer\n\n<$A> \n\nNo none of that\n\n<$B> \n\nSeizures\n\n<$A> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm, okay, so I guess I just have to do a little\nphysical examination on you now\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah, would it be hard for me\n\n<$B> \n\nNo uh that 's no problem\n\n\nSo I would just be seated for a while and I 'll proceed with my\nexamination\n\n<$A> \n\nThank you Doctor\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay uh, would you please take a deep breath  \n\n\nOkay uhm I see that uh, your  sclera  aren't uh\nyellowish your conjunctiva are pink\n\n\nUhm, you have some lymph nodes here on your neck\n\n\nAnd please open your mouth\n\n<$A> \n\nUh  \n\n<$B> \n\nOkay that 's good and uh I could see that your tonsils are\ninflamed and they 're <unclear> word </unclear> so that 's another sign of\ninfection plus the lymph nodes on your neck\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat is the lymph nodes mean I mean uh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh it 's just a, it just accounts more for uh the fact\nthat you have a bacterial infection and the lymph nodes are swollen at this\nmoment\n\n\nSo you have an active infection going on right now\n\n\nOkay uh take another deep breath please  \n\n\nOkay that 's good\n\n\nNow you 're, you have uh equal and symmetrical expansion of\nyour chest, and you don't have any retractions in your  inter-coastal\n\n spaces\n\n\nUh apparently I hear some fine rals in the base in your lung bases\n\n\nUhm this could be, this could be the reason for your production\nof phlegm\n\n\nOkay I 'll just listen to your heart\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm, \n\n<$B> \n\nWell the it 's normal, rate regular rhythm\n\n\nYou don't seem to have any murmurs\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay uhm, let me just palpate your stomach for a while\n, listen to it, \n\n\nOkay as I 've observed that your abdomen is flat it 's firm\n\n\nYou don't have any organo- <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n\nI don't see any organo- <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n\nI don't feel any organo- <unclear> word </unclear> no masses and\napparently it 's not tender\n\n<$A> \n\nOrgano-, what\n\n<$B> \n\nWell it just means that you don't have any enlarged uh organs\nabnormally enlarged organs\n\n\nAh your pulses are full and equal and you don't have any edema\n\n\nOkay that 's good, well with uh based on my history and\nphysical examination Mr Gonzales uh I would say you, have an upper\nrespiratory tract infection prior to which you had an acute tonsil or\npharyngitis\n\n\nUh I 'd advise you to definitely stop smoking and uh kind of\nabstain from the alcohol uhm and I 'll just have to prescribe you some\nantibiotics, some anti-pyretics for this and uh, I 'll just have to ask\nyou to follow up in a week\n\n\nOkay Sir\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah sure Doctor  ,  if you say so\n\n<$B> \n\n Okay   \n\n\nIt 's just an upper respiratory tract infection\n\n\nBut uh make sure you don't take it for granted you might have uh\npneumonia later on\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay, thank you very much Doctor\n\n<$B> \n\nGood day Sir\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah have a nice day too  \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nCould you explain to me the use of this F R solution for uh\ncanal filling\n\n<$B> \n\nUh yes I think I have uh tried it to my patient already and\nuh it seems that the uh the prognosis was very good and uh I would like to\norient you with this also\n\n\nYou see when we use uh antiphormine instead of oxidol we\nneutralize it with oxidol because uh it might cause degeneration of F R\n\n\nAnd secondly we have to take note that uh F R calcium hardens more\nquickly when the temperature and humidity is high in the operatory\n\n\nUh that is also the reason why uh, why F R solution are kept in\nuh in uh dark bottles\n\n\nBecause of the alcohol content of this uh F R solution there is a\npossibility that it will then evaporate quickly\n\n\nSo we have to be sure that uh uh when we use it be sure that uh\nwhen you cover it again the cap should be tightly closed\n\n\nAnd the uh because of air or moisture which causes degeneration of\nF R powder you should see to it also that uh the cap of the powder is uh\nthoroughly closed\n\n<$A> \n\nDoes this harden the F R with the powder if you if you mix\nthe F R with powder and liquid does it harden how many minutes or seconds\n\n<$B> \n\nWell it would take around uh five minutes inside the uh the\nuh pulp canal   before it hardens  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm   uh uhm and uh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd anyway it does not harden really that hard but uh you can\nuh uhm if you want to clean again the canal   you can  easily\nscrape it out\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh you can remove it\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah using the uhm what do you call this the uh  ribber\n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nHow do you how do you mix this\n\n\nDo you use metal or uh\n\n<$B> \n\nWell in my case I just use uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nMetal and glass slab\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah metal and uh metal spatula\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm metal\n\n<$B> \n\nThen mix the powder in the liquid in the glass slab\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm how long will it take, for the for mixing\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe uh three seconds\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nIt is very easy to mix such a solution, \n\n\nDo you know already the the direction uh for use\n\n<$A> \n\nHow 's the ratio, uh-huh, the ratio for using the\npowder and liquid\n\n<$B> \n\nOne is to one\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThen you mix it uniformly either in the mixing  pan  \nor in the glass slab\n\n\nBut in my case I use I use the glass slab for mixing\n\n<$A> \n\nHow do you apply it to the canal you\n\n<$B> \n\nYou make use of the uh <unclear> word </unclear> and then uh\nfill the canal and uh tightly, and be sure that the canal is uh well\nfilled up\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> is uh what I am using\n\n\nI don't know in your case\n\n\nYou can uh use the the instrument of your choice\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm either   either metal or uh what 's\nthis\n\n<$B> \n\nPlastic\n\n<$A> \n\nPlastic uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWe usually use <unclear> word </unclear> which is made of\nmetal\n\n<$A> \n\nMetal uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSpring type metal\n\n<$A> \n\nLike a carrier\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uhm yeah like that, \n\n\nAnd by the way you 'd be you don't have any problem regarding the\noverflowing of the uh acetyl solution or of the of the said mixture in the\napical foramen\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause it will uh just uh serve as <unclear> 2 words\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nUh just like the Vitatex\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah like Vitatex\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThe only difference of that is Vitatex is   more on\n\n uh it is premixed already\n\n<$A> \n\n In the mixing   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd it has what we call an antibiotic property\n\n<$A> \n\nHow about this F uh F R no antibiotics\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's more of a bactericidal and the essence of this the the\nessence itself of the solution is enough to to clean the gangrenous canal\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm how about in cases where uh there is a severe pain can we\nuse this uh liquid F R for uh treatment\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't think so because it does not have any analgesic\neffect\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo I did not try using it to my patient\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm this is only totally for\n\n<$B> \n\nRoot canal\n\n<$A> \n\nRoot canal treatment, \n\n<$B> \n\nWe use it mostly we also use it both for vital and non-vital\npulp\n\n<$A> \n\nHow about in gangrenous pulp\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nSame\n\n<$B> \n\nIt is uh effective in in  both gangrenous and\nnon-gangrenous pulp\n\n\nIn the case of  of uh vital uh pulp you uh sterilize\nthe canal first\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThen you let it dry like what you are using the same\nprocedure when you uhm use the other medicines of your choice  'no\n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBut since you are asking me regarding F R maybe it I might as\nwell tell you also the the uhm procedure\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThen after sterilizing you make use of the <unclear> word\n\n</unclear> again and then half fill the the uh rim portion of the canal\n\n\nCover it with the solution of uh F R\n\n\nThen after that you seal it with the cement\n\n<$A> \n\nUh can you seal it immediately after putting the F R or after\na few days\n\n<$B> \n\nAfter you have maybe after uhm a   few days  \n\n<$A> \n\n Twenty-four hours   \n\n<$B> \n\nFirst you let the cement dry\n\n<$A> \n\nTo settle   first  \n\n<$B> \n\n  Oo    \n\n\nAnd then put the permanent filling\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n\nAny permanent filling can be used\n\n<$B> \n\nAs long as you have the   uh  \n\n<$A> \n\n <unclear> word </unclear>   \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah as long as you have the uhm base, you put base\n\n<$A> \n\nUh I think the uh after the F R if it dries you can put the\npermanent filling\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh uh uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uh   either there is no base\n\n<$B> \n\nUh no no no you have to put first the the\n\n<$A> \n\nBase\n\n<$B> \n\nThe base before you make use of your   uh permanent\nfilling  \n\n<$A> \n\n Composite or   amalgam\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe with with amalgam, \n\n\nUh no no no both composite and amalgam there is a need for a base\n\n  just to  be sure\n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\nLike  bicarb  \n\n<$B> \n\nThat is if we are referring to a vital  porchotomy  \n\n<$A> \n\n Oo  \n\n<$B> \n\nBut for for non-vital it 's okay you can use it   \ndirectly  \n\n<$A> \n\n Directly  , uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat else, uh, I also have a case here\n\n\nUh I would like also to ask your

you know what what what 's the reason why it swells up\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you know the function of your lymph glands, \n\n\nNo\n\n\nThe lymph glands are supposed to contain lymphocytes, \n\n\nNow what are lymphocytes\n\n\nLymphocytes are supposed to be the soldiers of the body, okay\n\n\nYou have the white blood cells and the red blood cells remember\n\n\nNow the white blood cells and the lymphocytes  etcetera\netcetera , these are the soldiers of the body\n\n\nIn other words when there is an infection going on there is an\ninvading or microorganism like the bacteria, these soldiers of the body\nattack the bacteria they fight\n\n\nThere 's a war going on, \n\n\nThat 's why it swells up there 's a fight going on in that area, \n\n\nThat means you 've had an infection in

year\n\n<$D> \n\nFirst year\n\n<$A> \n\nFreshman\n\n\nWhat 's your temperature,   the nurse  took your\ntemperature\n\n<$D> \n\n Thirty-nine   thirty-nine\n\n<$A> \n\nThirty-nine, you have a fever\n\n\nThat means you have an infection\n\n\nWhat do you feel\n\n\nWhat are your complaints\n\n<$D> \n\nUhm headaches\n\n<$A> \n\nYou have a headache what else\n\n<$D> \n\nHeadaches muscle pain\n\n<$A> \n\nMuscular pain\n\n<$D> \n\nMuscular pain\n\n<$A> \n\nMuscular pain  ,  what else\n\n<$D> \n\nUh uhm\n\n\nAnd uhm I feel extremely hot\n\n<$A> \n\nFeverish, and you 're sick of school  ha  \n\n<$D> \n\nUh I have a cold\n\n<$A> \n\nUh you have a cold you also have a cold okay\n\n\nLet me take a look at your throat, say ah ah\n\n\nAre you coughing\n\n<$D> \n\nUhm a bit\n\n<$A> \n\nA bit, \n\n\nI 'll take a look at your lungs uh\n\n\nTurn around your back\n\n\nYou have to breathe hard inhale exhale  ha  \n\n\nGo ahead, okay, okay, \n\n\nResults are okay\n\n\nYou have no other signs and symptoms so most probably you have\nwhat you have is the flu influenza\n\n\nNow let me explain\n\n\nWhat is influenza\n\n\nInfluenza is a viral infection, \n\n\nNow when you say you have a viral infection there are two\nconnotations, okay\n\n\nOne connotation is it 's contagious, \n\n\nAnd that 's the reason why I 'm going to give you a note and you 're\nsupposed to go home to see your doctor okay, \n\n\nNow another connotation of influenza would be it means that there\nis no medicine that can kill the the causative organism the virus because it 's\na viral infection\n\n\nTherefore the treatment would uh be the treatment is geared only\ntowards alleviating your symptoms\n\n\nIf you have a fever take something for fever\n\n\nIf you 're coughing take something for cough, and uh you have\nto rest and take plenty of fluids\n\n\nSo I 'm sending you home with one slip I 'll give you the slip\nokay\n\n\nNow when you come back get the slip from us, I would want to\nmake sure it 's no longer contagious\n\n\nAt any rate see your doctor, \n\n\nNow sometimes your doctors will give you antibiotics\n\n\nNow you may ask why, \n\n\nAntibiotics are supposed to kill bacteria not viruses but the\nreason why your doctor might sometimes give you antibiotic is to prevent\nbacterial complications, that might kill you like bronchopneumonia\nmeningitis okay\n\n\nSo, by the way the longer you stay in campus the more people\nwill get your disease, \n\n\nSo this is the note okay  \n\n<$E> \n\nI have a sore throat doc\n\n<$A> \n\nYou have a sore throat\n\n\nDo you think you have the flu\n\n<$E> \n\nJust a sore throat\n\n<$A> \n\nHave you had your temperature taken by the nurse\n\n<$E> \n\nYes I\n\n<$A> \n\nHow how high how high is it\n\n<$E> \n\n Sabi niya sa 'kin  thirty-seven\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's thirty-seven,  eksakto   , \n\n thirty-seven\n\n\nThat 's not a fever probably it 's beginning, the beginning of\nsomething\n\n\nMay I see your throat, \n\n\nSay ah\n\n\nIs it painful when you swallow\n\n<$E> \n\n Uhm   \n\n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's your tonsils that is inflamed\n\n<$E> \n\nSir, I have a test I have to get the  ano  \nI should get an excuse\n\n<$A> \n\nYou have a test\n\n\nYou 're not coughing  ha  no\n\n\nI 'll just check your lungs I 'll just check your lungs\n\n\nTurn around your back\n\n\nHave a seat have a seat, have a seat just turn you around\n\n\nOkay, inhale exhale, again inhale exhale, \n\n\nBreathe, \n\n\nYour lungs are okay\n\n\nYour tonsils are inflamed and they 're swollen, \n\n\nSo most probably you are coming up with an acute tonsillitis\n\n\nNow what is it\n\n\nIt is supposed to be a bacterial infection\n\n\nNow the treatment for that is the   antibiotics,  \n\n\nWe do not carry antibiotics in the clinic, so you have to get\nthem yourself\n\n\nSo see your doctor  ha  \n\n\nAnd I 'm sure your doctor will prescribe some antibiotics\n\n<$E> \n\n Uh uhm antibiotics   \n\n\nSir\n\n<$A> \n\nIn the meantime what you can get from the nurse are lozenges\n\n\nWe have some lozenges that will allay the pain\n\n<$E> \n\nHow about the certificate\n\n<$A> \n\nCertificate, for what\n\n\nCertificate for what\n\n<$E> \n\nSir I 'll be excused from my quiz in my subject\n\n<$A> \n\nYou have one more subject\n\n<$E> \n\nActually, I have a class\n\n<$A> \n\nUh you go to your doctor right away  ha  \n\n<$E> \n\nSir so would this be valid, I don't know\n\n<$A> \n\nAn absence is an absence, \n\n<$E> \n\nUh Sir how about the\n\n<$A> \n\nAlthough this is uh, I suppose this will justify your\nbeing absent but you 're still absent\n\n<$E> \n\nYeah, yes, so you 're going  \n\n<$A> \n\nYes, before you leave you ask for a, a lozenge from the\nnurse  ha  and then see your doctor right away, okay  \n\n<$F> \n\nAnd what and we would like to uh make an interview about uhm\nthe thing, the things that uh that surrounds us our health and, uhm\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nThe common, the common layman 's belief is even hepatitis\nB is  ang kamalian nila  they think if you have hepatitis B it 's\nfatal\n\n\nIt 's not fatal, only less than five percent die of the disease\n\n\nEven hepatitis B even hepatitis more so in A\n\n\nA is the mild form, usually they  'yon atang pumatay, \nnaku sira yata 'yong ano yong tinape yon ba, ewan ko kung yan  \n\n\nIt 's not a fatal disease\n\n\nWhat makes it serious especially hepatitis B is, statistics\nwill show you that if you have had hepatitis B especially B  ha\n\n although A is included twenty to twenty-five years later twenty-five\npercent will develop liver cancer or liver cirrhosis\n\n\nThese are incurable diseases, in other words you die\n\n<$F> \n\nHmmmh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo in other words if you have a history of hepatitis A or B\nmore so in B\n\n\nOne out of five will develop eventually later in life twenty or\nthirty years later they will develop liver carcinoma or or uh liver cirrhosis\n\n\nThese are fatal diseases\n\n\nSo that 's what makes it serious, that 's what makes it serious\n\n<$F> \n\nIs it incurable\n\n<$A> \n\nNot, cirrhosis is a liver disease that 's incurable\n\n\nCancer is incurable  di ba  \n\n\nCancer is well cancer is curable there 's a  mistaken\nbelief that cancer is not curable\n\n\nCancer is curable but the point is you 've got to catch it at the\nbeginning at the start\n\n<$F> \n\nTumor\n\n<$A> \n\nBut usually uh cancer you you only spot it or you discover it\nwhen it 's already in the advanced stage\n\n<$F> \n\nBenign\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause usually if it 's beginning you don't exhibit any\nsymptoms so you will not know you have it\n\n\nUh  karamihan lang nasi-  save  na kanser sa\nbabae kasi ang sa babae madaling ma-  discover  e, kagaya\nng kanser ng  breast  nakakapa mo yan kapag may maliit na\nbukol  \n\n\n Ang sa lalaki nasa loob paano mo mapa, palagay mo\n\n cancer of the lungs  paano mo makakapa kung maliit lang\n\n \n\n\n Wala ka namang

hospitalized\n\n\nBut recently I got better until, the last past day\n\n<$B> \n\nUh with regards to your difficulty of breathing now do you\nhave accompanying symptoms like cough fever, or sweat uh night chills\n\n\nUh do you have it\n\n<$A> \n\nNo   uh  simple breathing problem\n\n<$B> \n\n When   when you were hospitalized last November\nwhat uh laboratory parameters were done to you\n\n<$A> \n\nWell I had uh an X-ray and then uh, uh I I don't recall if\nmy blood was taken and then I had an X-ray\n\n<$B> \n\nUh huh, what was your blood pressure then\n\n<$A> \n\nI think it was normal\n\n<$B> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$A> \n\nBut Uh I I remember they took my uh my  a a\nbreathing test\n\n\nMaybe they they counted how many times uh what my pulse rate was\nbut I don't recall anymore\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-hmmmh, so what was your blood pressure then\n\n<$A> \n\nI think it was normal  'no  about a hundred\nforty to ninety only\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay I have to   examine your chest

chest\n\n\nSo it looks like you 're still having some episodes of asthma, \n\n\nYour heart looks okay, regular heart beat, breathing okay\n\n\nSo we 'll still consider this is still an asthma\n\n\nOh I 'll give you what what medications did you take in   \nwhat medications  \n\n<$A> \n\n I am taking Budesonide   initial spray and mouth\nuh medication\n\n<$B> \n\nLike what\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's like a

{"text": "<$A> \n\nOkay okay Melanie, please sit over here and let me take that\nseat over there\n\n\nSo what we 're going to do today is to fit your new contact lenses\n\n\nI 'll also be teaching you the proper way to handle to handle your\nnew lenses\n\n<$B> \n\nDoc would it hurt I mean the lenses would it hurt\n\n<$A> < ICE-PHI:#> Well maybe a little at first but you 'll get used to it after\nawhile\n\n\nI guess what you should expect when I first insert the contact lens\nis that you would feel like as if a dust particle has entered your eye\n\n para ka lang napuwing  \n\n\nYou would feel tears in your eyes and may be a little dazzled by\nlight\n\n<$B> \n\nIt sounds worst than what I 'm going through with the glasses\nright now\n\n<$A> \n\nActually what you would experience is the normal reaction of\nour eyes\n\n\nIt 's our sort of protective mechanism but it would only be\ntemporary, there 's nothing to worry about\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nNow the first thing you should do is learn how to insert and\nremove your contact lenses\n\n\nSince I prescribed you with uh daily wear contact lens, you\nshould remove it clean it every night, \n\n\nLet me show you how to insert your contact lens\n\n\nOkay first thing is uh you should check if your lens is on the\nright side, this is the way to do it, hold it between your thumb and\nindex finger and hold it like this\n\n\nIf the edges turns away from each other then your lenses are on the\nwrong side, but if it turns over like this it 's on the right side\n\n\nDid you see the difference\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nGood\n\n\nNow if you happen to get the contact lens into your eye while it is\nin on the wrong side don't panic\n\n\nIt would feel uncomfortable so all you have to do is remove it turn\nit to the right side and reinsert it\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nSo let me insert the contact lens first okay\n\n\nNow let 's try it with the right eye, \n\n\nNow what I want you to do is to relax, look straight ahead, \nthat 's it, look a little bit upward okay\n\n\nNow don't blink, there\n\n\nHow does it feel\n\n<$B> \n\nA little weird but everything 's clear when I cover my left\neye\n\n<$A> \n\nMelanie if upon insertion of the contact lens you would feel\nthat your vision is quite blurred what you should do is close your eyes and\nrub your eyelids lightly, like this okay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nNow if vision is still blurred and you feel uncomfortable\nremove the contact lens because most likely there 's something or some sort\nof particle inside your eye\n\n\nSo what you should do is clean your contact lens again before\nre-insertion, you understand\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nSo do you have any question so far regarding the insertion of\nyour contact lens\n\n<$B> \n\nNone\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay, \n\n\nNow I 'll be teaching you how to remove your contact lens then\nlater you 'll have to be uh practicing removal and insertion of your contact\nlens alone, okay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what you 're going to do right now is uh again look\nstraight ahead, \n\n\nNow don't blink, \n\n\nThere we already removed it, \n\n\nHow does it feel\n\n<$B> \n\nFine\n\n<$A> \n\nActually Melanie,  'no  uh having your\noptometrist remove remove your contact lens is very easy  pero\n\n the problem lies in the fact that you have to do it by yourself\n\n di ba  \n\n\n Kasi siyempre alangan naman  I 'll always be there\nto remove and insert  your contact lens, so you 'll have to\nlearn to do it yourself\n\n\nSo what you have to do is when removing your contact lens for the\nright eye you have to use your left hand, okay\n\n\nHold your upper eyelid like this, and using your  \nuh middle finger for the right hand hold your lower eyelid like this\n\n\nNow what you should do is use your thumb and index finger of the\nright hand and pull out the contact lens that 's it\n\n\nDo you think you can do it\n\n<$B> \n\nI think so\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n\nJust relax Melanie\n\n<$B> \n\nIs this the way to do it\n\n<$A> \n\nYes just go on, \n\n<$B> \n\nI can't seem to get it in\n\n<$A> \n\nJust relax and try it again, \n\n\nNow slowly, okay, slowly there\n\n<$B> \n\n Ayan  I got it in\n\n<$A> \n\nNow does it hurt\n\n<$B> \n\nNot really\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay, so is your vision clear\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nIt doesn't feel uncomfortable or anything\n\n<$B> \n\nWell a little but tolerable\n\n<$A> \n\nGood, so basically that 's it\n\n\nSo now you might as well try removing it\n\n\nOkay concentrate, slowly, now pull it up\n\n<$B> \n\nThere\n\n<$A> \n\nGood, now a little more practice and you you 'll be like a\npro\n\n\nI want you to try wearing your contact lens for the for at least\ntwo hours and then increase your wearing schedule by four hours every day\nuntil your eyes can totally accept the contact lens\n\n\nNow be sure to clean your contact lenses every day and everything\nwill be okay\n\n\nNow if you

{"text": "<$A> \n\nUh this will just be an informal meeting uh because the\n\nLasallian Ambassador group is a big group\n\n\nSo we 're about a total of sixty plus close to seventy with the old\nmembers right\n\n\nSo this is my uh way of getting to know everybody or each of one of\nyou personally\n\n\nSo because of my past experiences for the past three years in the\nLasallian Ambassadors I see them come and go and then I really don't know\nthem personally\n\n\nI just know them by face or I just know them by uhm by what they do\nbut not actually personally but how they are what do they do what are their\nstrengths etcetera\n\n\nAnd so since you 're a new member   could  you just\npossibly introduce yourself to me say something a little about yourself\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nUh well uh I 'm a second year Applied Economics and Accountancy\nstudent   uh  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n<$B> \n\nSo actually uh whenever I say my course a lot of the other\nstudents come to a shock but then for me it 's not a very big deal   \n,  because uhm\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nWhy why are they in a shock  \n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know because well the course is challenging   \n,  I find myself really challenged mentally and physically challenged\nwith all the things\n\n\nLike right now I 'm still on my second year and we 're already on\nour major subjects   and  by next year  ,  we 'll\nbe having our thesis for Economics   at the same time  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Already   \n\n<$B> \n\nYes 'cause  ,  because regular uh regular\nApplied Economics degree takes only three years <2{>  and  at the\nsame time we 'll be having our major subjects in Accounting  , \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n<$B> \n\nSo by this time we 're already we 're already struggling\ntrying to adjust to the   academic  \n\n<$A> \n\n Struggling    uh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nWe 're really we really are because some of our classmates\nthey already went back they repeated   the course  or something\nlike that so it 's difficult also to maintain  ,  being a\nregular student\n\n\nSo so for me uhm I don't think they should gasp  ,  \nabout it  ,  \n\n\nThey just like uhm  ,  I chose this course so it 's\nmy choice something like that\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh-huh    \n\n\nBut you like what you 're doing\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I I like the course\n\n<$A> \n\nWhy did you choose the course in the first place\n\n<$B> \n\nUh at first  personally like before I know that my\nline is on the business side because of my family background and so on\n\n\nPlus we have our business\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut then I didn't want uh certain management or degree only\nsomething like that\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nI think it comes with the pride\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh uh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah then I wanted something that would give a name or sort of\n\n\nLike if I took up Accountancy I would someday become a   C P\nA  hopefully\n\n<$A> \n\n C P A   \n\n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah at least there 's a title\n\n\nAnd then for well in high school I appreciated Economics so so one\nday I said that I want it 's either when I go to college it 's either I 'll\ntake up Accounting or Economics\n\n\nIt 's either one of the two\n\n\nBut then  ,  when I saw the application form  from La Salle  ,  it was a combination so unlike\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n\nYes you got the best of both  \n\n<$B> \n\nSo this is great so I just chose it and then I got in\n\n\nSo but\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nI didn't really it wasn't really an aspiration or something\nthat I really wanted to get in this course so I think it was just God 's will\nreally that I got into it\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n\nIn what other organizations are you involved here in school\n\n<$B> \n\nUh currently uhm I am part of the Student Council Office of\nVice-President for Academics\n\n<$A> \n\nAs\n\n<$B> \n\nActually I 'm into uhm team spirit academic grievance\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo what do you do\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm basically we handle cases grievance cases\n\n\nBut then there are not a lot of them\n\n\nMost people like when I was in my freshman year I thought that uh\nthe grievance team was uhm had a terrible job of handling all those cases\nnumerous cases\n\n\nI thought it was very tedious\n\n\nWell the process is tedious\n\n\nBut however these people are the community are is not aware of\ntheir rights\n\n\nBasically they don't know what to do about them\n\n\nSo what we 've been doing what we 've been trying to do is to\ndisseminate this information\n\n<$A> \n\nInformation uh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nOn rights and so on but then uh it 's not that  , \n\n uhm efficient yet because the team is so small because  , \n\n nobody wants to join it\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n because of the work\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nPerceived work\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah perceived work\n\n\nBut then uhm for me it 's not it 's not just the work it 's also\nthe companionship\n\n\nYou get to know other team members\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n\nSo during your stay in the organization what did you get to do\nalready\n\n<$B> \n\nUh actually I 'm in charge of publicity so when 'cause uhm\nevery term every midterm final course card day we set up a booth for students\nto like they come and consult us uh if if they have a problem with the\nprofessor and then if they think uh they would ask if they have a case or not\nso they consult them\n\n\nThen we would guide them but then also the common notion that we\nwant to uh erase is that we are not the ones who will uhm file your cases for\nyou\n\n\nYou have to work on your cases we 're not gonna work on your cases\nwe will just guide you and help you but what happens is they leave that to us\nwhich is a very big problem\n\n<$A> \n\nCorrect correct\n\n<$B> \n\nBut how can we defend you when we don't know everything\n\n<$A> \n\nAbout the case  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah and that what happens is we, example the student is\nnot that cooperative but then we go on with the case uh we approach the\nprofessor and so on we are the ones  who get the blame\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes\n\n<$B> \n\nWe take then we take the blame\n\n<$A> \n\nYou 're you 're caught in the middle  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah we 're caught in the middle\n\n\nThe students think uh they 're not uh they 're not they go like uh\n\n walang silbi ang mga yan gumaganon sila  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh uh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSomething like that so it also hurts in a way\n\n<$A> \n\nCorrect if you 're doing your job and they 're not doing\ntheirs  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nHave you been in actual hearing\n\n<$B> \n\nUh no no not yet\n\n<$A> \n\nNot yet\n\n<$B> \n\nAs of this year I there are no uh  serious\ncases\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then actually those also what we know is that those\npersonal cases like when they say sexual harassment cases they usually uh\nhave them in private\n\n\nSo it doesn't go through us\n\n\nIt goes directly to the higher uh Student   Council  \nofficers and then to the Discipline Office and so on\n\n<$A> \n\n Right   \n\n\nUh-huh uh-huh I see\n\n\nSo aside from your involvement in the Student Council what uh\nother organizations are you involved in\n\n<$B> \n\nActually the other team in uh uhm  academics\ngroup is the Education Expo which has been moved and moved because of a lot\nof circumstances\n\n<$A> \n\nUh this is with the foreign countries foreign schools\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah external linkages\n\n\nAnd hopefully it will push through in March\n\n<$A> \n\nMarch\n\n<$B> \n\nFirst week of March\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nSo every now and then we had meetings  ganon  \nso on how to prepare for it\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n\nWhat is your role in that committee\n\n<$B> \n\nUh actually I 've been assigned as the assistant coordinator\nand then uh\n\n<$A> \n\nOhhh\n\n\nSo as assistant coordinator what will you be doing\n\n<$B> \n\nI will I will really be uh hands-on supposedly on the event\nitself because the preparation itself has we 're not that part of it because\nthe External Linkages  uh handled it\n\n\nThey said that they will handle everything 'cause they have the\ncontacts  ,  \n\n\nSo it 's also hard for just plain students to approach these\nEmbassies so we have to they have to back us up\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh I see   \n\n\nCourse it through External Linkages\n\n<$B> \n\nSo they did that work for us\n\n\nSo then our work would be on the event itself   the guests\ntheir  food their uh the seminar rooms yeah basically logistics\n\n<$A> \n\n More on taking care of the guests   \n\n\nTheir needs\n\n\nI see\n\n\nSo aside from the Student Council any other organization since\nfreshman\n\n<$B> \n\nUh J PIA  \n\n<$A> \n\nJ PIA  ,  member\n\n<$B> \n\nSince it 's our org  \n\n\nYeah then this year uh I got into the publications so I 'm the\nnews editor\n\n<$A> \n\nOh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo once in a while we go to the events and we write about\nabout them\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n\nWhat made you choose the Lasallian Ambassador group\n\n\nWhy did you join us\n\n<$B> \n\nBasically because uh\n\n<$A> \n\nDid you join did you did you have the intention to join since\nyou were in your first year\n\n\nOr just now or\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I wanted to\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n\nWhy\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause I think it was a chance and you also get to know a\nlot of people\n\n\nI didn't uh I wasn't aware of all the activities of\n\n\nThe main activity I know is the L-Pep\n\n<$A> \n\nL-Pep\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah and then the other activities I I know that I don't know\ntrainings and all but then the other other activities I wasn't that aware of\nthem until I got inside\n\n<$A> \n\nLike\n\n<$B> \n\nUh like all the first activities like the Christmas  \nsalo-salo  that you 'll be the one serving\n\n<$A> \n\nYes uh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah then the ushering\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nI wasn't that aware of them\n\n<$A> \n\nThat there are other activities uh-huh uh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah so\n\n<$A> \n\nHow do you find the Ambassador group so far\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah they 're okay\n\n\nUhm they 're a fun group\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I guess if you if you don't have that much confidence if\nyou if you don't get to talk to a lot of people how can you talk to your\norientees during the L-Pep which is very important since you 're welcoming\nthem into the Lasallian community as a representative of your school uh\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh uh-huh\n\n\nSo basically you 're doing P R work for the school\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's why you 're called Ambassadors that 's why we choose\ngood people so as in about a hundred or hundred plus or two hundred plus who\napplied we only get seventy seventy or sixty 'cause we make sure we also get\nthe best\n\n\nAt least those who could project good of our University  di\nba  \n\n\nSo what are you looking for in an organization\n\n<$B> \n\nUh actually\n\n<$A> \n\nLike what do you think could you get from the Ambassador\ngroup that you wouldn't be able to get in some other groups  \n\n di ba  \n\n\nWhy the hassle of going through the tedious process of screening\n\n \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I well I didn't really know how hard it was to get in\nuntil I was there\n\n\nYou have to be you have to be mentally prepared also with all\nthose  what do you call it uhm they 're they 're sort of the\nchallenges\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm I think it was okay even though some of them were funny\n\n<unclear> 1 word </unclear> somewhat stupid but then it 's low confidence\nlevel that you get to build up yeah and then we also got to experience some\nof my friends got to experience it 'cause I celebrated my debut last July\n\n<$A> \n\nOh you did\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah so we had uhm we really had a director who taught us and\nthen he really taught   us  how to uhm be more confident of\nourselves\n\n\nSo he would let you uhm he would really let you walk down those 'cause\nwe practiced on the top on the roof top of our condo unit so every some of\nthe residents would come up every now and then\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n( laughs) To look and watch  \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd they would see us and it 's really  it 's\nreally embarrassing to see them  ,  look at you when you 're\nwalking down uh as if you 're modeling especially the guards when they know\nyou  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but then that helped uhm on the event itself because you\nwon't really mind all those people anymore\n\n\nYou wouldn't be bowing your head\n\n\nSo you would uh look straight and be more be more confident since\nuh you 're  it 's like you 're presenting yourself\n\n\nFor me it wasn't just my debut it was everyone 's all my  debut those who participated because we 're all part of it\n\n\nSo it wasn't just it wasn't just me because my all my friends my\nfamily all those close to me\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n\nSo that 's what you 're looking for in an organization\n\n\nSomething that would help you develop yourself in terms of\nconfidence\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n\nWell not only that   uhm  I think it 's very important\nto know a lot of people like I 've seen it in my parents when they\nestablished their business\n\n<$A> \n\n Oh what else   \n\n\nUh-huh their networks\n\n<$B> \n\nYes  \n\n\nBecause my Mom used to work in a bank so she did have a lot of\nnetworks\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom her high school and college friends her colleagues and\nshe knew a lot of people\n\n\nAlso my Dad\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo the through those people that they knew they were able to\nbe more successful in their fields\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah and then they were also able to build their reputations\n\n\nEven though a lot of I guess it 's normal to have rivalries\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then some people have uhm they 're just insecure uhm and\nall those\n\n\nEven though a lot of people tried to destroy them but then they\nhad the credibility they had their reputation  ,  \n\n\nSo it wasn't easy it 's not easy to destroy that\n\n\nSo that 's like for me that 's what  ,  they 've\nbeen teaching us all throughout these years\n\n\nThat uhm no matter what happens you know that you 're right you\nknow what is right and wrong and you know what you should do\n\n\nSo for me uh I try I 'm trying to build my reputation\n\n\nI got I think I have already uh in my credibility\n\n<$A> \n\n Correct   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nAnd you 're just trying to build up your network so it could be\nbetter known  \n\n\nI guess probably you 'll be able to get that 'cause De La Salle\nAmbassador group uh especially the core work with the administrators and\nfaculty\n\n\nProbably during your uhm working here you 'll get to meet uhm well\nmost of the people who work also in the University okay\n\n\nOf course they will be asking you to coordinate for us coordinate\nwith different offices coordinate with the administrators\n\n\nSo hopefully you would be able to have that okay if you 'll be\nactive with our group  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nHow long do you plan to be with us\n\n\nYou 're you 're you 're going to be here for about two more years\n\n<$B> \n\nI have three more\n\n<$A> \n\nThree more years\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah I 'll be graduating in two thousand six\n\n<$A> \n\nTwo thousand six\n\n<$B> \n\nStill a long way\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I 'm hoping that you 'll stay with us all throughout your\nstay hopefully if you like the group of course  \n\n\nAnd what else would you like to know about the Ambassador group\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know  \n\n<$A> \n\nUhm there will be there will be five committees in the\nAmbassador group\n\n\nEach committee will be headed by a core\n\n\nWe have the publicity and marketing uh publicity group\n\n\nWe have the logistics group\n\n\nThe logistics group takes care of all the physical arrangements\nfor our activities from campus tours to ushering to coordinating writing\nletters uhm what else  uh reserving rooms or areas that we\nhave to use\n\n\nSo basically the bulk of the work during L-Pep that is theirs\n\n\nWe have the H R D human resource and development committee they\ncare they take care of uh manpower take care of training of the Ambassadors\nwhatever the Ambassadors need to develop in terms of skill uhm they make sure\nthat uh these needs are given to them or addressed\n\n\nAnd then we have the marketing and finance committee\n\n\nThey take care of solicitation and handling the budget for L-Pep\n\n\nAnd then we have the documentations team\n\n\nThey 're documentations and research\n\n\nThey produce the Lasallian Ambassadors Manual and uhm they make\nsure that the contents are updated 'cause every year we have new information\nthe people change the officers change departments change even the physical\nstructure of the schools change\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo we have to change the what do you call this the maps the\nmaps once in a while because of the additional of one building  a building disappears or another classroom appears or whatever\n\n\nSo we have five committees that you get to choose from\n\n\nSo given probably your skills or what you 're good at what what\ncommittee do you think would you be more uhm where will you be more what do\nyou call this used or maximized\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm I 'm not sure yet  \n\n<$A> \n\nYou 're not sure yet  \n\n\nLike you 've been in publicity right you 've been in publicity  \n\n,  in your other involvements and you 're good in Math so maybe you\nhave a choice between what publicity or marketing and finance\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah",

\n\n\nSo I was so glad\n\n<$A> \n\n  Oo    \n\n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n So many paper work  ha  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah so many paper work then there was the midterms   \n,  those stuff and everything  ,  \n\n\nI was glad that first I learned the results from the shifting  \n\n,  that I was able to shift\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n<$B> \n\nLike we were only four shiftees from uh external shiftees to\nAccounting then only three of us made it to shift  ,  to the\ncourse\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\nUh-uhm\n\n\nWhy why why did you want to shift\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's my interest\n\n\nIt 's like during the L-Pep during the L-Pep I was asking the\nLasallian Ambassador uh how how do you do shifting  ,  \n\n\nThat 's what that 's that that was my first question because\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nWas that was that your first choice your first choice\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah it was my first choice but then La Salle wasn't my first\nchoice then for a school\n\n<$A> \n\nAhh I see\n\n\nWhat was your first choice\n\n<$B> \n\nIt was U P\n\n<$A> \n\nU P\n\n\nWhat happened at U P  \n\n<$B> \n\nLike everyone so I didn't get in I didn't  \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay okay\n\n<$B> \n\nChances are if I passed I 'd probably get <unclear> 1 word\n\n</unclear>  Floating  Technology there or something so I 'm glad I\ndidn't\n\n\nAnd right now I 'm here in La Salle with Ambassadors and everything\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo then what happened next was that I I was then I shift I was\nable to shift and then I learned the results from the internet  , \n\n that I passed then that 's it\n\n\nRight now I 'm an irreg  student  , \n\n I get to meet different people\n\n\nThen I 'm glad that I 'm with the Ambassadors because once in a\nwhile I could say \" hi \" to people and  ,  \nsay \" hi hello \" \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\nWhat are your other involvements in school other organizations\n\n<$B> \n\nUh actually I also joined J PIA\n\n\nSo I was the only Communication Arts student who was\n\n<$A> \n\nIn J PIA  \n\n<$B> \n\nIn J PIA  \n\n\nI really wanted Accounting so during the we had this  , \n\n General Assembly\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nAssembly\n\n<$B> \n\nThen what happened was that uh people like uh uh introduce\nyourself so \" hello \" I 'm  ganyan ganyan  B\nS A I 'm like this B S A\n\n\nThen I 'm like I 'm Communication Arts Business Management   \n,  so  parang  uh okay so that 's it\n\n\nSo I 'm glad I 'm B S A also so I could mingle with them so\n\n<$A> \n\n    So you 're you 're just a plain\nmember in J PIA\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah plain member  din  for  Tapat\n\n but I 'm inactive\n\n<$A> \n\nInactive\n\n\nWhy did you join  Tapat  \n\n<$B> \n\nUh principles I guess\n\n\nI don't know it 's like it 's\n\n<$A> \n\nDo you find yourself uh further involved in  Tapat\n\n 's activities\n\n<$B> \n\nHopefully but then I don't know where to start  , \n\n \n\n\nLike right now I my priorities are more in school with the\nrequirements  ,  and everything\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\n Uh-uhm    \n\n\nJust let her wait\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that 's it I guess  \n\n<$A> \n\nWhat activities would you like to be involved in  Tapat\n\n \n\n<$B> \n\n Tapat  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-uhm what what found the what did you find interesting in\n\n Tapat  \n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's their view of being quite leaning on the left side\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know I think they have this thing and then during the\nNEAT activity they  ,  also made this presentation which there\nwere points given that I quite agree on it\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\nUh-uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nLike  student things like that and  , \n\n then and sometimes I guess maybe in second year and the third\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\nUh-uhm and what was your reason for joining the Ambassador group\n\n<$B> \n\nThe reason why I joined actually for it 's just that I wanted\nto do something and during my stay in La Salle the fact that I was I was\nalready here  ,  \n\n\nThen I saw the uhm application dates then actually I wasn't able to\npass during the regular time it 's like, they extended  ,  \nthat was the time I was able to pass it\n\n\nActually I didn't I didn't quite expect  ,  to make\nit with all the difficult   interviews  \n\n\nYou know I mean I was so glad that I was able but the reason why I\njoined because I like to meet people  ,  I like to meet uh\nlike  ano  other students and then what I like what I wrote in\nmy essay I said that I like to give back what I learned or what I experienced\nduring my L  L-Pep which was\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Requirements    \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nWhy what did you experience  \n\n<$B> \n\nIt was nice because I got the chance to bond with other people\n\n ,  and then there was then I saw the Lasallian Ambassadors\nlike fun people because during the last part isn't it there 's a culminating\nactivity for all the Ambassadors\n\n\nThey were like dancing  paikot    \n\n,  so  parang  wow  galing tapos parang\n\n you get to be a teacher for two days  ,  \n\n\nSo be the big guy\n\n\nI don't know\n\n\nThat 's why I wanted to join\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\nDo you think you 'd be good in teaching\n\n<$B> \n\nNo     \n\n\nI have a phobia phobia for  ano  \n\n<$A> \n\n No    \n\n\nPhobia for what\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause I 'm a student myself and I know like for example  \nMina Barok  there 's this teacher who 's from Visayas who who has an\naccent\n\n\nSo chances are people would mimic it  parang ganon  \nwill try to  ,   ano  \n\n\nBasically it 's the student relation\n\n\nI don't know if I could  ano  manage it\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-uhm uh-uhm   \n\n\nBut that 's part of the requirement for bring an Ambassador  \n\n to have the facility  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah yeah I know   that 's what I want to get\nover in I mean to learn to learn the\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-uhm\n\n\nAnd then what else what else are you looking for in an\norganization\n\n\nProbably one of the reasons why you chose the Ambassador group\n\n<$B> \n\nSomething that 's active that that does something   \n, </1> unlike for you know for some professional orgs  like there you give you just pay the  ano  for being  \n\n, a membership  fee\n\n\nYou have this party then that 's it\n\n\nFor the whole year that 's the activity\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Membership fee   \n\n\nUh-uhm uh-uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUnlike here you get to go to the S P S then you have your own\n\n tambayan  those I  ,  guess would that 's nice\n\n ano  \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n\nHow how do you find the Ambassador group so far\n\n<$B> \n\nFun we keep on laughing     then\nalthough\n\n<$A> \n\n Fun uh-huh   \n\n\nHave you been with us during our past activities   the\n\n salu-salo   \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah <unclear> words </unclear>   \n\n<$A> \n\nHave you attended some of the campus tours orientation\n\n<$B> \n\nUh there was a campus tour yesterday  ,  but my\nfirst class was one o'clock so I just\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n the Catanduanes group didn't you you\nweren't able to join that\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat 's that\n\n<$A> \n\nWe also had a campus tour for a group of students  , \n\n from the State College in Catanduanes\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh I was   \n\n\nUh no\n\n<$A> \n\nNot yet\n\n\nSo this is the first activity that you were able to join was the\n\n salu-salo sa <unclear> 2 words </unclear>  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah then the  ,  turn-over\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   and the turn-over\n\n\nSo aside from them being fun\n\n<$B> \n\nThey 're  ano  confident  ,  \n\n\nImagine to handle all those people\n\n<$A> \n\n They 're confident   \n\n\nPeople who you don't know\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah and then it 's only you it 's only you\n\n\nThen those stuff  parang  it  takes a\nlot of guts\n\n\nI mean  parang  the Ambassadors itself it 's hard\nwith all the interviews the things you have to do and then you have to act\nyou have to do this\n\n\nI remember there was this question during the interview \" \n\n Ba't bilog ang  manhole \"  ,  \n\n\n Parang  they asked me that  \n\n\n Ha  I don't know\n\n\nAnd then there was also another question like \" How come\nthe sheep in Baa Baa Black Sheep is  ano  black \" \n\n\n Parang bakit  black  ang  sheep\n\n sa  \" Baa Baa Black Sheep \" \n\n\n Parang kasi  it 's for kids so kids usually use uh\n\n ano  same letters  \" Baa Baa Black\nSheep \" so it 's supposed to be all letter B\n\n\nOr they make all sorts of suggestions what if there was never a\nlamb  parang  there was there was never a sheep throughout\nhistory what would be the animal like\n\n<$A> \n\n Parang   \n\n\nYou know the reason for that what was the reason for asking those\nquestions\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nThey just wanted  ano  get you a  card  \n\n\nAnd then they asked that in between several serious questions  \n\n right  \n\n<$B> \n\nRight  so   \n\n<$A> \n\nSo they they were just trying you on whether you\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I kept   on answering  \n\n<$A> \n\n You kept on answering    \n\n<$B> \n\nThe first thing that comes to my mind I answer it because it 's\n\n\nBut they also made me shout in on the top of a chair \" \nScreaming Darna \" pretending that there was fire\n\n<$A> \n\nHow how did you find the screening\n\n<$B> \n\nIt was hard\n\n\nBefore the screening I was actually planning to not take it\nanymore  ,  because I 've I 've heard from the other people\nwho 've done it  ,  their their term was  katay\n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nWhat\n\n<$B> \n\n Katay  \n\n<$A> \n\n Katay  what do you mean by \"  \nkatay  \" \n\n<$B> \n\n Parang  you have to go through  \ntalagang  super  hirap   ,  because\nfor other for other I think organizations just like ones the ones the\nAmbassadors is like one of the hardest  ,  I don't know for\nfor them\n\n<$A> \n\n  Oo oo    \n\n\n Uh I see   \n\n\nBecause we want to get the best     \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   of course\n\n<$A> \n\n Oo  we only get the best and the most\nconfident\n\n\nBecause if you don't have the basic skills to start off with  \n\n,  we 'll be having   a  difficult time   \ntraining you  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\n Yeah   \n\n\n Training them    di ba  \n\n<$A> \n\nYes at least we have to have the basics the foregrounder\nwhich we could work on\n\n<$B> \n\nLike what what are\n\n<$A> \n\nLike we we we would like to have people at least a certain\nlevel of confidence already   because  if from the very start\nthey 're already   shy  we 'll be having a difficult time\ntraining them\n\n\nWe only have a short time to train them before L-Pep  , \n\n \n\n\nWell actually on the way uh you 'll be more enhanced in terms of\nuh being confident and having the skills, \n\n\nBut we want to have at least something to work on  , \n\n \n\n\nSo with the people we have right now at least we 're confident\nthat we got uh that well the cream of the crop  the best  \n\n,  \n\n\nSo you 're one of the best all right\n\n\nUh we see that all of you have potential uh  ,  \n\n however uh we would like to make you better\n\n\nSo therefore we 'll be requiring you to attend all the trainings\n\n\nRight now you 've been accepted as an Ambassador  , \n\n however you have to earn the title  ,  \n\n\nYou have to earn the title of being an Ambassador for completing\nall the requirements meaning the trainings the meetings because uhm in our\nexperience there have been several students who applied   and then\n\n but after that they weren't able to attend several  , \n\n training sessions\n\n\nWhich is unfair because some of them uhm well almost all of them\nwent through with all the training sessions\n\n\nAnd I think it 's very important that for you to be able to be a\ngood Ambassador you 'll have to have the skills and to be knowledgeable of\nwhatever things that we 're supposed to do\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh which are   \n\n\n Shy   \n\n\n Yeah   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Uh for the   \n\n\n Thank you   that 's nice\n\n\n Thank you   \n\n\n So   \n\n\n But then   \n\n\n Trainings   \n\n\nUh so what 's the training all about\n\n<$A> \n\nUh it 's all about the skills that you have to give for being\nan Ambassador   how to be diplomatic  \n\n<$B> \n\nAhh   game setting    \n\n<$A> \n\nUh aside from that how to be diplomatic how to facilitate, \neffective presentation skills  ,  how to be more confident\nwhat is the proper way of dealing with guests uh the do 's and don'ts of being\nwith guests  ,  uhm what else\n\n\nEvents management is also part of it because I also delegate\nprojects to Ambassadors for them to handle\n\n\nAnd then I what I do is just supervise because this is a\npreparation for uhm what do you call this your profession\n\n\nAfter you graduate  ,  you 'll be asked to handle\nprojects\n\n\nYou 'll be asked to uh talk in front of people you 'll be asked to\nuh what do you call this speak in front of a big group\n\n\nSo I think that 's what uh we value in terms of skill more on\npublic relations\n\n\nSo we hope we could what do you call this we could create more\nconfident public relations people for the University uhm with the Ambassadors\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh   \n\n\n Uh yeah   \n\n\n Uh <unclear> words   </unclear> \n\n\n Pero  it 's nice that we 're called Ambassadors\n\n ,  compared to before Orientors\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nOrientors because the Orientors only just work for L-Pep   \nduring  the freshmen during the freshman orientation\n\n<$B> \n\n For L-Pep   \n\n\n Pero  it 's tedious during before the L-Pep\n\n<$A> \n\nYes  it 's tedious before and during L-Pep\nand a little after probably especially for the Logistics group", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

pesos\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nProject plan okay\n\n\nUh you 're Angela\n\n<$A> \n\nYes I 'm Angela\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah, uhm projected income statement\n\n\nUh you 've already coordinated with Rockwell regarding the venue\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nThey 've told you about the capacity one thousand\n\n<$C> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nYes we 've already seen it we 've already seen the place\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay entrance ticket how much per ticket\n\n\nIs it a closed venue isn't the car park  medyo  open\n\n<$A> \n\nWell it 's open\n\n<$B> \n\nSo how how can you control the the crowd\n\n<$A> \n\nWell there 's one entrance  lang  for the cars\n\n\nSo maybe  yun yung  entrance  na  we 'll\nuse it as entrance\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nI mean I mean the the show the stage\n\n\nWill it be open to other people so even if you don't go inside\nwouldn't the people be able to see it\n\n<$A> \n\nUh  kasi  it 's like, this is the car park\nand then at the end of it at the two sides just like there 's a small land or\nsomething it 's like grass so it 'll be like enclosing the place\n\n<$C> \n\nUh-uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd it has uh I think a wall on the side of a building so\n\n<$B> \n\nSo your target solicitation will just be fifty thousand\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah, 'cause we 'll be getting a lot of uh revenues from the\ntickets\n\n<$B> \n\nSouvenir program what 's the souvenir program for\n\n<$A> \n\nUh just for the sponsors we 'll put in the local sponsors and\ndescriptions of the models just in case anyone would like to know\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay the venue do you have uh the a MOA between Rockwell\nregarding the venue\n\n<$C> \n\nUh\n\n<$A> \n\nUh not yet 'cause it 's tentative\n\n<$C> \n\nTentatively reserved for us  na pero  we 're\njust waiting for the approval  kasi  we don't want\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so I 'll be needing to ask you a copy just a copy so it\nhasn't it doesn't need to be signed yet\n\n<$A> \n\nUh yeah we have one\n\n<$B> \n\nWe just need to see to see something from Rockwell showing\nthat they are really charging you thirty thousand pesos\n\n<$A> \n\nNo actually  kasi  the thirty thousand is still\nnegotiable\n\n<$C> \n\n Oo  \n\n<$A> \n\nSince and we 're waiting for the approval  para\n\n we can transact  na  \n\n<$B> \n\nSo  wala pang  there 's no specific amount yet\nhow much  yung  venue\n\n<$A> \n\nBut the maximum\n\n<$B> \n\nThe maximum is thirty thousand\n\n<$A> \n\nYes thirty thousand\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it 's it 's okay even even if you 'll uh be able to\nnegotiate for a lower just show us the copy\n\n<$A and $C> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm stage design <unclear> 1 word </unclear> and sounds\ntickets tokens\n\n\nYour total expense will be sixty-two\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nUh did you include okay here it is <unclear> 1 word </unclear> \nhas seventy-five thousand this doesn't include yet what you 're going to get\nfor the\n\n<$C> \n\n Stephen Speaks  \n\n<$A> \n\n I don't know\n\n<$B> \n\n The  Stephen Speaks  proposal also\nindicated seventy-five thousand\n\n\nSo I guess this would be reasonable\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> 1 word </unclear> has forty thousand\n\n\nSo how much is that\n\n\nHundred\n\n<$A> \n\nOne hundred fifteen\n\n<$C> \n\nOne hundred fifteen\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd your expense is\n\n<$A> \n\nSixty-two thousand that 's more than enough\n\n<$B> \n\nSixty-two\n\n\nThat 's about just half so it 's okay\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nAlright ten percent will go to  SCAP  forty-five to Eco\nforty-five to C B E\n\n\nOkay uh can, I need to have the paper actually signed\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay  \n\n<$B> \n\nYou can't print the signatures\n\n<$C> \n\nWe have  na kasi yung  signed  kaya lang\n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nWe didn't have the logo\n\n<$C> \n\nWe didn't bring the logo so we 'll ask  na lang\n\n to sign we 'll ask them to sign again\n\n<$B> \n\nSo if they could just countersign here so you shouldn't be\ndoing this printing the signatures\n\n\nOkay so this is okay this is good\n\n\nThis is your solicitation letter\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah and this is the program\n\n<$B> \n\nThe program\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd this is the memorandum of agreement between the\n\n<$C> \n\nTwo colleges\n\n<$A> \n\nBetween the two colleges\n\n<$B> \n\nSo each of you would be giving fifty thousand\n\n<$A> \n\nNo twenty-five thousand\n\n<$B> \n\nUh twenty-five\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah sponsorship\n\n<$B> \n\nUh so this means that uh each assembly should be getting\ntwenty-five thousand sponsorship\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\n Kasi  'cause uh the way you write you wrote\nthis it seems that you 're giving twenty-five thousand from your funds\n\n<$A> \n\nBut in case uh sorry\n\n<$B> \n\nSo just try to rephrase this uh each party should be uh how\ndo you\n\n<$A> \n\nRephrase\n\n<$C> \n\nGet solicitations\n\n<$B> \n\nSolicitations worth twenty-five thousand pesos\n\n\nSo uh I thought there were only one thousand tickets\n\n<$A> \n\nUh sorry it was uh  nagkamali ako   \n\n<$B> \n\nSo is this supposed to be five hundred or is this supposed to\nbe one five\n\n<$A> \n\nFive hundred\n\n<$B> \n\nFive hundred\n\n<$A> \n\nSorry I was thinking of something else\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> 2 words </unclear> not sell so all the five hundred\nis considered sold\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that means, five hundred tickets uh one thousand\ntickets hmm, okay 'cause I 'm thinking uh when when you indicate that\ntickets are considered sold that you should reflect as your expense\n\n<$A> \n\nUh as expense on on us\n\n<$B> \n\nYes so this is just going to be cancelled out when you sell\nit\n\n<$C> \n\nSixty-two\n\n<$B> \n\nCorrect\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay sixty-two\n\n<$B> \n\nSixty-two so three sixty-two\n\n<$A> \n\nFifty-five minus sixty-two negative income, net loss  \n\n<$B> \n\nUhm don't you have expenses for the bands\n\n<$A> \n\nUh we 'll be getting   amateur  \n\n<$C> \n\n Amateur   amateur bands\n\n<$B> \n\nAmateur bands\n\n<$A> \n\nUsually it 's free\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah 'cause they 're just starting\n\n<$A> \n\nIt depends actually if we have\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't think amateur bands are, play for free\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah we 'll hold out like new students you know\n\n<$B> \n\nBut but how how would you be able to market the activity if\nyou 're just going to to play amateur bands\n\n<$A> \n\nWell the the amateur bands they 'll be performing for the\nintermission numbers of the fashion show but they 're really what the\nstudents would go for I think is partly the fashion show and the open house\nparty\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's the party\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah it 's the party afterwards\n\n<$C> \n\nActually it depends uh if we\n\n<$B> \n\nUh okay okay\n\n\nBecause I 'm thinking that part of uh or the tickets would be you\nwould have to pay some other organization\n\n\nSo basically all of the uhm revenues from the ticket sales would\ngo back to you\n\n<$A and $C> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you don't have to share it with other with any other\norganization\n\n<$A and $C> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay okay the MOA 's good\n\n\nNow is it possible if you you also show the list of prospective\nsponsors\n\n<$A> \n\nUh okay\n\n<$B> \n\n Uhm try\nto rephrase this because I don't think it sounds so good when when you write\nin your letter like we would like to request for your financial help\n\n\nSo instead uh try to say that uh we would like to invite you to be\none of the partners of this activity\n\n\nSo, yours truly uh you need to\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah okay\n\n<$B> \n\nAside from that you also need to add uhm additional uhm\npeople to sign\n\n\nSo let 's get from Nins and Mr Kalaw from the Alumni Office\n\n<$A and $C> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nDo you do you know other names\n\n<$A and $C> \n\nNo\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay I 'll write down\n\n<$C> \n\nThat 's under \" noted by \" or\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah actually if if you want you can yeah you can have uh\njust one person sign the solicitation letter\n\n\nSo whoever will be the head of all the solicitations can you can\nlet just one person sign\n\n\nSo although you can still provide the contact details of the other\npeople uh so under \" noted by \" Ms Kit Mrs Monina Banaynal\ndo you know what D S A stands for\n\n<$A> \n\n De La Salle\n\n<$B> \n\nDean of Student Affairs so I 'll just write D S A okay\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then Mr Kalaw, Vice-President for Development and\nAlumni Affairs\n\n\nOkay now uhm when I show this to Ms Kit she might uhm make\nadditional comments or revisions on the letter\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nAlthough she 's not around today\n\n\nSo the next time you return this that 's the only time she 'll be\nable to check the letter\n\n\nSponsorship <unclear> 1 word </unclear>, uhm we normally don't\nallow room to room campaigns anymore\n\n\nSo it was the decision of the different Deans\n\n\nSo although you can still uh have it during in between classes\n\n pero  but uh during classes you can't ask the teacher for you\nto publicize so don't indicate this anymore\n\n\nThe rooms distribution jingle uhm streamers uhm you can't put up\nstreamers that bear the name of the company or the product only\n\n\nSo you can only put up streamers that indicate the details of the\nactivity the name of the organizations the details of the activity and you\ncan include the logos of the sponsors but you but uh streamers of sponsors\nthat only indicate uh purely their names you can't put that\n\n\nSo you can only put that at the venue\n\n<$A> \n\nAt the venue\n\n<$B> \n\nSelling it 's outside so it 's okay, uhm this is good\nresum\u00e9 of the project heads so just revise this from the other\npackages\n\n\nOkay so now since this is going to be held outside we also need to\nfill out uh the requirements for off-campus activities uhm the off-campus\nactivity form the yellow form the faculty  conforme  form\nso you should have uhm at least one faculty present there\n\n\nUhm you don't need to submit papers anymore  kasi  \nit 's a party\n\n\nUh so faculty off-campus activity form faculty  conforme\n\n form uhm a copy of the map of the venue uh, and the list of\nthe officers going there going to be present there\n\n<$A> \n\nAll\n\n<$B> \n\nAll officers involved\n\n<$C> \n\nIn the project in the project\n\n<$A and $C> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nSo we 'll be able to know who 's responsible for that\nactivity  ,  okay and then just have this signed by uh  A N B\n\n \n\n\nSo they 're going to sign this first before you submit it to us\nokay\n\n<$A> \n\n Officers   \n\n\nSo we have to revise everything uhm the corrections\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah the corrections I I although mostly are okay already uhm\njust the signatures\n\n\nUh this one you need to have this noted by your respective\ntreasurers  ,  that 's it\n\n\nYou just need the revisions and submit it  di ba  \nokay\n\n<$C> \n\n Okay   \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay thank you\n\n<$B> \n\nDo you have any questions\n\n<$A> \n\nNo uh yeah wait  lang  \n\n\nWhen can we see you again\n\n<$B> \n\nAnytime\n\n<$A> \n\nTomorrow\n\n<$B> \n\nAnytime I 'm always here at the office\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay thank you\n\n<$A> \n\nThank you\n\n<$C> \n\nThank you",

 \" no\ndefinite negative \"  sabi ko  I couldn't understand\n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n<$C> \n\n I was assuring her   \n\n\n Sabi ko  Doctor English  yan   \n\n<$B> \n\nLet 's check out your data\n\n<$A> \n\n Oho , \n\n\n Ang ingay nung  air-con\n\n<$B> \n\nThe  ano ho  the mass is not very big but it 's\nnot small   either  \n\n<$A> \n\n Either   yes\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it 's a T two lesion they call it\n\n\nT is tumor size\n\n\nIt 's T one T two T three you are two\n\n<$A> \n\n Opo  \n\n<$B> \n\nThe lymph nodes are negative so that 's favorable   \n,  \n\n\nSo the probability that the tumor has spread elsewhere is not very\nhigh\n\n\nIn that situation if the nodes are negative at most it 's twenty\npercent chance that it has spread\n\n\nYour uhm Estrogen Receptor Assay is positive so this tells us that\nyou will respond to hormonal therapy  ,  \n\n\nSo any hormonal treatment most likely fifty percent chance you will\nrespond to\n\n\nUhm the HER two NEU is strongly positive\n\n\nWe we cannot give a correlation between  the biologic\nnature of the tumor based on HER two NEU\n\n\nThe the best test is still a FISH analysis\n\n\nBut since that test is not available locally or even if it is it 's\nso expensive this is a rough estimate of HER two NEU and you are strongly\npositive\n\n\nThis \" plus three greater than fifty percent \" is\nindirectly telling us that as far as HER two NEU is concerned you are\npositive\n\n\nBut the only correlation we can make with HER two NEU is that if\nthis is positive we can we cannot use mild agents so   hindi\n\n  directly telling us aggressiveness of behavior but those that\nare strongly positive usually do not respond well to mild treatment it has to\nbe strong treatment\n\n\nSo I think this is uh among your your factors is not very good\n\n\nAll the rest <unclear> words </unclear> negative liver negative\nchest X-ray negative bone scan so it looks like you 're clear of everything\noutside except for that the uh tumor has a potential of being quite\naggressive  ,  \n\n\nNumber two there 's another problematic factor also\n\n\nThe basal line of the section is too close is too close to the\ntumor\n\n\nIt 's only point four C M  ,  so it 's very close\nto the base\n\n\nSo in that situation I will worry about local recurrence the\nprobability that just one tumor cell is left there is quite likely\n\n\nSo uh there are quite a number of options for treatment\n\n\nIt can be reasonable it can be reasonable to just put you on a\nhormonal agent\n\n\nYou know that 's one option a hormonal agent\n\n\nNow if you had to let me choose uhm it is either your your choice\nof hormonal agents will be either Tamoxifen or Arimidex either of the two\n\n\nNow Tamoxifen is the gold standard uhm but it it has side effects\nlike proneness to  uterine cancer and increased risk of strokes\n\n\nThat 's where Arimidex would come\n\n\nArimidex is a relatively new drug\n\n\nThe studies show now it has a slight advantage over Tamoxifen\n\n\nBut this is on a short-term basis  pa lang  because\nit is a new study\n\n\nWe do not know the long-term effect  I mean  the long-term\nefficiency as we know of Tamoxifen\n\n\nSo short of of assuring you that the the response will be\nsustained in the next five years I cannot assure you with Arimidex\n\n\nBut we just know that on a short-term basis it 's better than\nTamoxifen, little bit <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nNow the second option is for you to undergo chemotherapy\n\n\nI think that is that is the uh option one would take if he really\nwants to be ten twenty steps ahead of the whole situation\n\n\nBecause even in lymph node-negative patients it 's acceptable to\nhave chemotherapy because of the  the twenty percent\nprobability still of recurrence despite you know negative nodes  , \n\n \n\n\n<unclear> words </unclear> yes just to cover up for deficiency in\nthe uh the uh assessment tests that we have\n\n\nSo as I said it 's the ultimate\n\n\nIf you are a person who who wants to use all the biggest bullets\nup front that 's the option you take\n\n\nThat 's George W Bush  ,   \n\n\n Hindi yung talagang    George  \n\n yung sa kanya yung sigurista siya  \n\n\nI 'm going to do everything now because I 'm gonna win now\n\n\nI 'm not going to wait until later\n\n\nI 'm not very sure if I will win if I will wait later\n\n\n Yan ang  George W Bush  ,  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n<$C> \n\n Uh-uhm   \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Negative nodes   \n\n\n Aggressive   \n\n\n  Oho    \n\n\n Approach   \n\n<$B> \n\nApproach okay\n\n\nThen the third approach is to sit and to watch\n\n\nAnd I will not recommend that\n\n\nNow in addition to all of this with the point four C M basal line\nI 'd go for radiation therapy\n\n<$A> \n\nRadiation\n\n\nSo in addition to hormonal\n\n<$B> \n\nTo any of those three  ,  I will recommend\nradiation  ,  radiation therapy be given to you\n\n\n'Cause I 'm not very secure about that\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n Radiation   \n\n\n Ang liit ano  \n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's too close\n\n\nAll in all in all I think you know you you you 're healing very\nwell\n\n<$C> \n\nAll right\n\n<$A> \n\nSo it 's possible Doctor to just have hormonal and radiation\n\n<$B> \n\nYes that is an open option\n\n<$A> \n\nRadiation is fixed uh  buti hindi  chemo\n\n<$C> \n\nAlone alone  gusto mong sabihin  \n\n<$A> \n\nHormonal and radiation\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nIs that\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's acceptable\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's acceptable Doctor\n\n\nWhat do I buy with chemo I mean what do I get with chemo\n\n<$B> \n\nA slightly higher response rate\n\n\nYour your hormone therapy is only at best  mga  \nthirty-three thirty-six percent response rate\n\n\nYour chemotherapy is about sixty percent\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I 'll buy fifteen percent\n\n\nAnd the radiation will uh\n\n<$B> \n\nThe radiation is more for local control\n\n\nIt 's really just a for my I look at it as just a cleaning-up\nprocedure  ,  \n\n\nYou just tidy the place just to be sure   it 's really\nclean  na   \n\n<$A> \n\n Yes yes   \n\n\n Just to be sure   \n\n\nHow long  po yung  \n\n<$B> \n\nRadiation\n\n\nIf you go through chemo you 'll have the radiation after the chemo\n\n\nIf you 'll have hormonal therapy up front we can have the\nradiation therapy\n\n<$A> \n\nThe radiation, \n\n\nI have a cousin who 's an oncologist in the U S  Doktora\n\n \n\n<$B> \n\nYes  oo  \n\n<$A> \n\nSo maybe I can write him  ,  and mention all\nof these\n\n\nAlthough you know he said exactly  oo  exactly he\nmentioned\n\n\nBut he said it really depends on uh whether Dr Chan recommends\nchemo\n\n\nI mean it it 's an option he said\n\n\nBut definitely he mentioned uh Tamoxifen or Arimidex  , \n\n \n\n\nAnd he also mentioned radiation for local recurrence\n\n\n Parehong-pareho ho  so the the question now is\nwhether I want to undergo chemo\n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n Yes   \n\n\nI I think it 's not your wanting to it 's it 's how how aggressive\nyou are\n\n\nIf you 're a person who 'll do everything now how much fighting\nyou want to do\n\n\nIf if you 're not really all-out to fight  medyo-medyo lang\n\n fight a little then you know you will do hormonal therapy\n\n\nYou you 've gone far enough with surgery already so just that\nlittle more fighting and that 's it for you\n\n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nHow brutal is the chemo  ,  \n\n\nBecause you said that HER two shows it has to be\n\n<$B> \n\n Chemo   \n\n\nA stronger chemo\n\n<$A> \n\nA stronger chemo\n\n<$B> \n\nFour cycles of of A C doxorubicin containing <unclear> words\n\n</unclear> should be fine\n\n<$A> \n\nFour cycles\n\n<$B> \n\nOf A C\n\n<$A> \n\nOf A C\n\n\n Matapang ho yung  A C  ano  \n\n<$B> \n\n Hindi naman  \n\n\n K&aacute;ya naman  because you have all the\nsupport medicines for nausea vomiting\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor can I ask the cost\n\n<$B> \n\nThe cost less than ten thousand per   injection  \nyes the A C\n\n<$A> \n\n The chemo   \n\n\nSo injection  po yun  \n\n\nI don't have to stay overnight\n\n<$B> \n\nNo\n\n<$A> \n\nDoctor what stage is this\n\n<$B> \n\nTwo\n\n<$A> \n\nStage two stage two\n\n\nSo I have a good chance\n\n<$C> \n\nStage two\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\n Kasi iyak ako ng iyak  \n\n<$C> \n\n Sinasayang mo yung luha mo e  \n\n<$A> \n\nSo all my baseline data are okay are very good\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n\nYes just a few points are\n\n\nIf you had to sort them out to good not good  konti lang\nyung  not good  mas marami  yung good\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd how soon should the chemo start  Doktora  \n\n<$B> \n\nWe should start the chemo about a month after surgery\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd so two weeks\n\n<$B> \n\nSo we have two weeks to think about all of these\n\n<$A> \n\nIf I if I do the chemo I will not do the hormonal or  \nsabay ho yun  \n\n<$B> \n\nNo if you 'll have the chemo chemo  muna  \n\n\nAnd then we will use the hormonal as a maintenance\n\n<$C> \n\nAfter the cycle\n\n<$B> \n\nYes to sustain to sustain you in the next years after\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then the the radiation comes after the chemo\n\n<$B> \n\nYes uh you can have the radiation together with the hormonal\nagent\n\n<$C> \n\nAhhh okay\n\n<$A> \n\n Yun hong  radiation how much is that  \nDoktora  \n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's quite expensive\n\n\n  The average is  \n\n<$A> \n\n  Ilang  sessions  ho yung  \nradiation   \n\n<$B> \n\nFour to five weeks maybe\n\n<$A> \n\nFour to five days weeks\n\n<$B> \n\nFour to five four to five\n\n\nSometimes four weeks sometimes five weeks\n\n<$A> \n\nHow often  yung  \n\n\nEvery day\n\n<$B> \n\nEvery day\n\n<$A> \n\nWow\n\n\nHow much  ho yon Doktora  \n\n<$B> \n\nThe average patients spend about seventy thousand pesos\n\n<$A> \n\nPer\n\n<$C> \n\nOne seven  \n\n<$B> \n\nFor the whole treatment\n\n<$A> \n\nAhh seventy thousand\n\n\nSo the chemo is roughly ten thousand per cycle per per\n\n<$B> \n\nPer session\n\n<$A> \n\nI think my insurance can cover that, \n\n\nAnything else I need to know\n\n<$B> \n\nJust  ano  \n\n\nI think that that 's about all\n\n\nI don't think I need\n\n\nHow tall are you\n\n<$A> \n\nFive six five five and a half\n\n\nI have some questions  Doktora  \n\n\nAbout nutrition uh is it normal to feel weak or dizzy\n\n\nSometimes I don't know if it 's psychological I don't know if it 's\n\n<$B> \n\nOr menopausic symptoms\n\n<$A> \n\n Matagal na ho yung  menopause  ko e\n\n \n\n\n Pero  I still have  parang  hot\nflashes I don't know\n\n<$B> \n\nIt might be menopausic symptoms\n\n<$A> \n\nStill\n\n\nAnd then  ano ho yung  what can I eat and not eat\n\n<$B> \n\nYou can eat anything\n\n<$A> \n\nJust so that I eat okay\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd then can I continue taking vitamin supplements   \n,  and Lipitor\n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nYes okay\n\n<$A> \n\n Yun hong ano  my aunts in the States are\nsaying you buy immune enhancer  ano  M G N three and all that\n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know that  \n\n<$A> \n\n Hindi ho kayo  \n\n<$B> \n\nI don't know that\n\n\nIt 's not scientific  \n\n<$A> \n\n Hindi ho kayo  \n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's not scientific\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n\nI think those are my questions\n\n\nSo anything else so just continue the vitamin supplements\n\n<$B> \n\nHow much do you weigh now\n\n\nDid they weigh you\n\n<$A> \n\nA hundred I used to weigh one hundred thirty  parang\n\n one hundred twenty-five  ngayon  \n\n<$C> \n\n Naalis kasi yung  breast\n\n<$A> \n\n Yung maliit  \n\n<$B> \n\nI should weigh you maybe  \n\n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nSo the nausea can be controlled  Doktora  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah yeah it 's uh\n\n<$A> \n\nBecause I 'm so afraid of the nausea  Doktora  \n\n<$B> \n\nYes we have good drugs for for nausea and vomiting\n\n\nNot a very big problem\n\n<$C> \n\n Hindi na kamukha nung dati ano yung  side\neffects\n\n<$B> \n\nThe drugs the anti-vomiting drugs are so efficient\n\n<$A> \n\nSo I have to let you know in uh, soon\n\n<$B> \n\nYou have to pray for a decision  ,  \n\n\nIt 's not a simple decision\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes yes  Doktora    \n\n\nBut you 're I think you feel that maybe chemo should should be the\nbest\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear>

{"text": "<$A>\n\nFemale married from Bataan was admitted with the presenting symptom of\nsevere gastric pain\n\n\nThe accompanying signs and symptoms were fever nausea and vomiting\n\n\nPhysical examination revealed fever tachycardia hypotension\n\n\nThe lungs were positive for  basilar rals  \n\n\nAbdominal examination revealed tenderness diminished  \nbowel sounds and there is a positive  collin  sign\n\n\nPertinent past medical history revealed that the patient has mumps two\nweeks prior to admission\n\n\nUh we are entertaining a case of acute pancreatitis to rule out the\nfollowing conditions namely acute cholecystitis cholelithiasis pyclonephritis\nand hepatic abscess abscess\n\n\nWe are also ruling out peptic ulcer disease as well as acute\nappendicitis\n\n<$B> \n\nWith uh epigastric pain noted on this patient is there any\nassociation association to meals\n\n\nDoes it occur uh thirty or ninety minutes after meals or is there\nany radiation of the pain to the right scapular area or at the back\n\n<$A> \n\nAh this patient has a localized epigastric pain\n\n\nIt is not related to any food intake or  ano  any\nradiation at all\n\n\nThat 's why we ruled out cholelithiasis   disease  \n\n<$B> \n\n Since in   cholelithiasis the symptoms occurs only\nwhen the stone produces an inflammation or an obstruction of the cystic or\nthe common bile duct\n\n\nBut on physical examination the abdomen can be noted to be normal\nor there is only a  an uh a right upper quadrant pain\n\n<$A> \n\nUh huh\n\n<$B> \n\nIn your case the patient presented with an abdominal\ntenderness a diminished bowel sound and  collin 's  positive  \ncollin 's  signs which is uh likely not found in the case of\ncholelithiasis\n\n\nAnd one thing more on a simple ultrasonography of the abdomen in\nyou will right away note a stone formation in the gall bladder\n\n\nSo we can easily rule out the existence of cholelithiasis in this\ncase\n\n\nHow about considering uh a case of uh the existence of\npyelonephritis in this case\n\n<$A> \n\nUh,  the past medical  history of this patient was negative for any urinary tract infection\nwhich is usually true in  pyelonephritis,  \n\n\nAnd on physical examination the kidney <unclear> 1 word </unclear> \nwere also negative which is usually true in pyelonephritis\n\n\nThat 's why we tried to we ruled out pyelonephritis in this case\n\n \n\n<$B> \n\nBecause of the\n\n\nDid you note any   on\nyour physical examination did you note any uh  ichtricia  of the\nconjunctiva or any fever\n\n<$A> \n\nIt was negative the  ichtricia  is negative\n\n\nBut the patient was febrile on admission\n\n<$B> \n\nWas there any uh profuse sweating during the night any weight\nloss or any any loss of appetite or any changes in bowel movement\n\n<$A> \n\nUh it was negative all of these were negative according to the\npatient\n\n<$B> \n\nSo the the possibility of an existence of uh of a hepatic\nabscess is very nil since the history of this patient points uh rules out the\nexistence of uh hepatic abscess on the basis of the absence of the severe\nabdominal pain the palpable mass on the right upper quadrant which was not\nnoted in this case\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah that 's true  \n\n<$B> \n\nThe epigastric pain noted in this case is not associated with\nmeals\n\n\nSo peptic ulcer diseases is easily ruled out\n\n\nHow about uh the obstetrical clearance and the surgical clearance\nof this case\n\n\nWhen was the last menstrual period\n\n<$A> \n\nUh the last menstrual period was uh June, ten\n\n<$B> \n\nJune ten\n\n<$A> \n\nOf this   year  \n\n<$B> \n\n So   the existence of any ectopic pregnancies in\nthe uh intrauterine tumors or  whatsoever that causes that will\nmanifest as an acute abdomen in this case is also   ruled out  \n\n<$A> \n\n Is also ruled out   \n\n<$B> \n\nHow about the coexistence with uh an acute appendicitis\n\n<$A> \n\nAn acute  appendicitis as first at first was\nentertained\n\n\nHowever we immediately ruled it out uh after doing some physical\nexamination because uh in acute appendicitis the pain is uh located at the\n\n McBurnis  area as well as the rebound tenderness which is all\nnegative in this case\n\n<$B> \n\nAhhh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo we easily ruled it out\n\n<$B> \n\nWith all the differential diagnosis fully discussed in this\ncase the manifestations noted really points out to an acute pancreatitis\n\n\nWe are left with uh the laboratory diagnosis\n\n\nWe will be guided if we request a serum amylase and serum lipase\ndetermination and other auxiliary procedures like uh complete blood count\n\n\nAnd if the patient can afford it would be much appreciated if we\ncan do a C T scan which can confirm the diagnosis of pancreatitis and will be\nuseful for predicting in predicting the outcome and identification of late\ncomplications\n\n\nWe will manage the case as an acute pancreatitis\n\n\nWe will be compelled to give analgesia preferably Meperadin\n\n\nIf it warrants we will put on I V intravenous fluids\n\n\nWe will be placing the patient on a nasogastric intubation and N P\nO\n\n\nWe will treat the hypocalcemia if we note a presence of this case\n\n\nAntibiotics is also necessary when we if we will be able to\nestablish a concurrent infection and we 're obliged to give Cimetidine or any\nantacid to prevent a stress ulcer from developing\n\n\nSo this is a  frank  case of acute pancreatitis  \n\n<subtext.2> \n\n  \n\n<$A> \n\nSo May twenty-three today is June fifteen\n\n\nSeven plus fifteen twenty-two twenty-two days old\n\n\nHe or she, \n\n\nGirl good\n\n\nLucky you  ha  one boy and one girl\n\n\n Hoy  Albert is already three years old  'no\n\n three three and a half\n\n\nOh good, \n\n\nYou know how to space your children good family planning\n\n\nIs there any problem, \n\n\nOh I see\n\n\nSo this is your first well-baby check-up\n\n\nShe 's cute okay\n\n\nShe 's big and very active\n\n\nGood suck  ha  \n\n\nIt looks hungry\n\n\nAre you breastfeeding, \n\n\nWhy not, \n\n\nNo you just have to be patient\n\n\nJust let your baby suck so flow will improve\n\n\nYou know the stimulus to improve I mean increase your secretion is\nsucking\n\n\nNow every time your baby sucks she is sending a signal to your\nbrain to produce some more milk\n\n\nIt 's just like saying \" Mom I need some more milk\n\n\" so you produce some more milk\n\n\nWhereas if you bottle-feed your baby at the time when you 're\nsupposed to give her your breast there will be no more sucking and you will\nbe sending a negative feedback\n\n\nSo you stop producing milk because she doesn't need your milk\nanymore\n\n\nNow in order that your secretion will increase all you have to do\nis let your baby suck\n\n\nIt 's really sucking that improves the secretion, \n\n\nYes it may be painful but that is only temporary\n\n\nAfter some time you learn to adjust and there will be no more pain\n\n\nYou know it will be very unfortunate if you stop breastfeeding your\nbaby now because there 's just too much too many advantages\n\n\nNot only do you establish a good maternal bonding that is a close\nrelationship between you and your baby it is also very economical\n\n\nAlthough I know you can afford to buy these expensive formulas but\nthat is not enough\n\n\nYour baby is a human being and you are supposed to give her human\nmilk not cow 's milk\n\n\nThen not only that  'no  \n\n\nThe most important thing is your milk contains a lot of antibodies\nand these will help protect your baby from common infection\n\n\nWell you know even if you have cough or colds if it is contagious\nwhether or not you breastfeed your baby she will get it\n\n\nBut if you breastfeed her you 'll be giving her antibodies\n\n\nSo her resistance will improve and she will recover faster\n\n\nYou see I 'm speaking from experience  ha  \n\n\nMore than a doctor I am a mother breastfeeding mother\n\n\nI have five kids and I breastfeed all of them\n\n\nFunny  'no  \n\n\nYou know every time I get pregnant a lot of these uhm medical\nrepresentatives offer me their their formulas\n\n\nThey 're giving it for free\n\n\nAnd yet I still breastfeed my baby\n\n\nAnd you know the feeling is terrific\n\n\nThere is a feeling of contentment, \n\n\nYou know another thing\n\n\nIf you are breastfeeding you don't have to sterilize bottles\n\n\nYou don't have to worry about formulas getting out of stock or\nyour source of water\n\n\nYou know a lot of mothers now are already using this what do you\ncall this mineral water and it 's quite expensive you know\n\n\nAnd not only that\n\n\nYou don't even have to get up at night to to prepare formulas\n\n\nYour milk is there safe and ready available any time you need it\n\n\nBut of course you you also have to take care of yourself\n\n\nYou have to eat and drink a lot\n\n\nAnd take note  ha  it is not true that\nbreastfeeding while you 're you 're depressed or you 're tired is bad\n\n\nThere 's no such thing, \n\n\nWell have I convinced you\n\n\nSay \" yes \" because if not I will not stop unless\nyou do okay\n\n\nOh by the way do you have a baby book, \n\n\nNot yet okay I will give you one\n\n\nYou know you 're really lucky  ha  \n\n\nI just got it yesterday it 's been out of stock for several months\nalready\n\n\nHmm she 's alright\n\n\nYou can start with her vitamins now and be sure to burp your baby\nafter each feeding  ha  and give sterile water in between\nfeeding, \n\n\nGas pains\n\n\nHmm you know you will minimize gas pains if you let her burp every\nafter feeding\n\n\nAnd if she still does you may try turning her on her abdomen like\nthis okay like that and then gently pat or stroke her back like this okay and\nlater on she will pass out air\n\n\nGood, okay bring her back on July eight oh July five for her\nimmunization\n\n\nShe will start with B C G\n\n\nThen at two months O P V and D P T and so on okay", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWell first and foremost there are what we call signs and\nsymptoms of pregnancy\n\n\nSymptoms usually are the patient will usually complain of nausea or\nvomiting or dizziness usually in the early morning which is what we call\nmorning sickness or the medical term for that is hyper-   emesis\ngravidarium   \n\n<$B> \n\nNow is that always the case when there is a pregnant woman  \n\n <unclear> words </unclear>  \n\n<$A> \n\n Not really   not all not all pregnant women\ncomplain of this but mostly, uh uh about probably seventy percent\n\n<$B> \n\nWould complain about nausea   and vomiting  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   will have hyper-   emesis\ngravidarium   within the first, uh up to the twentieth\ntwentieth week\n\n<$B> \n\nUp to the twentieth week, now  ,  yes, \n\n doktora  now are there any other symptoms that I might uh\n\n<$A> \n\n At the latest the twentieth week   \n\n\nWell if there 's one more symptom which we call the  pica  \n,   which is  \n\n<$B> \n\n Now what 's a  pica    \n\n<$A> \n\nThe unusual craving for\n\n<$B> \n\nFood, \n\n<$A> \n\nUnusual food sometimes even some pregnant women will even\nresort to eating clay or soil 'cause of the  pica  \n\n\nThat is what we call in Tagalog  lihi  \n\n<$B> \n\n Pica  \n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\n Pica  \n\n\nOkay, so are those the only two symptoms   that I have to\nobserve  \n\n<$A> \n\n Most of the   those are the those are the most\ncommon symptoms\n\n\nOther  uh other signs will be amenorrhea or the\nabsence of menses and other another sign will be the, uh what do you call\nthis, enlargement of the abdomen\n\n\nSome of some women will also complain of engorgement of the breasts\nand hyper-pigmentation or the darkening of the nipples, the armpits and\naround the neck area\n\n<$B> \n\nUhm, now  doktora  about the darkening of\nthe nipples would that go back to normal\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah it will after pregnancy it will\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay so I 'm just curious  \n\n\nNow the second question is\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh but the diagnostic of course, the only\n\n the only time you can be sure that the patient is pregnant if, \nyou will get a positive   pregnancy test  or the you can see it in\nthe ultrasound that there is a baby in the womb\n\n<$B> \n\n Pregnancy test   \n\n\nUh is that possible even in two weeks or one week old,   \nthe ultrasound  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yes  , uh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nUh I see\n\n\nOkay, so my second question is uh how do I take care of my wife\n\n\nFor example if uh she 's pregnant what are the special precautions\nthat I have to watch out or I mean what is your suggestion about it\n\n<$A> \n\nWell pregnant women are usually most of the time they feel\nlazy they 're so sleepy\n\n\nYou just give them uh provide adequate rest and if they are\nsuffering from hyper-   emesis gravidarium   you\ncan give Vitamin B complex or some  anti-emetic like Bonamine\n\n<$B> \n\nJust Bonamine\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nWould that not affect  ano  have any effect on\nthe baby,   the Bonamine  \n\n<$A> \n\n No   that 's safe for pregnant women\n\n<$B> \n\nUh that 's safe\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd of course you give them pre-natal vitamins and iron\npreparations because when the patient is pregnant uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nShe would need all the supplies on her body to be   \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> for the baby  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah because uh yeah   the baby uses up the iron\nin her blood and calcium supplements also sometimes are needed\n\n<$B> \n\nSo now what foods do you suggest\n\n<$A> \n\nActually a pregnant woman can eat anything she wants  uh but   of course  \n\n<$B> \n\n Except me    \n\n<$A> \n\nNo but of course we would suggest nutritious food   for\nher  for her good and for the good of her baby\n\n\nUh we would shy away from junk food because that has no nutritional\nvalue\n\n<$B> \n\n Right   \n\n\nSoft drinks\n\n<$A> \n\nAll the more because it just contains sugar and the weight\nwill just go to the mother\n\n<$B> \n\nNot to the baby\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay, now what are the critical months that I have to watch\nout is it the first the second\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's usually the first three months or the first trimester\n\n  because  during this time the baby is just being formed\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n<$A> \n\nSo during this time it is uh, if the mother gets sick or\nshe takes medicines that are not allowed the baby can turn out to be deformed\nor with congenital abnormalities\n\n<$B> \n\nIn in the first   month  \n\n<$A> \n\n After the   third  after the first\ntrimester  ,  all the baby does is grow up so most of his parts\nare complete already\n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nHow about the last trimester, \n\n\nIs that also the critical  ay  a critical stage that\nit might be a premature birth if something   happens  \n\n<$A> \n\n It depends   it depends\n\n<$B> \n\nIt depends, case-to-case basis\n\n<$A> \n\nCase-to-case basis because like  placenta\n\n previa  or  abruptio  placenta they\nusually happen later on\n\n<$B> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you just have to be that 's why it   is  \nnecessary for the   pregnant  woman to go to  ,  \nto prenatal check-ups monthly\n\n<$B> \n\n Well   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Now I have a   cousin\n\n\nMonthly   prenatal check-ups  \n\n<$A> \n\n And then every   two weeks starting on the seventh\nmonth  ,  and then weekly on the on the, ninth month\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nNow, what if what would happen if uh during the first trimester\n, uh, my wife would contact what do you call this uh,  \nbulutong tubig ano 'yon  \n\n<$A> \n\nChicken pox\n\n<$B> \n\nChicken pox yes\n\n\nWhat would happen, I mean would that be a big effect on the baby\nor or what\n\n\nOr would that have no effect on the baby, at all\n\n\n  Or  nobody is sure\n\n<$A> \n\n Well   \n\n\nYou can never be sure if  uh sometimes we get pregnant\nwomen who get chicken pox early in their pregnancy but the babies turn out\nnormal\n\n\nWhat is the most feared sickness during pregnancy is German measles\n\n  or rubella , because chances are the baby will come out\ndeformed\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh   I see\n\n<$A> \n\nHe will have congenital cataract  microcephaly\n\n or small head congenital heart disease and all those other things\n, and  mental retardation also\n\n<$B> \n\nSo we really have to avoid German measles\n\n<$A> \n\nYes, now if you get rubella shots  \nif\n\n<$B> \n\nIs that advisable\n\n<$A> \n\nNo not to pregnant woman, to to single women or pregnant\n\n, single\n\n<$B> \n\nBefore getting pregnant\n\n<$A> \n\n 'Yon nga  if you have to get a rubella shot\nyou have to wait six months before you can get pregnant\n\n<$B> \n\nUh I see\n\n<$A> \n\nOr else\n\n<$B> \n\nOr else the vaccine\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nIt might affect the baby also within six months\n\n\nNow, now I 'm a dentist and I want to know do you suggest local\nanesthesia for extraction during pregnancy\n\n<$A> \n\nAs much as possible minor surgical procedures should be\ndeferred until after delivery unless it is absolutely necessary\n\n\nIf for example you have an impacted molar which is causing the pain\n, the patient so   much pain  \n\n<$B> \n\n Intense pain   yes\n\n<$A> \n\nWell you should have to weigh the the pros and the cons the\nbenefits for the patient and, possible adverse effects to the baby\n\n<$B> \n\nUh okay\n\n<$A> \n\nIf it 's absolutely necessary then\n\n<$B> \n\nNow\n\n<$A> \n\nIt is up to you\n\n<$B> \n\nNow for example it is just a filling, if it is just  \n\n a filling  \n\n<$A> \n\n Do you use   local anesthesia for filling\n\n<$B> \n\nYes we use local anesthesia\n\n\nNow, now what would happen if I use local anesthesia what, \nwhat are the effects\n\n\nWould it go to the placental barrier or or would just pass the\nbaby or what do you think would happen\n\n<$A> \n\nI 'm not so sure about local anesthesia but we usually advise\nthem\n\n<$B> \n\nTo avoid as   much as possible  \n\n<$A> \n\n To avoid   as much as possible\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay, so the interview is finished as of now and thank you\nvery much\n\n<$A> \n\nAny any further questions  \n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nThank you\n\n<$B> \n\n Tapos na   \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nDr  Del Fierro  judging from your uh\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm from my\n\n<$B> \n\nYour opening remarks   I  suspected that maybe you\nhad a change of heart   regarding  this\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n About   \n\n<$B> \n\nYour signature\n\n<$A> \n\nNo I don't have a change of heart\n\n\nI don't have a change of heart and I mentioned it again to uh Dr\n\n Mendoza , \n\n\nSo but that 's alright, I wish uh you could all sign it   \nand uh  I have nothing I have nothing against the  propositors  \nbut signing it uh I can't, \n\n<$B> \n\n We have   \n\n\nIt 's really up to you but I judging from what you said you made\nit appear that you would be in favor of such a proposal   this morning\n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n No I hope that   I did not, \n\n\nI hope I did not\n\n\nI said let me see what did I say\n\n\nI said that I know that there is a move for his uh extension and\nthat uh whatever might be the case uh\n\n<$B> \n\nYou are against his extension in other words\n\n<$A> \n\nI am, well I would say I am against the extension of uh it\ndoesn't have to be to be uh  Francisco Mendoza  you know\n\n\n  But uh  I I I I 'd like to stand by the uh present\npolicy of the uh of the uh Faculty Manual\n\n<$B> \n\n Okay but I think   \n\n\nBut it does say in the Manual that on a case to case basis   \n,  uh people can be extended\n\n\nSo if it were you I think we would do the same thing if it were Dr\nQuito we would also do the same thing\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nNo I if it were I don't want any exception\n\n<$B> \n\nBut there have been exceptions\n\n<$A> \n\nThere had been but that was in the past\n\n\nThat was during the uhm Andrew administration\n\n<$B> \n\nBut isn't this age discrimination\n\n<$A> \n\nUhm well then that 's a new philosophy\n\n<$B> \n\nNo it 's not\n\n\n  It 's not  a new philosophy\n\n<$A> \n\n It 's a   \n\n\nIt 's just that uh it 's just that I uh\n\n<$B> \n\nWell\n\n<$A> \n\nI feel that there must be some  ,  retirement\n\n<$B> \n\n Would would the   \n\n\nYeah well, it need not be sixty-five\n\n<$A> \n\nIn fact it can be earlier\n\n<$B> \n\nIn fact it could be later too\n\n<$A> \n\nIt could be later\n\n<$B> \n\nBut uh but in the case uh of some faculty members who retired\nthey 're hired on a part-time basis\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd they are still considered competent you know\n\n<$A> \n\nYes, no problem   with that  \n\n<$B> \n\n So then   what 's the point\n\n<$A> \n\nWell the point is that uh if there 's no movement up there\nthere would be no movement down here\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but there is a movement   there is a movement  \nthere is a movement down here, and we 're doing it\n\n<$A> \n\n And once   \n\n\nNo a movement in the sense that uh up here among among the seniors\nthere must be movement uh\n\n<$B> \n\nBut this is just cronyism isn't it\n\n\nWe are all intelligent people I think we have a right to say what\nwe think\n\n<$A> \n\nYes of course of course\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I think we we have arguments to support our case\n\n<$A> \n\nSo go ahead\n\n\nI mean uhm I I wish you the best and I have no I 've nothing\nagainst that  your view  prosper but uh\n\n<$B> \n\nI should hope not but anyway I think uh like I said before I\nthink it 's a gesture and uh  ,  the point is uh when somebody\nhas retired and then they turn back and re-hire him on a part- time basis to\nme it seems like exploitation\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nWell then if uh the person feels it is exploitation then I think\nuh the thing to do is not to uh not to teach\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah but that 's a very cruel argument  ,  \nbecause some people some people just don't have a choice\n\n\nWhen they turn sixty-five uh they don't have many other options\nand they 've been loyal to an institution and they 're still capable\nespecially in an institution of  academic learning, an\ninstitution of intellectuals\n\n\nThe mind is more fertile at that age\n\n<$A> \n\n No   \n\n\nYes even even even later\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh so I mean Kant uh wrote his work on religion when he\nwas uh way over sixty\n\n<$A> \n\nRight right\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd so you see for me it 's, sometimes uh I just

</unclear>  \n\n<$B> \n\n The way I see it   you know I just see it, I\nthink the way I see it very frankly is I think if there is some kind of\nsolidarity here then uh, I would expect your support\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nYou see\n\n\n'Cause otherwise uh uh the chairman just becomes uh you know he\nstands in opposition to the faculty\n\n\nBut if the faculty already has expressed its support I think uh a\nchairman should be should show his solidarity\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's not necessarily the case\n\n\nSo I mean I 'm giving you the uh this has always been this has\nalways been the\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay well, of course it 's your decision and this is not\nobligatory\n\n\nBut that 's just the way I see it, so I just want it, to be\nout in the open", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\n Trade and commerce industry communications banking education for the southern part of the Philippines and uh the need to establish Malaca&ntilde;ang here has been the dream of the Cebuanos for such a long time\n\n\nThat 's one of the reasons why the Cebuanos have been clamoring for a Cebuano President  'no  so that we can have a Malaca&ntilde;ang here in Cebu\n\n\nYou 'd be surprised how many people fly to Manila just to get some sort of government approval\n\n\nAnd uh many of these activities are really unnecessary except to help subsidize uh Philippine Airlines\n\n\nUhm the presence of a uh uhm Malaca&ntilde;ang uh in the Visayas uh would bring the President closer to the people and this is something that is truly meaningful to all of us\n\n\nWe 're very very appreciative for this event\n\n\nAt this point uh it 's hard to say how it will really benefit us but it has it 's never been tried before\n\n\nBut most definitely uh we are very elated with this development and uh this is a step in the right direction\n\n<$B> \n\nA step in the right direction indeed and uh that sense of optimism by Mayor Osme&ntilde;a is one vision being shared not only by the Cebuanos but by our people here in the Visayan region especially when we talk about areas like uh eastern Visayas and even parts of western Visayas\n\n\nThese areas in the past although the past administrations have tried their very best to ensure that uh development in these areas will come somehow the process has been very slow\n\n\nI think the momentum can be carried out toward the President ensuring that uh with the creation of the Cebu of the South will be an extension\n\n\nNow just looking at it here from Cebu uh what and uh maybe you 've heard about the problems in other areas of uh the Visayas what do you think should be one of the main agenda which uhm the people who are designated with the task should look at as uh priority areas\n\n<$C> \n\nUhm I think the the people now here in Cebu are quite having problems as regards energy and water and I think the people are complaining about the system the electricity and the water\n\n\nAnd I think it 's a good thing that there is uh an established uhm  extension Office of the President here in Cebu so that whatever problems the people might have they can easily go there to the office and not fly to Manila to give their complaints or whatever\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay very good points established by you uh William\n\n\nYou know one main element which the President mentioned last week when he went to Davao to induct into office Paul Enriquez who will be heading the Mindanao I mean the presidential office in Davao City is coming out with a master plan of development for the whole of Mindanao\n\n\nCebu over the past uh six years under the Aquino administration has experienced an economic boom\n\n\nThat 's why you talk about Ceboom and about only to be stopped uh I think by   typhoon Ping  when you had a lot of destruction\n\n<$C> \n\n Typhoon Ping   \n\n<$B> \n\nHow much Sir was that worth in terms of destruction\n\n<$C> \n\nI mean it uh tore the whole province down but then due to the the driving enthusiasm of the Cebuanos and their creativity their resourcefulness the province just rose from the ground and then as you can see there 's a lot of physical evidences uhm as regards the boom\n\n\nWe have uh construction boom uh tourism has quite expanded a lot\n\n\n  And  it 's very encouraging to know that President Ramos has set his sights on Cebu and the rest of the region also\n\n<$B> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nWell Cebu over the past uh uh six years under the Aquino uh administration has been experiencing very good growth rates\n\n\nG N P I think averaged between even higher than the national average of something like four percent\n\n\nAnd uh in terms of uh export earnings they have reached something like one or two hundred fifty million uh only last year\n\n\nUh tourism also a very good potential for development here in Cebu and the Visayas raked in about one hundred fifty-five million dollars in terms of the economy\n\n\nNow at this time uh we would like to play back for you uh a the visit of the President President Fidel Ramos at the semiconductor plant uh right after touching down here in Cebu\n\n\nThere you see the President\n\n\nOf course the semiconductor plant is just one of several companies that are located in the   Mactan Export Processing  Zone and this has provided so many jobs and one of the campaign promises of the President which he is now trying to attack is unemployment\n\n<$C> \n\n In Mactan yeah   \n\n\nUh uhm that 's one problem that we should address\n\n\nIt 's always possible\n\n<$B> \n\nBut uh if you try to look at the unemployment uh rate here in Cebu compared on a national level or even uh in other parts of the region the rate of unemployment is not as high\n\n\nSomething like uh uh eighteen well seventeen percent uh other areas especially  depressed areas they can go as high as twenty-five percent\n\n\nThere the President now\n\n<$C> \n\nWhat is he wearing\n\n<$B> \n\nWell in this area because semiconductor you talk about chips uh for computers which are essential in coming out with the manufacture of computers and high tech uh systems uh so the President is being  given a briefing now exactly how the entire operation of semiconductors goes on\n\n\nThe President uh uh has made this uh a part of his working visit to ensure that he goes to several areas uh where he considers the element of uh employment is very important\n\n\nUh I was talking to they say\n\n<$C> \n\nIs this  after they 've given him honors  ,  there in the Mactan Cebu International Airport\n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nI was talking earlier to the Trade Secretary uh Rizalino Navarro\n\n\nNow right now the present area of the Mactan Export Processing Zone is about one hundred twenty hectares talking about fifty-five companies\n\n\nBut the Trade Department is envisioning a total of uh more companies\n\n\nThey 're bringing in sixty so they need additional one hundred forty hectares\n\n\nHow would you talk about the space here in Cebu   for business  for investments\n\n<$C> \n\n I mean   \n\n\nWell there is uhm quite a lot I mean big a large amount of land which can be utilized as uhm business uhm to be used for business firms\n\n\nThey can also have uh construct their building complexes for the improvement of tourism in Cebu\n\n<$B> \n\nTourism in Cebu a major prospect for development\n\n\nAnd Cebu is can be a staging point to that \n\n of the the Visayas\n\n\nNow the benefits for the uh establishment of the Visayas uh here in Cebu of the Malaca&ntilde;ang here in the Visayas here specifically in Cebu is it becomes an extension arm for other regions in the country uh other provinces in the Visayas uh like Region six for western Visayas\n\n\nYou have the provinces of Aklan Antique Capiz Iloilo Negros Occidental\n\n\nIn uh Region eight this is one area that has been bothered so much by the insurgency but the peace and order situation has improved over the past five years\n\n\nAnd peace and order and political stability is one of the main agenda of the President during the first one hundred days\n\n\nAnd the province to be covered uh in terms of linking up with the Palace through the Cebu office uh Leyte Northern Samar Eastern Samar Western Samar and Biliran\n\n\nNow for central Visayas of course Cebu main focal point for you\n\n\nYou must be very happy Bohol Negros Occidental   and Siquijor  \n\n<$C> \n\n Yeah and Siquijor   \n\n<$B> \n\nYes these are around central Visayas\n\n\nWhich parts have you gone to which you think would be given uh top priority uh William\n\n<$C> \n\nWell I 've never been out of Cebu neither in Bohol Negros Occidental or Siquijor but I have lots of friends coming from Bohol and they have more or less the same complaint\n\n\nThey don't have potable water\n\n\nThey they have poor electrical system and also there in Negros I mean\n\n<$B> \n\nNegros well\n\n<$C> \n\nNegros business that is quite bad or\n\n<$B> \n\nWell\n\n<$C> \n\nCompared to Negros  Occidental <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nNegros Oriental is one of the provinces which is going to be given top priority\n\n\nIt 's just very close to Cebu\n\n\nOne of the major problems that has some uh that has always uh prevented the economic development in areas like Region eight like you talk about Leyte Samar has been the insurgency but this has been one problem that has been addressed very well\n\n\nAnd the uh reconciliation efforts of the President hopefully an amnesty program will be there for our rebel brothers from the communist rebels will be a very important element in ensuring that the peace and order situation in these areas will improve\n\n\nPower development is going to be one of the key factors which are considered necessary in the development of uh Leyte\n\n\nLeyte already host to a major geothermal plant\n\n\nNow at this time Eli if you 're ready with uh some reports let 's have you, \n\n<$D> \n\nAs we told you earlier the President took a helicopter from Mactan Airbase to the Visayas Command which is the headquarters of VisCom\n\n\nAnd then he was joined and welcomed by uh the veterans the uh Commander of the Visayas Command, and the uh P N P Chief uh Mr Roger Dumila, and a uh meeting with the veterans the council of elders\n\n\nThey were discussing a lot of things to the welfare of the uh veterans among which of course is or regards the pensions of the veterans and this the President promised to look into at the uh instance of meeting the leaders of the uh veterans council\n\n\nThere you have uh Joel Arnazo leading the President who used to be the uh commander here also at VisCom\n\n\nThis is a sentimental journey for the President because way back in nineteen seventy-one it was here when he was with the Philippine Army  twelfth  infantry brigade where the President earned his first star here at Camp Lapu-Lapu so that this place will always be a part of his memory\n\n\nThe President, had a briefing also on the peace and order situation from the P N P Chief\n\n\nAnd uh we 'll tell you more about the other activities this morning\n\n\nFor the moment we turn you over to Freddie and William\n\n<$B> \n\nThank you very much Eli for that report uh with the uh meeting with the top military commanders in the area led by General Zulueta who was only promoted last uh Friday at the Palace\n\n\nI had an opportunity to talk with him\n\n\nCountryside development one area in the past administrations which was well not with the Aquino administration I guess this has been given top priority is the area in Samar and we 're very happy to have with us one of the governors Governor Bravo who was has been doing a very great job to ensure that development in that area will come with insurgency hopefully not a problem\n\n\nGovernor it 's a pleasure to have you again\n\n\nYou must have a vision of uh I mean you must be very happy that the President uh is showing more concern now for the south and you are you have the Malaca&ntilde;ang of the south here in the Visayas in Cebu\n\n\nHow do you expect this to work in terms of forging a better and working relationship with uh the President\n\n<$E> \n\nYes first uh Fred uh we 're very much uh gratified that uh there 's going to be a Malaca&ntilde;ang in the south uh particularly in Cebu\n\n\nI think this is the first right step uh because uh here you 're getting to know one another and you are reaching out okay\n\n\nThat 's the first stage of development\n\n\nYou cannot develop uh people uh unless and until uh you know their leaders\n\n\nIn uh Region eight where I come which uh comprises uh these the provinces of Samar and Leyte we are still in that uh stage where we want the basic uh needs for our people\n\n\nBasic in the sense that uh while uh other countries would have reached that uh so-called <unclear> word </unclear> uh newly-industrialized countries here in the Philippines and particularly Region eight uh we still want uh power uh infrastructure countryside development uh and uh we would like to stamp out the problem of insurgency via these uh livelihood projects uh\n\n<$C> \n\nOn the line let me ask the Governor,  how can this uh extension Office of  President be of help to your province as a Governor\n\n<$E> \n\nNumber one uh Cebu is a little bit uh nearer to Samar and Leyte and which means that uh it is uh less expensive uh in going to Manila\n\n\nAnd uh besides uh we 're talking uh of decentralization and local autonomy and that is now uh the idea which uh whose time has come \n\n Uh with Eric Pelaez we do not have to be going to the bureaucratic uh debilitating system of governance in what you call the imperial uh city of Manila which is after all has many problems of brown-outs of garbage of traffic and pollution\n\n\nUh anyway we are helping the nation by having Malaca&ntilde;ang in the south so that we can decongest uh certain areas in Manila\n\n\nDid you know that for example uh the uh Smokey Mountain in Tondo would uh really uh uh be solved uh if we really decentralized because most of the population in the Smokey Mountain uh comes from Samar Leyte\n\n\nSo instead of uh you know uh going to Manila every now and then in the process uh sustaining that policy of mendicancy and dependency where we have to beg for financial aid for approval of feasibility study for giving the go ahead signal towards uh uh programs of worth all we have to do is refer it to Pelaez uh come now to uh the very nice pleasant pleasing uh hospitable city of Cebu where uh we can get things done and get results uh\n\n<$B> \n\nThank you Governor for joining us and good luck and hopefully all the support that you wanted will be coming from the Palace\n\n<$E> \n\nThank you very much uh Fred and thank you   for having me  \n\n<$C> \n\n Will   when you come back to Eastern Samar you can spread the good news to those people\n\n<$E> \n\nI hope uh we have uh one like this in uh Eastern Samar\n\n\nI hope uh if this is via satellite we can be reached in Borongan\n\n\nThank you very much\n\n<$B> \n\nThank you Governor\n\n\nGovernor uh Bravo of uh the Province of Eastern Samar one area which is has been bothered by the insurgency problem but the peace and order situation has gradually improved over the years\n\n\nAnd hopefully with a very sincere effort with the President and with the support of both houses of Congress to come up with an amnesty program for the rebels\n\n\nAnd hopefully there will be a very good chance that this twenty-year insurgency will be finally resolved\n\n\nAnd this time Eli how are you, \n\n<$D> \n\nThe sentimental journey of President Ramos to Camp Lapu-Lapu where he earned his first star was highlighted by two events\n\n\nThis was the dialogue with the uh veterans but before that there was a closed door conference for the military officers with General Romeo Zulueta of the Visayas Command and the Chief of the uh P N P General Roger Dumila\n\n\nThese two officers namely General Zulueta and General Dumila are no strangers to the area\n\n\nAs we know General Dumila has just presently returned to Cebu\n\n\nThis was also joined by some of the members of the First Family\n\n\nWe uh have here the Secretary the Executive Secretary Peter Garrucho we have the uh D I L G Secretary Raffy Alunan and the other dignitaries who joined the President in this meeting with the officers of the VisCom\n\n\nThe President was given a uh comprehensive picture as to the peace and order situation obtaining in the area\n\n\nAnd uh there you have General Dumila who gave the briefing to the President on the peace and order situation in the Visayas\n\n\nWe also have here the uh the Chief of the of the uh Secretary of the Department of National Defense Secretary Renato de Villa\n\n\nAnd we will have more of the activities that are taking place here in Cebu with the visit of the President\n\n\nFor the moment we turn you over to Freddie and William\n\n<$B> \n\nThank you very much uh Eli for that report at Camp Lapu-Lapu\n\n Rod Reyes\n\n\nOf course when you talk about seeing Secretary Alunan one of the the things that comes into your mind is uh the Local Government Code but at the same time the war against crime \n\n Commission on Anti-Crime and the perhaps one of the major action programs which the President wants addressed during his first one hundred days is the war against crime and this has been very successful during the past two weeks since its launching with Erap Estrada right there\n\n\nAnd hopefully the momentum being carried out in uh in the Luzon area will be carried out here in the Visayas and even Mindanao\n\n\nNow William\n\n<$C> \n\nAs usual uh the First Lady will have the <unclear> 1 word </unclear> activities this afternoon\n\n\nUh she will visit Maytabal Rattan Exporting Company and right after that she will visit the Street Children Center at Parian for a short program\n\n\nAnd I think uh the First Lady herself has a lot of things in her itinerary\n\n<$B> \n\nWell the First Lady also a very active uh person and uh one of her top priority\n\n\nWell she has been designated as somebody who should be in charge of beautification but prior to the President 's oath-taking  I was talking to the First Lady and one of her top priorities is to plant more trees and reforestation\n\n\nAnd one of the main agenda of the Ramos government is sustainable development but at the same time ensuring environmental protection\n\n\nTo ensure that the environment we have will not dissipate even if development will come\n\n\nJoining us at the stage is the Governor of a very small island but I  I guess very beautiful twice Governor Ben Aquino of Siquijor\n\n\nGovernor uh welcome to our coverage\n\n\nYou must be very happy that you have  itong tinatawag nating  Malaca&ntilde;ang of the South  dito sa  Cebu\n\n\nHow does this help you in a way considering that in the past uh some of the attention is not coming out\n\n<$F> \n\nUhm not exactly \n\n If uh government in this project of uh Malaca&ntilde;ang in the South if government has to to appropriate uh funds for the purpose I feel that it is not necessary\n\n\nWe have the different regional offices of the different agencies\n\n\nWe have the governors who could uh directly go to Malaca&ntilde;ang uh for anything that uh would need uh the attention from the President probably\n\n\nI guess we will have uh a monthly conference with the President\n\n\nSo as I said if uh government has to to appropriate additional funds for this purpose I think it 's not necessary\n\n<$B> \n\nWell anyway just looking at uh discussing regional concerns that can be worked out together among the provinces to ensure that development can be very balanced",

the Cojuangco building\n\n\nYou know as of now uh former President Cory Aquino is coming in  ano  \n\n The three different marches are already converging\n\n\nWe can actually estimate the crowd that 's between  siguro  twenty and twenty-five thousand  napakaraming tao  and confetti is being thrown from all the buildings around us\n\n\nYou know the uh program after the national anthem was sung uhm various members of cause-oriented groups  ano  took to the stage and voiced out their concerns\n\n\nThey talked about fears something like about the Supreme Court power\n\n\nThey talked about opening up their fears about opening up businesses to foreign investors\n\n\nThey talked about cronyism and  hindi  constitutional change  ang tawag  nila dito ang tawag nila dito  constipational change\n\n\nAlright uhm at this point  ayan na nga dumarating na lahat ng tao  from the various uh rally sites\n\n\nThis is  siguro  uhm <unclear> 1 word </unclear> of what 's to come  kasi  the

uh there are formal groups uh Gabriela uhm student bodies that\nhave that have been trying to get into Ayala Avenue since an hour ago but who\nhave been stopped because of the number of people along Ayala Avenue\n\n\nIf we can pan this way uh I 'll I 'll take you through the street\n\n\nOkay we 're panning towards the Philippine Stock Exchange and this\nis Paseo de Roxas\n\n\nUh we 're coming up to Ninoy 's statue\n\n\nRight behind me are the  stage system tents that\nis the main stage right there\n\n\nRaul Roco Senator Raul Roco and Senator Teofisto Guingona are being\nintroduced uh Senator Sergio Osme&ntilde;a\n\n\nUh former President Corazon Aquino is on stage right now you can\nsee them, \n\n\nOkay towards Insular Life Building you can see I 'd just like to\nshow you the number of people here\n\n\nWe are estimating uh around fifteen to twenty thousand people here\nbut uh we expect more as the people from Cory Aquino 's office has said that\naround ten thousand more people are on their way here\n\n\nThey call them the Yellow Army\n\n\nUh President Aquino came from the Cojuangco building along Buendia\nAvenue around uh two kilometers from where I am and she marched all the way\nfrom  the Cojuangco Building down Buendia down Ayala Avenue met\nwith the  the various marchers coming from the Buendia Fire\nStation down Ayala Avenue and they were met by their group that are here\nright now\n\n\nThis program like I said is going to go on until three thirty or\nfour this afternoon\n\n\nThere is going to be a liturgy and a homily uh later this afternoon\n\n\nThere will be no Mass but there will be a liturgy and a homily by\nuh Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin and a and a speech by former President\nCorazon Aquino\n\n\nWe will be here S N N will be bringing you the events live from\nAyala Avenue and also our reporters in Luneta Miranda de Quiros and uh\nKarmina Constantino are stationed at the Luneta Grandstand and at the Manila\nHotel\n\n\nIn the meantime I 'm Jing Magsaysay\n\n\nWe will be back a little later\n\n\nRon back to you\n\n<$B> \n\nThank you Jing Magsaysay and Pinky Webb reporting live from\nAyala Makati\n\n\nMeanwhile from Makati we move on to the Luneta area\n\n\nI believe the mood remains festive there as more and more  \nEl Shaddai  members flock for tonight 's celebration\n\n\nKarmina Constantino is there and she gives us this update\n\n\nKarmina\n\n<$C> \n\nThanks Ron\n\n\nRoasted cows and pigs are not the only one from the menu today it\nseems like members of the  El Shaddai  Charismatic\nMovement have also developed an appetite for roads and any available space\n\n\nThere is no stopping them from flocking to the Quirino Grandstand\ntoday to celebrate their founder 's birthday and the group 's fifteenth\nanniversary\n\n\nWe 're here at the tenth floor of the Manila Hotel where we 've\nbeen closely monitoring the influx of followers of  El Shaddai\n\n and let me tell you Ron they 've been pretty consistent in\nfurthering their number\n\n\nThey 've already taken over a great portion of Roxas Boulevard\n\n\nLet 's talk some figures here\n\n\nThe Western Police District estimates the Grandstand to accommodate\nabout four hundry or four hundred and eighty thousand people and that 's only\ntalking about the immediate environs of the Grandstand alone that 's about\nfour people per square meter\n\n\nAnd if the crowd spills over to Roxas Boulevard which it has\nalready the figure according to the W P D estimates will only amount to half\na million that 's five hundred thousand and judging from what we 're looking\nat over here that 's I think uh a rough estimate is about five hundred\nthousand people we 're looking at right now\n\n\nAnd that 's a far cry from the three to five million mark estimated\nby the  El Shaddai  group\n\n\nBut see it 's still quite early in the day also sporadic rains may\nhave delayed the arrival of some groups\n\n\nBut Ron whether it 's a crowd of five hundred thousand or five\nmillion W P D Director Chief Superintendent Efren Fernandez assures there are\nmore than enough policemen securing the area\n\n\nAside from the one thousand four hundred policemen from the Special\nAction Force the Western Police District and the Regional Mobile Group have\nalso deployed an additional uh two thousand policemen to strategic points in\nthe area to make sure any untoward incidents will not disrupt today 's event\n\n\nRon we 're about an hour and a half into today 's celebration and\nso far no arrests have been made\n\n\nHowever our roving reporter Macel Ingles uhm have has told us\nrather policemen downstairs are already having a hard time patrolling the\n\n lechon  lines as some members of the  El Shaddai\n\n Charismatic Movement are trying to get into to get in front of the\nline to take part of today 's feast\n\n\nNow in spite of that Chief Superintendent Efren Fernandez is\noptimistic it 's gonna turn out to be a peaceful day\n\n\nTheir main concern right now is traffic and crowd control  \n\n\nAlright\n\n\nTraffic enforcers from the Traffic Management Bureau have already\nbegun re-routing traffic\n\n\nThe portion of Roxas Boulevard going to Pasay has already been\ntaken over by members of the  El Shaddai  Charismatic\nMovement and north bound vehicles are also having a hard time going through\nthe crowd\n\n\nAnd judging from the way it looks up here I think Ron we 're only\ncounting minutes before the whole of Roxas Boulevard is gonna be taken over\nby members of the  El Shaddai  Charismatic Movement\n\n\nReporting live from the Manila Hotel I 'm Karmina Constantino\n\n\nBack to you Ron\n\n<$B> \n\nKarmina Constantino from the Manila Hotel\n\n\nNow we move closer to the festivities\n\n\nWe have Miranda de Quiros reporting from the Quirino Grandstand\n\n\nMiranda  \n\n<$D> \n\nThank you Ron\n\n\nThe rains will not dampen the spirit of the members of the\n\n El Shaddai  \n\n\nThey are on their feet now singing and dancing to their favorite\ngospel songs\n\n\nThey call this part of the celebrations \" the joyful\nworship \" and they are literally expressing their happiness as they\npraise their  Yahweh El Shaddai  \n\n\nEarlier we also heard some members deliver their testimonies on how\ntheir lives were touched by the Lord\n\n\nWhile the program is going on other members are still lining up to\nget their share of the roasted calves and pigs Brother Mike Velarde had in\nstore for the  El Shaddai  members in his sixteenth in his\nsixtieth birthday thanksgiving  salu-salo  \n\n\nThe  El Shaddai  members have been lining up by\nthe food stalls as early as ten o'clock this morning\n\n\nAt three o'clock this afternoon a helicopter would be going around\nthe Quirino Grandstand to drop Miracle Christian Souvenirs\n\n\nAfter that the birthday celebrant Brother Mike will be leading the\nmembers through an offering prayer and then they will be releasing the\nballoons they brought with their wishes and prayers written on it\n\n\nPresident Joseph Estrada is also expected to grace the event and\ndeliver an inspirational message at around five o'clock this afternoon  \n\n\nThat 's it for now\n\n\nBack to you Ron\n\n<$B> \n\nWelcome back to this special edition of the S N N Mid-day\nReport\n\n\nWe now bring you back Jing Magsaysay who is at

Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin\n\n\nThere are around fifteen to twenty thousand people here right now\n\n\nI am on top of a platform uh and uh in the background you can see\njust part of the huge crowd that have gathered here\n\n\nUh this crowd stretches up to the end of Ayala Avenue towards\nBuendia and Paseo de Roxas is filled from end up to the other end and this\ngoes all the way down the road\n\n\nThere are around a little while ago there were around fifteen to\ntwenty thousand people now they they are there are about some twenty-five\nupwards to thirty thousand people gathered here right now\n\n\nIt is uh quite impossible to move around the central area\n\n\nAs you can see the people who have been here since this morning are\nsort of stuck here\n\n\nUhm it 's been raining on and off people  can't move uh\npeople are drenched already\n\n\nUmbrellas spring up whenever the rain falls and they come down like\nthey 're down now when it 's just drizzling\n\n\nConfetti has been showering since this morning\n\n\nWe came here at around four this morning to set up the  \nSarimanok  News Network live coverage\n\n\nThere was no one here early this morning except the media\n\n\nBut people started trickling in at around six o'clock this morning\nfrom various parts of the Philippines even even people from Saudi Arabia as\nuh Pinky earlier reported have come home to attend this rally\n\n\nThe rally according to organizer Noel Tolentino he is just one of\nthe organizers was was uh was organized to bring to the attention of\nPresident Estrada certain issues because allegedly according to them they\ncould not get these issues straight to the President\n\n\nI guess an audience would be in order\n\n\nUhm some of these issues are of course uh charter change uhm uh the\neconomic provisions of the charter change and uh there are provisions\nspecific to certain sectors of society\n\n\nThere are provisions from the farmers provisions from uh proposals\nfrom fishermen proposals from businessmen\n\n\nA little while ago we interviewed uh Pastor Saycon who was a\nvice-president of the Management Association of the Philippines and who just\nresigned from that Association due to circumstances that have been uh that\nhave been uh uncontrolled circumstances that have been coming his way the\npast days\n\n\nBut he resigned and we had that interview this morning\n\n\nThis program is scheduled to go on until four o'clock this\nafternoon\n\n\nWe will stay with the program until four o'clock this afternoon\n\n\nWe 'd like now to turn you over to the stage where the program is\nin progress  \n\n<$A> \n\n venues at the same time so you can see\nfor yourself what 's going on here in Makati and what 's going on at the\nLuneta uh\n\n<$E> \n\nTo give them an ultimate  ano  \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$E> \n\nUhm Karmina Constantino had earlier told us that the crowd\n\n daw  in uh Luneta is reaching about five hundred thousand\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's a big crowd\n\n<$E> \n\nYeah\n\n\nBut a far cry  pa rin daw  from the three million\nexpected  doon sa  Luneta\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay okay\n\n<$E> \n\nOn the other hand  naman  here in Ayala Avenue\n\n padami ng padami ang tao  \n\n<$A> \n\n Oo  a little while ago I said there were\nthirty thousand but I took a short walk because a short walk is all I can\ntake because you can't get too far\n\n<$E> \n\nThat 's right\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd uh there are there must be around fifty to sixty thousand\npeople here already\n\n\nThey were expecting something like fifteen to twenty thousand to\ncome here today\n\n<$E> \n\nThat 's right  oo ang sabi pa  maximum thirty\nthousand but as it is now it 's doubled\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah uhm there are so many people they have overflowed into\nthe cordoned-off area that we have right here\n\n\nPinky and I are on top of a platform that is around six feet high\nuh that 's the only reason we 're not crowded in but a lot of our countrymen\nare shoulder-to-shoulder literally uhm\n\n\nAnd at this height from the platform we could feel the body heat\ncoming off the crowd and coming through the air\n\n\nUh yellow confetti has been permeating the air since this morning\n\n\nWhat is going on right now at the stage is that they have been\nsaying prayers\n\n\nPinky has been following the prayers\n\n\nUhm they we they are at the prayers\n\n\nYou see what they 're doing is they 're delivering the issues to\nPresident Estrada in the form of prayers\n\n\nSo ever since we started we started with the national anthem and\nthen ecumenical opening prayer from a Catholic representative a Protestant\nrepresentative a Muslim representative and then uh we had opening songs and\nthen the prayer petitions from sectors and groups\n\n<$E> \n\n Yan mga  various sectors  yun mga  \n\n,  mga mambubukid uh mananalakal  all all all the sectors\nwhat they uh Noel Tolentino is actually briefing us in all these is uh\nbriefing us on the media what actually is going to happen today uh\n\n\nAnd  sabi nga niya  is that they decided  \ndaw kasi Jing uhm medyo nahihirapan silang i-  penetrate  si\nPresidente Erap  so  ang ginawa nila   , \n\n instead of tongue lashing  ,  \n\n\nThey wanted to do it through a prayer kind of like a prayer\n\n sa  various sectors  may  representative\n\n kunwari ang mambubukid meron silang  prayer  na\nsariling kanila yung mga  mangangalakal meron silang sariling\n\n prayers  para sa kanila  \n\n<$A> \n\n  Oo    \n\n\n  Oo nga raw    \n\n\n Yeah   \n\n\n Oo oo si  Joey Cuisia  yung nag-  \ndeliver  ng  prayer  para sa mga negosyante\nmangangalakal at propesyunal  \n\n\nI 'd like to stress a point here which was conveyed to us by the\norganizers earlier today\n\n\nIt 's noisy here so we we can't hear  nahihirapan din kami\n\n we can't hear the the commands from the control van\n\n\nUh anyway like I said various prayers are are now being delivered\nright here in Makati\n\n\nUh what we 're looking forward to is the singing of \" \n\n Ama Namin  \" the reading of the sacred scripture uhm\nthe homily the reading of a joint statement uh \"  Manindigan\nTayo sa Demokrasya  \" a presentation of a signed statement\n\n\" A Covenant for Democracy \" to Cardinal Sin and former\nPresident Cory Aquino the signing of the Covenant by Cardinal Sin and former\nPresident Cory Aquino and of course uh the final

of a new ceiling walls and a new carpet\n\n\nThe old royal blue carpet was uh torn out to make way   for a\nnew wool carpet  although still royal blue but with borders in\ncontrasting hues\n\n<$C> \n\n Eight million pesos  daw yan  Pia   \n\n<$A> \n\nJing you 're asking about costs\n\n\nUh this was uh this cost the House of Representatives about seven\npoint five million four million for the

alone\n\n\nAnd on the other groups they are converging probably over two\nthousand more at the uh near the uh front of the Saint Peter 's Church and\nthat one near the Don Antonio intersection of Commonwealth Avenue\n\n\nOn the other side of the uh Commonwealth Avenue you could see Jing\nthat there are the contingents of the Philippine National Police lined up\nalong the island with their respective shields and barriers to avoid the uh\nthe uh oncoming rallyists to be able to cross towards the area of the  \nBatasan  complex\n\n\nAnd as you could see Jing uh there is uh some uh uh

{"text": "<$A> \n\n\nThe President has just arrived at the  Batasang Pambansa\n\n complex\n\n\nShe 's expected to deliver her speech at around four uh this\nafternoon\n\n\nTraditionally, the President as she walks in will take a little time\nto speak with members of the House of Representatives the Speaker of the\nHouse uh in the lounge\n\n\nUsually she goes into the south lounge uh the executive lounge which\nis located adjacent to the front area of the Session Hall of the House of\nRepresentatives\n\n\nThere is a doorway leading from  this lounge going into\nthe Session Hall\n\n\nYou see the President has just has just entered that lounge and the\ndoors are going to be closed behind her and her staff\n\n\nUh in that in that lounge are members of the House of\nRepresentatives as well as the Senate\n\n\nThe Senate President and the Speaker of the House are expected to\nreceive the President in that lounge\n\n\nAnd uh in a few minutes we could expect the President come out of\nthe left side of the Senate Session Hall if I I remember my House of\nRepresentatives geography right  \n\n\nShe 's expected to exit from the left side the side on our left if\nyou 're watching with me\n\n\nUh and she 's expected to make her way to the podium\n\n\nUh behind her are going to be seated the Senate Vice President the\nSpeaker of the House and the Vice-President I expect and uh she 's going to\ndeliver her State of the Nation Address\n\n\nA very short ceremony before that\n\n\nUh Malaca&ntilde;ang has been saying that her speech today is going\nto be short and simple\n\n\nHer speech last year was around forty-five or fifty minutes long\n\n\nUh in that speech she outlined her thirty-five promises and uh out\nof the thirty-five there are some groups that say twenty-two promises were uh\ndelivered by the President and her administration her cabinet\n\n\nUh word the the word is is that the President is going to make new\npromises in this new speech uh but focus on very few things uh peace and\norder uh being one of them uh power rates is another thing that the President\nis going to focus on that probably being the closest to issue to the hearts\nof the people at this time\n\n\nWe we 're going to await the entrance of the President into the\nHall\n\n\nIn the meantime we still have Dr Abueva and Prof Romero with us in\nthe studio  \n\n<$B> \n\n\n\nJing at this moment uh President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is\nstill closeted in one of the offices here at the  Batasang Pambansa\n\n building with Senate President Franklin Drilon Speaker of the House\nJose Joe de Venecia the Secretary-General of the House\n\n\n\nUh these personalities had met her earlier when she arrived here at\nthe  Batasan  \n\n\n\nIt is exactly sixteen minutes before the President is uh set to\naddress the a joint session of Congress\n\n\n\nUh great expectations once again of the President 's SONA and of\nthe President herself on this her second State of the Nation Address\n\n\n\nUh she will of course by this State of the Nation Address open the\nsecond regular session of the twelfth Congress\n\n\n\nThe President is now on her way to the uh Session Hall where\nSpeaker de Venecia and Senate President Drilon are waiting for her waiting to\nhear what she has to say\n\n\n\nAs I said great expectations because as we all know she will be\nfocusing very strongly and emphasizing very strongly on the need to\nstrengthen the Republic\n\n\n\nShe will be talking about a strong Republic that will be the theme\nof her SONA this year\n\n\n\nThis historic  Batasang Pambansa  building has been\nwitness to a very colorful political history of this country\n\n\n\nWe all know that uh this was inaugurated in nineteen seventy-eight\nuh with the interim  Batasang Pambansa  calling it home\n\n\n\nUh many have said that it was actually a rubber-stamp Parliament uh\nby uh of Ferdinand Marcos former President\n\n\n\nThat Parliament was elected in nineteen seventy-eight\n\n\n\n ,  The interim\n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n Pia   \n\n<$B> \n\n\n\nYes Jing\n\n<$A> \n\n\nPia I 'm going to ask you to take off your hat as an as an\nanchor and our co-host this afternoon and put on your hat as a subject matter\nexpert\n\n\nUh politically while everyone is excited about what the President\nis going to say today and we all know what the reactions are going to be in\nthe days to come uh but the focus will be on politically what 's happening at\nthe Senate\n\n\nBecause a lot of things are hinged on that critical numbers game in\nthe Senate\n\n\nNow that the majority uh has the numbers what do you expect to\nhappen uh down the line\n\n<$B> \n\n\n\nWell Jing uh we can always say  na  the Senate\nuh the administration has the majority now in the Senate\n\n\n\nBut let 's not forget it 's a very slim majority\n\n\n\nUh it 's thirteen eleven  ,  \n\n\n\nSo  ang lamang lang ng  administration  sa\n\n opposition  ay isa lang   ,  so\n\n napakaliit na na na linya yan ano  Jing\n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n Yeah   \n\n\n\n Uh huh   \n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n The President now in the\nlobby of the  Batasang Pambansa  building\n\n\n\nShe 's in a mustard orange uh suit\n\n\n\nBeside her is Senator Loren Legarda in a Muslim-inspired attire\n\n\n\nA while ago uh the First Gentleman Mike Arroyo was being escorted\ninto the  Batasang Pambansa  Session Hall by uh Mrs Gina de\nVenecia the wife of the Speaker\n\n\n\nAnd with the First Gentleman were the children of the President\nLuli Mikey and Dato\n\n\n\nJing as you were saying yes a very slim majority in the Senate\n\n\n\nIt 's not something exactly to be comfortable about\n\n\n\nI suppose that the administration will have to get more Senators on\ntheir side from the opposition\n\n\n\nThe President uh going down the newly the the Session Hall\n\n\n\nAs we can see it 's a brand new carpet brand new ceiling brand new\nwalls and uh the refurbishment has cost the House of Representatives seven\npoint five million pesos\n\n\n\nThe President there being greeted by members of the House of\nRepresentatives and of the Senate\n\n\n\nThey 're going to be sitting in joint session this afternoon as\nthey listen to her second State of the Nation Address\n\n<$A> \n\n\nPia yeah uh let 's not let 's not take the video away from the\nscreen uh\n\n\nThe President is expected to deliver her Address soon\n\n\nLet 's just be in the background and provide and provide color\n\n\nA lot of people have a lot of expectations but a lot of people also\nhave been saying the same thing about what they expect about the President\npeace and order power rates uh jobs uh on top of a whole list of things that\nthey expect the President to talk about\n\n\nHave you had more information\n\n\nYou gave us an idea an outline a sense of what the President is\ngoing to talk about\n\n\nIs there anything any new information about anything that she 's\ngoing to say today\n\n\nPia\n\n<$B> \n\n\n\nWell Jing uhm you know the problem  kasi  with\nuh early releases of the President 's State of the Nation Address is that it\ncan change at any time\n\n\n\nSometimes  may magbibigay sa inyo ng isang kopya ng isang\n\n State of the Nation Address  at sasabihin  as of two\nA M as of three A M   four A M  \n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n That happens every year   \n\n<$B> \n\n\n\nSorry  \n\n<$A> \n\n\nThat happens every year\n\n<$B> \n\n\n\nYes yes that 's right\n\n\n\nSo you know  kahit na maging  specific  tayo\nminsan nagkakaproblema dahil mayroong hindi na babanggitin si GMA na uh una\nna nating nabanggit  so we try to as much as possible not to be too\nspecific\n\n\n\nThe session is about to be called to order Jing\n\n<$A> \n\n\nOkay Pia  \n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n Fifty-four minutes  \n\n<$B> \n\n\n\nThe President 's State of the Nation Address\n\n\n\nThe President 's second State of the Nation Address forty  forty-eight minute speech applauded seventy-four times interrupted by\napplause seventy-four times\n\n\n\nThe President there declaring war on crime terrorism and poverty a\nwar she says that must be won decisively if a strong Republic is to emerge at\nall unsullied by dominant classes and sectors\n\n\n\nThe President there saying that the economy is strong now that the\nPhilippines is the third best-performing economy in Asia and the\nbest-performing in Southeast Asia\n\n\n\n  The President also saying  \n\n<$C> \n\n\n\n On behalf of the Senate   \n\n<$D> \n\n\n\n<unclear> words </unclear> The House of Representatives the\njoint session is adjourned  \n\n<$B> \n\n\n\nSpeaker Jose de Venecia adjourning the joint session of\nCongress, right after the President delivered her second State of the\nNation Address before uh the opening of the second regular session of this\njoint Congress of the House of Representatives and the Senate\n\n\n\nAs I said the President delivered a forty-eight minute speech\napplauded seventy-four times\n\n\n\nThe President declaring war on crime terrorism and poverty a war\nthat must be won decisively if the strong Republic is to emerge at all\n\n\n\nThe President saying that the economy is strong\n\n\n\nWe are the third best-performing economy in Asia the\nbest-performing in Southeast Asia\n\n\n\nShe says that a strong Republic is one that will take care of its\npeople and its future\n\n\n\nThe President of course beginning her speech by referring to her\nfather uh the former President Diosdado Macapagal and listing her\naccomplishments as regards to the promises that she made in her SONA last\nyear\n\n\n\nUh there was one thing that stood out in that whole long list of\naccomplishments where she said that apart from UNILAB no other medicine\ncompany was giving or selling lower-priced medicines and she said that the\ngovernment would be studying punitive measures for in that regard\n\n\n\nAs soon as she had finished uh her list of accomplishments the\nPresident had said that this is just the tip of the iceberg and that she had\npromised that she would deliver and submit to Congress a formalized list of\nher accomplishments the booklet that was shown to us last week that was\nentitled \" G M A Delivered \" or \" G M A Delivers\n\n\" \n\n\n\nThe President also saying a strong Republic does what it says and\nas I said takes care of its people and its future\n\n\n\nThere was also uh a lot of focus on peace and order the need to uh\ncombat and defeat crime criminal syndicates and drug syndicates\n\n\n\nThe President there saying that the Philippine National Police will\nbe assisted by Armed Forces of the Philippines by elements intelligence and\ncombat elements of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in its fight against\nthe drug syndicates\n\n\n\nAlso the President making a joke at her own expense when she said\n\n I cannot grow taller but I can always get better  \n\n\n\nThis was of course applauded\n\n\n\nShe uh in the meantime was saying that in the future her working\nagenda was to create more job opportunities and of course to intensify the\nfight against corruption to maintain peace and order and to bring down the\ncost of power\n\n\n\nShe did say that she had ordered that the P P A be lowered be\ndecreased and uh she 's taking credit for that\n\n\n\nOf course also a a reminder to NAPOCOR and MERALCO to stop\nbickering to work together\n\n\n\nAlso the President making one of her more memorable statements\n\n\" the stone of a strong Republic \" when and she also said\n\n and I intend to be well-remembered  \n\n\n\nIn reference to the civil society groups and other sectors that\nhad joined her at EDSA  Dos  she said  I shall not\ndisappoint those who went to EDSA  \n\n\n\nAlso I suppose uh she was referring to these civil society groups\nthat had uh just recently just about two or three weeks ago been very upset\nabout the appointments or the joining the administration by the Puno  by Ronnie Ronaldo Puno and by Jaime Policarpio the President was saying\nthat she uh regrets that there were broken friendships along the way\n\n\n\nShe did also say and end her speech her her State of the Nation\nAddress by saying many of the right decisions are the tough decisions but she\ndid promise that she will lead our country towards a strong Republic\n\n\n\nShe ended with a very familiar line when she said  Stay\nwith me  uh this is something that former President Fidel Ramos had\nsaid many times before during his incumbency\n\n\n\nJing\n\n<$A> \n\n\nYeah Pia\n\n\nUh this was a a speech as you said applauded seventy-four times\n\n\nUhm was there anything new was there any issue that was new in the\nspeech other different from the speech that she delivered last year   \n,  in terms of focus\n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n Well uhm   \n\n\n\nJing uh  uh actually last year  yung  \nSONA  niya  also had a lot to do with fight against corruption\nmaintaining peace and order the fight against crime\n\n\n\nUh in a way  masasabi natin Jing na medyo hindi rin nagbago\nyung mga sinasabi ng Pangulo dahil uh sinabi na nga niya paulit-ulit no na\nkailangang pag-igtingin pa itong kampanya laban sa krimen laban sa terorismo\nat sa iba pang mga problema ng uh ng bansa  \n\n\n\nAlthough she did what made it different in a sense was that she\nkept hammering on the theme of a strong Republic and how important it is to\nbe able to put this strong Republic together building it stone by stone so\nthat we have one one full edifice\n\n\n\nJing", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2f217010-ff18-4a08-b194-968f7460938e", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\n There is something about the Araneta Coliseum rainy days in July the blaring sounds of bass drums and snare drums the blaring trumpets and it makes you say it smells like school spirit all over again\n\n\nWelcome everyone\n\n\nWe 're back for more for Season sixty-four of the U double A P\n\n\nFirst stop U P Fighting Maroons going up against the Adamson Falcons and in our second game the U S T Growling Tigers going up against our mighty host the Far Eastern University Tamaraws\n\n\nWe 're coming to you live from the Araneta Coliseum in the heart of Quezon City\n\n\nI 'm Mico Halili with Professor Randy Sacdalan by my side to welcome you to U A A P sixty-four\n\n<$B> \n\nUh partner it doesn't get  'no  it doesn't get any any better than this one you know\n\n\nYou can feel the excitement \n\n Basketball vacation is over\n\n\nIt 's time to roll out the ball and you know play some good basketball and what a game to start things off U P Fighting Maroons against Adamson Falcons\n\n\nBoy it 's gonna be one big start for sixty-four\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay we had a great time bringing you Season sixty-three last year and we expect this season to be uh to give us more fun more excitement\n\n\nFirst game U P versus Adamson two teams uh which carried the losing record last year but uh a lot of promise for the two teams involved and the two coaches as well\n\n<$B> \n\nWell of course U P went through some uh soul-searching  'no  \n\n\nThey got four wins last year but why could they not have come out stronger\n\n\nThey have some new recruits for uh the Fighting Maroons\n\n\nThey look for a better year this year they 're looking to get into the final four\n\n\nFor coach Ryan Gregorio it 's something that he has waited for more than ten months and he wants to get back uh here in the U A A P\n\n\nWhile for Luigi Trillo well it was his birthday yesterday  'no  and I think he wants a fitting tribute to the start of the season\n\n\nHe wants to get to the winning track for the Adamson Falcons\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay before we get to the two teams the two combatants this afternoon let 's explain the battlefield for U A A P sixty-four\n\n<$B> \n\nWell all the teams would have to play two games for each team total of fourteen\n\n\nSo the U P Fighting Maroons will get to play Adamson Falcons twice until the eighteenth <unclear> words </unclear> and the top four will go to the uh semi-finals wherein the top two teams one and two will play three and four with a twice-to-beat advantage for the first two teams and of course the winners will fight it out for the best-of-three championship for uh U A A P sixty-four\n\n<$A> \n\nWell a lot of people can't wait for the U A A P Final Four this year but uh we 'll go through the individual wars and battles for these teams\n\n\nAfter talking about the format let 's go through the officiating\n\n\nWe have a lot of rule changes uh this year friend\n\n<$B> \n\nWell of course the Asian Basketball Academy  chose  now to uh help the U A A P and take over, things in terms of officiating\n\n\nWell the first one the four ten-minute period is no longer played in half\n\n\nSo the teams just have to make this adjustment\n\n\nA lot of them have prepared for this\n\n\nThe eight-second back court rule similar to our M B A so it 's gonna be a faster movement from the back court to the front court and of course the three referees is an innovation in amateur basketball in the U A A P wherein you know they 've even uh invited Darrel Garretson to to help us out in the three referees\n\n\nI think that 's gonna change a lot of the rules and the way things are played in the U A A P Mico\n\n<$A> \n\nHey one thing to watch out for when you look at the referees this year is how they will position themselves\n\n\nThat was the biggest lesson they learned from veteran N B A referee Darrel Garretson when he visited and when he trained our U A A P referees\n\n\nSo watch out how they position themselves on the court and how they make the calls\n\n\nAgain a pleasant pleasant Saturday afternoon from the Big Dome, \n\n\nLet 's talk about the U P Fighting Maroons one of our combatants this afternoon U P finishing with a four and ten record good for sixth place last year but but people may not know it 's a fact that they had close games last year\n\n<$B> \n\nWell the point that you 're raising Mico is the six to ten losses there were four four points in <unclear> 1 word </unclear> but the biggest deficit that they yielded was ten points  'no  \n\n\nFor a team to go out on a losing record with that kind of a a margin you know you can't help but feel you know it 's okay it 's okay  'no  \n\n\nYou gave it your all\n\n\nThere were no blown-out games for them and they got into three overtime games and look they the sixty-eight point eight points per game is you know is something that uh <unclear> 2 words </unclear> \n\n\nIt 's not the way that U P played the game that yielded most number of points to the opponents but it 's how really how they played the game and how they lost by a very little margin through the sixty-third U A A P\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay we 're about to talk about two young men who made strong impressions last year\n\n\nWe 're talking about uh Michael Bravo and Robson Bornancin\n\n\nThe U P community calls them the Killer Bees\n\n\nBravo a former San Beda Red Cap Bornancin coming out of the Brent basketball system\n\n\nImpressive numbers for Bornancin most especially as a rookie\n\n<$B> \n\nUh yes he almost made it as Rookie of the Year for Rob Bornancin and for Michael Bravo it was really a coming out year\n\n\nHe was able to get the confidence of uh uh Ryan  Gregorio and the rest of uh the team but you know the trouble with Bornancin he 's very young with his third worst three point six errors but that could be forgiven\n\n\nNow you 're looking at a tougher Rob Bornancin a more intelligent player and Michael Bravo I think very very confident\n\n\nThis young man  'no  he has established himself as the shootingest of the Maroons and an heir to uh Paulo Mendoza for the U P Fighting Maroons\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so those are the dependables for uh coach Ryan Gregorio\n\n\nLet 's talk about uh players we did not see last year but could have a big impact for the Maroons this year\n\n\nPatrick Madarang was part of U P before uh he left after uh he left for a year and then we 're about to meet Kenneth Robin uhm this find of uh of the U P coaching staff from Cebu\n\n\nThese are two players who just might be the difference between a losing record and a slot in the final four\n\n<$B> \n\nWell Patrick Madarang <unclear> words </unclear> this is his last year in the U A A P\n\n\nNo more Edric Ferrer they could be looking for leadership from Patrick Madarang  'no  \n\n\nHe brings about the seniority and stability in the line-up\n\n\nFor Kenneth Robin of course I can see him from this distance as  'no  uh we were told a lot of uh baby fat still surrounding his uh   elbows well he shows a lot of promise and U P went  into a runner-up finish uh last in the last Philippine Youth Basketball League\n\n\nThat should make it very exciting for this young ball club from U P Diliman\n\n<$A> \n\n     E  a lot of observers have said that U P was just a big <unclear> 1 word </unclear> in the court last year of making a better uh impression or getting a better record after season sixty-three\n\n\nSo that 's for U P a lot of promise for this team\n\n\nIt 's a bigger team a more experienced team so a lot to watch out for for the U P Fighting Maroons\n\n\nLet 's switch over to the other side the Adamson Falcons led by the youthful head coach Luigi Trillo\n\n\nThey learned as a team they had they learned a lot of lessons from last year 's debacle\n\n<$B> \n\nSo too much a pain to handle for from last year\n\n\nGoing uh winless in one season and the last win coming in August nineteen nineteen ninety-nine at uh over uh F E U but you know look at that uh team things for for Adamson  'no  they 're so much down at the basement  'no  there 's no other direction for them but up\n\n\nThe losing margin thirteen point eight is the biggest margin\n\n\nThey were last in this very important statistical department and you know they 're really looking forward into this uh season they wanna get back to\n\n\nThey had several close ball games last year\n\n\nI remember one overtime game against U S T\n\n\nIt was there but they missed out on the three free throws could not extend it to the second overtime and uh who knows this might be the game to start things right for the Falcons\n\n\nIt could be a break-out season for them very young uh squad for the Adamson\n\n<$A> \n\nCoach Luigi Trillo will rely on the leadership of Melvin Mamaclay\n\n\nUh you 're about to see his numbers\n\n\nMamaclay had nine point two points per game four point six rebounds per outing\n\n\nUh he is one one of the dependable holdovers for coach Trillo\n\n<$B> \n\nWell he won't be uh well so many guys have graduated the likes of Bruce Lee uh no more  uh Cris Eusebio no longer in the team but Mamaclay well he was in the line-up of Welcoat who was <unclear> 1 word </unclear> the last champions in the last P B L so that should put some stability into his ball game Melvin Mamaclay\n\n\nPlus you know the rookies would be looking for uh Mamaclay 's leadership on the floor  'no  \n\n\nHe he could not afford to do mistakes as you take a look at uh the good players for Adamson\n\n<$A> \n\nWhen we talked with coach Luigi Trillo during the free season he was so excited about his youngsters Mark Abadia Steve Rolan and Ramil Tagupa\n\n<$B> \n\nWhen I look at Rolan now I could remember him him in the Junior P B L\n\n\nHe 's a stocky guy who could do things \n\n That 's Melvin Mamaclay for you \n\n So Mark Abadia who plays number two is one exciting guy that they got from uh Cebu Mico\n\n\nI think we 'll have the numbers of uh we have the numbers of uh Mark Abadia later on and then Tagupa plays the one for the Adamson Falcons  'no  \n\n\nIt 's a new team they went into the <unclear> 3 words </unclear> in preparation for this U A A P\n\n\nI think they 're gonna go better\n\n\nThey 're gonna go still on the triangle offense on the part of Luigi Trillo 's uh philosophy for the Adamson Falcons\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay we 'll talk more about this first game of season sixty-four between the Adamson Falcons and the U P Fighting Maroons when the U A A P returns here on Studio twenty-three\n\n\n Friends welcome back to the Big Dome the Araneta Coliseum and the return of the U A A P here on Studio twenty-three\n\n\nWe have with us to complete our team our student  courtside reporters\n\n\nOf course the U P community will be represented ably by Mr Jorell Legaspi and then Adamson will be represented by Aileen Sabiaga two new faces that you 'll get used to throughout the duration of U A A P sixty-four\n\n\nWe 'll start with this Gentext report on the U P Fighting Maroons courtesy of Jorell\n\n\nJorell good afternoon  \n\n\nAbsolutely perfect report from Jorell uh Legaspi uh and now uh let 's go turn over to the reporter from Adamson uh Ms Aileen Sabiaga\n\n\nGood afternoon Aileen  \n\n\nOkay it appears we 'll have to wait for a second for that\n\n\nTalking about U P uh again a lot of promise for uh for this young team\n\n\nA lot of close losses last year but uh three key big key additions big man wise for coach Ryan Gregorio\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's right  'no  Robin will put Bornancin in a more familiar position for him that will be three and four\n\n\nSo he won't be tendering much of the boards but looking really to score his numbers  'no  and I think that 's one big advantage for U P\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay let 's go quickly to Ms Aileen Sabiaga from the Adamson side Aileen  \n\n\nI think that is one thing these two young coaches will do a lot of this year and that is to communicate with their players\n\n\nUh coach Ryan Gregorio and coach Luigi Trillo two of the most vocal most emotional coaches we have in the U A A P\n\n<$B> \n\nI think they 're very good at that you know considering that they 're also broadcasters themselves  'no   \n\n\nThe power of communication is very much inside them\n\n\nAnd I think it 's the chemistry of the new players blending with the veterans that 's gonna put that '' be given premium at least for this game  'no  the Adamson with five holdovers the rest new players\n\n\nBoy that 's gonna need a lot of chemistry to happen if they want to pull one over U P this afternoon\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's a new year\n\n\nIt 's a new season for these two teams hoping to redeem themselves from disappointing season last year\n\n\nMike Bravo he will be in charge of providing the scoring sock for the fighting Maroons\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yes and uh U P starters mainly are the holdovers Bravo Jomaleza Celo Bornancin and Santos\n\n\nYou know they wanna make sure that no many not too many mistakes to start things for uh coach Ryan Gregorio while for uh Adamson well that you 're looking at coach Ryan Gregorio\n\n\nI think he 's more subdued at the start of the season  ,  for   now  \n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n he has more time to prepare that 's the difference\n\n<$B> \n\nRight right\n\n<$A> \n\nFrom last year he mentioned that he was really too weak to be able to prepare his team now no no reason for them to uh start things cold\n\n\nWhile for Adamson it 's really a very young team\n\n\nTwo rookies or actually three rookies in the first five of coach Luigi Trillo in Tagupa Rolan and Abadia so only Yong and Mangulabnan we don't even have a Mamaclay in the first five of Adamson", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThe Archers managing to survive a scare by the Blue Eagles at many occasions during the course of the first half\n\n<$B> \n\nEspecially when Tenorio got into the ball game and scored with about eight points\n\n\nBut unluckily for Ateneo Ateneo got into foul trouble and Fonacier has his own uh highlighting the first half \n\n\nBut still Wilson and Ritualo I think they carried the load heavily for De La Salle while we 're still waiting for Rico Alvarez to sign on with three fouls to erupt in the second half\n\n<$A> \n\nBut you know, definitely blue becomes you today\n\n\nI must say that you were wise to wear blue here today\n\n<$B> \n\n Oh yes I I 've to think about the uh situation of the  I have to blend with your group\n\n<$A> \n\n Okay okay\n\n\nBut uh this game is being fought so ferociously by both sides\n\n<$B> \n\nUh uh\n\n<$A> \n\nThe foul trouble might be the key and the free throw shooting might be the areas where it could spell the difference\n\n<$B> \n\nOh  sa  free throw shooting for example Sev  'no  it 's uh eighty-nine percent by La Salle\n\n\nThey made seventeen points on nineteen tries while Ateneo only made ten out of eighteen from the free throw line\n\n\nThat could spell the difference\n\n\nRight now it 's the difference in the first half\n\n<$A> \n\nIn terms of defense both have tried to draw the press \n\n<$B> \n\nUh yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nAteneo managed to break it\n\n\nLa Salle also managed to break it  sino ang matibay ang resistensya  might be also a difference here in the game\n\n<$B> \n\nUh La Salle we 're looking at two point guards only for La Salle\n\n\nIt 's uh Mike Cortez and Eric Arijola with matching Joseph Yong for uh De La Salle Cholo Villanueva the other rookie is not playing today\n\n\nFor Ateneo L A Tenorio would certainly be the difference for Ateneo, \n\n\nAteneo is a different team without L A Tenorio I mean uh\n\n<$A> \n\nThey do move a little better the fluidity is there\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$A> \n\nBut they 're you 're so correct they are not the same team when Tenorio is down on the bench because of three personal fouls\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n\nBecause they 're confident that Tenorio can bring down that leather unlike when they pressed Gimko and Tanchie there 's really a very good chance that they might lose the ball from the back court so if Tenorio uh watches his fouls and gets to play on the court majority of the second half I think Ateneo will be okay\n\n<$A> \n\nBy the same token La Salle is a different team when Ritualo has to sit down on the bench\n\n\nWe take a look at some of the significant numbers\n\n\nWe take a, red ballpen you 're the teacher here also and we circle some important numbers my friend\n\n<$B> \n\nWell both of us uh belong to the academe Sev so  I don't have a monopoly of the title \" professor \" here  \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nThirty-six percent shooting for La Salle but today they atoned for that uh eighty-nine percent free throw shooting that 's actually fifty-six percent and eighty-nine percent free throw shooting\n\n\nAteneo did better from the field but only shot ten of eighteen from the free throw line\n\n\nAteneo had one rebound better but the turnovers it favored De La Salle forty turnovers committed by the Ateneo and only eight for De La Salle\n\n<$A> \n\nJolly Paz we mentioned earlier was thinking about quickness the pace of the ballgame, \n\n\nIt looks like it does favor La Salle when it 's wide open court basketball that 's where Ritualo likes it and that 's where Tenorio   likes it  but it 's just that he cannot stay on the floor for long\n\n<$B> \n\n Oh   \n\n\nOh yes that 's that 's that 's correct Sev about uh about La Salle  'no  they want open  \n\n\nThey have the men to do that, \n\n\nFor Ateneo they 're just feeling it the strength of Ateneo is still Rich Alvarez, and Rico Villanueva\n\n\nUnfortunately Rainier has not yet hit his stride Membrere only Fonacier I recall and Tenorio has hit shots from the three-point area\n\n\nThey need a lot more to free up the uh play offensively for Rico and Rich downstairs\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd just for the information of everybody I also brought a green shirt just in case \n\n \n\n\nYou also have your green shirt with you\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yes uh just to make sure for insurance Sev\n\n<$A> \n\nIn the meantime the uh Blue Babble Battalion is on the floor right now with their all-halftime  palabas  \n\n\nThis is just getting better and better year after year\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yes the way uh and some people say that we 're the only teams just La Salle and Ateneo\n\n\nI hate to say we 're <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\n Wala e 'kala mo nagkuwentuhan lang 'no  \n\n<$B> \n\nIn fairness to our other members in the broadcast panel La Salle and Ateneo they 've stuck to the tradition of cheers while the other cheerers really you 're a the real cheer leader yourself Sev <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nLong time ago\n\n<$B> \n\nBut La Salle and Ateneo they 've stuck with the tradition of cheering and that 's what the U A A P is all about\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd the big thing that has developed here is because because these two universities which became co-educational some time in the seventies have now accepted that women are part definitely of the halftime  palabas  and I think rightfully so\n\n\nIn fact the Ateneo  palabas  right now even has their grade school cheer leaders on the floor right now\n\n\n  So it is the  whole uh community so to speak\n\n<$B> \n\n    That 's right and uh it 's a good thing for Ateneo really to have the the women also participating in their cheering squad\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay and uh you 're very nice to me today I noticed\n\n\nIn the uh meantime talking about community we have for the Ateneo Blue Eagles Patty Laurel with this Gentext update\n\n\nTake it away Patty  \n\n\nThanks a lot Patty and uh it is indeed up to the Ateneans to bounce back because La Salle they are not just going to give away this game and their championship\n\n\nThey 're looking for number four\n\n\nNo question about it\n\n<$B> \n\nThey 're gonna work very hard for that and the same with Ateneo\n\n\nAteneo wanted to break into the championship  'no  \n\n\nThey 've been in the Final Four for a couple of years now and you know this could be the big year for them\n\n\nAnd and I I 've anticipated you know, \n\n\nWe missed the La Salle Ateneo dream match-up last year\n\n\nF E U got in the way but so many teams wanted that and I think hard work would really be the the point for all the teams here in the sixty-fourth U A A P\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat are the other teams seeing here like U S T\n\n\nI see uh some players and some of the coaches from F E U and U S T\n\n\nWhat are they seeing here\n\n<$B> \n\nWell one it 's a different La Salle team that they 're looking at\n\n\nUh it 's it 's becoming a Renren Ritualo show eighteen points for Renren Ritualo and I think that 's gonna be one factor that Franz Pumaren may be happy at this point but be unhappy later on because you have the countdown on Renren Ritualo\n\n\nHe  can't score eighteen points  'no  La Salle would not want him to do that\n\n\nFor Ateneo it 's becoming terrible for the other teams because they now have the last piece of the puzzle which is a point guard  'no  \n\n\nIt 's just a matter of time before Rico and Rich Alvarez combine together and really make the, defense very difficult against Ateneo because he 's gonna, scatter the entire defense \n\n We have the outside game of Tenorio and uh and Rainier Sison complementing Alvarez Boguia and uh Villanueva inside\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's three and four positions seems to be at  Ateneo 's advantage in this game at the point \n\n And at the four position La Salle seems to have the clear edge in the game at least if we take out Tenorio from the equation of course\n\n<$B> \n\nYes of course but uh Tenorio 's part of the equation\n\n\nWe could only take him out if he has more than uh if he commits his fifth foul or fourth foul early in the third period\n\n\nBut, Ateneo would need to start Tenorio in the third quarter, \n\n\nIt 's very pivotal for Ateneo but of course Tenorio would have to watch out  'no  he wanted an exciting ball game 'till the end Sev\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd our full schedule of games we will be presenting majority of the games in the course of the U A A P season and I 'm sure the other teams will see this is the level not just because it 's Ateneo and La Salle but the level in which they must play to be able to go up against these two teams  \n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's clear they 're watching the game between La Salle and Ateneo \n\n Of course everybody every team in the U A A P wants La Salle 's head \n\n They 're the defending champions they don't want to make another uh occasion wherein U S T in the nineties bagged the four consecutive championships\n\n\nThe rest of the teams they don't want that to happen to La Salle\n\n\nOf course La Salle wanted it\n\n\nFor Ateneo it 's been a long time since eighty-seven and eighty-eight for Danny and company that they wanted\n\n<$A> \n\nI wonder who the center of that team was as  you take a look at director Fritz Infante who uh helped direct our opening  palabas  also and there of course well Ateneo La Salle\n\n\nHe 's on the La Salle side of the the floor\n\n\nBut you 're right about the other aspect uh the big alumni so to speak  yung mga  in government politics and business they 're all around and all the pretty girls from a different time a different era  \n\n\nMy classmates are here they they 're my batch from high school seventy-four, they said uh to kill you but I said you 're a nice guy really but you know uh they said uh can you at least try\n\n<$B> \n\nI have an Atenean father so  he 's high school fifty-four partner\n\n<$A> \n\n So that neutralizes the whole thing okay\n\n\nI told you he 's a very nice guy\n\n\nIn the meantime  forty-seven the Bob Novales formula say the score when you 're too happy forty-seven to forty-one  is is the count as we begin the second half of play\n\n\nwe are so glad you could join all of us here today in this very special presentation on Studio twenty-three U A A P sixty-fourth season second day of competition\n\n\nYes I believe we have to jump again  Wow tall line-up together with Cortez and Ritualo\n\n\nRitualo circles around a huge pick by Ramos finds himself open gets a good look unable to sink it  \n\n \n\n<$B> \n\nOh yes  ibang-iba yung  level\n\n<$A> \n\nThat was a plain steal Ritualo is gone\n\n<$B> \n\nAny markers for Renren Ritualo  \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd that was sort of expected when you have Ritualo if you can bottle him up maybe it will help your cause\n\n\nIn the meantime here comes Membrere across the time line applies the breaks\n\n\nSison sends it over to uh Tenorio\n\n\nIn the meantime Rico Villanueva got a foul\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom Santa Maria doubling up on Rico Villanueva  third foul on uh Adonis\n\n<$A> \n\nAnd that 's a clear Smart Zed steal Smart Zed the power to live the life you choose\n\n\nSmart Zed your telephone now  \n\n\nIt 's Enrico Villanueva outside to Membrere <unclear> 1 word </unclear> connection with Tenorio there\n\n\nIn the meantime there 's a foul \n\n La Salle will have another and that is on Michael Reyno\n\n<$B> \n\nSecond team foul now for uh La Salle, \n\n\nIt' s a difficult match-up for Vainio he 's covering uh Rainier Sison\n\n\nVainio used to play the  foreign  five in high school but he has to contend with somebody like Rainier Sison \n\n\n  And from the outside  he moves very well from the outside\n\n<$A> \n\n  Na magalaw    \n\n, \n\n\nThere 's Alvarez altering his pace drives hard loses his control of the ball, Santa Maria was not exactly going to give him an open lane\n\n\nBut look at this Tenorio with a heist up up up and away\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's gonna make Cortez think about dribbling in front of Tenorio  \n\n<$A> \n\nTenorio may be feeling right now I 'm on a bit of borrowed time and the coaching staff I 'm sure told him  huwag kang susundot pag alanganin  \n\n\nCortez managing to get it to Santa Maria\n\n\nSanta Maria starts his drive to the basket blocked by Villanueva but there 's a foul prior to that block\n\n\nOuch we missed George during halftime\n\n\nNow we would get an opportunity to chat with George in this Gentext update  \n\n\nExcellent report uh George and of course I 'm not surprised that La Salle is a bit worried about what Tenorio can do as far as damage to their cause is concerned\n\n<$B> \n\nIf La Salle doesn't figure it out he could be this big in his first game in the U A A P  \n\n\nHere 's Rich Alvarez seeing his wide opening unable to fill in that gap decides to slow down Membrere switches it over to Tenorio who cuts up the inside but to no avail  \n\n Rico Villanueva can't get to it he 's beaten to the punch that time by Ramos", "subdomain":

to Estrada\n\n\nTubid to Ronquillo back to Tubid now it 's Yap Yap dribble drive up to Tubid open for three passes it up for Ronquillo from the corner air ball here comes Bornancin on the fast break four on three fast break Bornancin and the pass to Bravo is bobbled with a traveling violation\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd that time Bornancin made the wrong decision\n\n\nHe was free for that uh lay-up but he opted to pass to Bravo, \n\n\nA lot of Maroon shirts here and Bravo just bobbled the ball off the pass\n\n<$A> \n\nOnce more still four two Ronquillo breaks it up now it 's Yap out to Tubid Tubid in a motion for three nice pass to Almenario who drew the foul and the fake\n\n<$B> \n\nGood ball movement that time by U E because it 's not it 's not necessary Jude for you to shoot from three point down three when you 're facing a zone defense that time good inside pass by uh Tubid to Almenario\n\n<$A> \n\nSo quick substitution for the Maroons\n\n\nCelo goes in the ball game to replace Robin\n\n\nSo Coach Gregorio I guess that that 's the same thing to say uh  \n\n\nCoach Gregorio saves the tall line-up for the Fighting Maroons as Almenario hits his first Gentext free throw brought to you by Gentext by Globe Handy phone the official privilege card of the U A A P games\n\n<$B> \n\nI think that U P can afford to put in a tall line-up like this because there 's a lot of big guys in this line-up like Bornancin and Santos even though they 're playing the forward positions they pretty much can be defense guards\n\n<$A> \n\nNow U P brings it across they 're down by four six two is our score Nunag pass to Santos doesn't take the shot back to Nunag now it 's Santos double team on the corner Santos cross court and open Aby Nunag for three\n\n<$B> \n\nThe whistle off the ball Almenario came sprawling to the ground so I guess there 's a foul off on the U P Fighting Maroons or is it on   Almenario  so double block time for Almenario\n\n<$A> \n\n Almenario   \n\n So we see a lot of action off the ball early on\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd both teams are putting an emphasis on their defense the first few minutes of this game\n\n<$A> \n\nNunag dribble drive spin move passes it to Tubid foot race is on against Bravo\n\n\nRonald Tubid slams it home\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's the problem if you don't have a natural point guard Nunag turning the ball over\n\n<$A> \n\nThat brings Jomalesa off the bench Nunag out to Bornancin\n\n\nBornancin surveys the situation out to Nunag once again this is Santos from seventeen feet out\n\n\nSantos fakes great defense by Estrada\n\n\nSantos forces it up draws the foul  \n\n\nHere 's that high endurance slam by Ronald Tubid brought to you by high endurance Old Spice and a sure shot slam dunk from Ronald Tubid\n\n<$B> \n\nMaybe Ronald Tubid can also join the U A A P track and field uh meets\n\n<$A> \n\nFor high jump for high jump, \n\n\nSantos misses the first free throw\n\n\nFree throws brought to you by Gentext Globe Handy phone the official privilege card of the U A A P games <unclear> words </unclear> takes the second eight three our score\n\n\nRonquillo brings it up for U E out to Yap\n\n\nThis is Tubid now back to Yap still a zone defense by U P this is Estrada back to Ronquillo open for three \n\n And they still have not solved that zone defense \n\n A nice save by Almenario to Tubid and they got a fresh twenty-four second shot clock \n\n Ronquillo out to Tubid\n\n\nTubid tries a stab at three still not there the long rebound back to the Warriors out to Yap\n\n\nHe tries the three and he misses the three\n\n\nSo the shooting percentage of U E very low here they pass to Bornancin and a cut\n\n\nThere 's the two free throws\n\n<$B> \n\nDuring that last possession U E missing three three pointers from three different men and Ronquillo who is normally a good outside shooter missing two three pointers\n\n<$A> \n\nThere 's that pass to Bornancin and those were good three point shots for the Warriors actually\n\n\nI mean if you 're a coach Coach Boysie Zamar in fact they cannot fault those shots\n\n<$B> \n\nThat time I 'm sure Coach Boysie Zamar telling Tubid and James Yap if you get shots like that again you should take it\n\n<$A> \n\nRobson Bornancin gets the two rebounds out of Brent high school, second one in and out\n\n<$B> \n\nThere is a lane violation against Almenario, \n\n<$A> \n\nRobson Bornancin only averaging five points per game\n\n\nHe 'll have to put that up to around double digits for U P to be a threat\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's not even half of his average last year Jude, Bornancin averaging close to twelve points a game last year\n\n<$A> \n\nAlmenario back to Tubid eight five is our score three point lead for the Warriors Yap out to Ronquillo back to Tubid\n\n\nNow it 's Yap once again five on the shot clock spin move double team out to nobody and that 's a turn-over\n\n<$B> \n\nWell U E hasn't scored in the last few minutes \n\n Eight five is our score three-point lead for the Warriors \n\n \n\n<$A> \n Ateneo gym\n\n The U P Fighting Maroons down by three\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd every now and then alumni former players of the teams come and watch here in the U A A P and that 's a former U E player\n\n\n<unclear> name </unclear> who now plays for the Batangas Blades in the M B A\n\n<$A> \n\nHe played for U E by the way for people who uh  who weren't sure he never mentioned his  alma mater  \n\n\nCall on another foul off the ball here against Ronald Tubid, that 's number two on Tubid\n\n<$B> \n\nSo two quick fouls on uh Ronald Tubid\n\n<$A> \n\nCorrection that 's on Estrada rather so that 's number two on Estrada and he 'll be replaced and will sit on the bench\n\n\nLet 's go over to China Jocson for Gentext update  \n\n\nThanks China\n\n<$B> \n\nThe important thing with that start with this start of U E Jude is their defensive start \n\n U P only five points in over in almost six minutes of this game\n\n<$A> \n\nWell we covered one game where the U P fighting Maroons only scored two points against the blue corner against the Blue Eagles against Ateneo\n\n<$B> \n\nYes indeed\n\n<$A> \n\nHere 's Tubid open again from the corner and U E is just shooting blanks here\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's probably the fourth uh air ball <unclear> 1 word </unclear> for U E in this game\n\n<$A> \n\nLet alone the other non air ball misses, Ronquillo out to Tubid dribble drive inside out to Almenario from fifteen feet back to Omiping and he won't even get an opportunity to have that three-pointer down as a three-second violation is called\n\n<$B> \n\nThat time Almenario was wide open fifteen footer\n\n\nHe should he should have taken that shot\n\n<$A> \n\nCervantes now in the ball game replacing Santos\n\n\nJomalesa brings it up against Ronquillo\n\n\nHe wants Celo inside ready to double team still gets in there against Almenario now it 's Bravo back to Celo Celo takes his post move <unclear> 1 word </unclear> not there nice follow by Cervantes\n\n<$B> \n\nSo that 's that is where U P is dominant against uh U E in the previous game rebounding\n\n<$A> \n\nRonquillo from the corner gets into a clearing Omiping inside to Almenario back to Omiping bobbles the ball all the way in a corner to Tubid back to Ronquillo another open three pointer another miss\n\n\nThe ball is with Bornancin three on two fast break pass to Bravo this time he doesn't bobble and dunks it in\n\n<$B> \n\nThis time Bornancin makes the right decision in that three on two fast break \n\n He drops it off to the open Bravo\n\n<$A> \n\nU P has taken the lead nine eight \n\n Tubid with the ball on the corner he 's gonna try another one no he 's not Omiping out to Tubid Tubid a long two pointer he was bumped no call\n\n U E with the ball now it 's Jomalesa ahead to Bornancin Bornancin out to Jomalesa that 's the time for the shot clock U P up by one\n\n\nBornancin against Omiping makes his move dribble drive back to Jomalesa five on the shot clock\n\n\nJomalesa loses control and we 've got a jump ball\n\n<$B> \n\nSo far Jude U P winning this gamble playing their zone defense and daring the U E players to shoot from the outside\n\n<$A> \n\nSo twenty-seven left in the first quarter\n\n\nU P has taken the lead \n\n Smart Zed assist from Robson Bornancin right to Mike Bravo the power to live the life you choose\n\n\nSmart Zed your cell phone now\n\n<$B> \n\n You know Jude I was impressed with this uh Smart Zed thing because uh yesterday when I was in uh Pampanga they were sending me up to the minute updates about that uh of the Ateneo N U game\n\n<$A> \n\nYes indeed so if you 've got a Smart phone I think uh the steps U A A P space news to two one one or two eight eight I think it 's two one one  \n\n\nI get confused now or p k g U A A P at the same number and you 'll get uh timely updates and I think this game is also being updated\n\n\nTwo twenty-five left \n\n U P in the lead in the ball Madarang already in the ball game for the Maroons remember he exploded for twenty-four points last time out Celo and he commits an offensive foul\n\n<$B> \n\nBoth teams in the penalty now\n\n\nHere 's Rodel Celo lowering his shoulder\n\n<$A> \n\nU E wants to get the lead back \n\n Booker with the ball out to Omiping and a foul will be called on Jomalesa\n\n<$B> \n\nGood Jude good substitution here by Coach Boysie Zamar\n\n\nNow he has three new players to shoot from the outside in Booker Omiping and Paul Artadi\n\n<$A> \n\nThe way they 've been shooting so far they definitely need a lot of help from the perimeter\n\n\nWe mentioned this before this is the kind of team that really lives and dies by how they shoot from the perimeter as Omiping hits his first Gentext free throw\n\n\nOlivar Omiping gets the second\n\n\nJomalesa pushes it up gets past Artadi, Bornancin out to  Madarang inside to Celo once again cross court to Jomalesa left-handed dribble drive to Booker\n\n\nBooker stole it away two on one fast break Booker nice bounce pass to Artadi for two points\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's the perfect way to win a two in one fast break\n\n<$A> \n\nJomalesa a little bit wild here gets to Celo double team out on the corner Madarang and he picks up his pivot foot making his move\n\n<$B> \n\nSo U E Jude scoring a lot of points here in the early going because of their defense so even though they 're struggling from the field they 're still up by three points\n\n<$A> \n\nBooker surveys the situation passes to Omiping Omiping to Artadi Artadi dribble drive out to Omiping to Booker\n\n\nBooker drives inside to Almenario from the baseline took it, four points for Almenario full court pressure once again for the Warriors, Madarang back to Jomalesa five-point lead now for U E less than a minute left in the first quarter and Jomalesa ill-advised three pointer there\n\n\nU E now a chance to extend a five-point lead \n\n Artadi to Omiping back to Artadi from the corner open for three another air ball for the Warriors \n\n Ahead to Jomalesa it 's a foot race again Booker Jomalesa that double bounce is missed\n\n\nHere comes U E with only thirty seconds left in the first quarter Artadi the pass to Booker Booker for three still misses the shot Bornancin with the board\n\n<$B> \n\nU E way off with their three-point attempts\n\n<$A> \n\nAhead to Cervantes ther 's about a two second differential between the shot clock and the game clock \n\n Jomalesa against Artadi wants Celo inside gets him inside Celo cross court and there 's a foul on Masbang off the ball so we 'll have two free throws for Madarang\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know Jude U P trying to go to Rodel Celo in the low post but Celo as we take a look at this fast break first by U E\n\n<$A> \n\nSmart Zed assist from Booker the power to live the life you choose\n\n\nSmart Zed your cell phone now\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd Jude I was mentioning Celo does not have the footwork or the moves to attract that double teaming in the post so U E 's been doing a pretty good job at defending against Celo\n\n<$A> \n\nMadarang gets the first Gentext free throw brought to you by Gentext by Globe Handy phone the official privilege card of the U A A P Games  \n\n Second one on the way and he misses it\n\n\nWe got eight seconds to get a shot up \n\n Here 's Booker dribble drive against Celo that double bounce\n\n\nIt 's still a miss but did he draw a foul\n\n\nYes he did so he 's gonna have two free throws\n\n\nThe foul will be on uh Celo\n\n\nThat 's number two\n\n\nHere 's that challenge by Booker going inside\n\n<$B> \n\nBooker coming off the bench sure adding a lot of spark a lot of hustle for the U E Warriors\n\n<$A> \n\nWe got a substitution\n\n\nAlmenario will sit on the bench replacing him will be Butel, \n\n\nArnold Booker, one of the spark plugs for the U E Red Warriors misses the first free throw \n\n Just four point four seconds left here in the first quarter fourteen ten is our score U E up by four, a big challenge to it\n\n\nU P 's got four seconds here Bornancin with the ball you can see the time remaining Madarang a long three pointer and it 's off right so after ten minutes of play a five-point lead for the Red Warriors\n\n\nFifteen ten is our score\n\n\nWe 'll be back with a second after these messages\n\n\nEvery now and then the alumni or certain alumnus of your school this time it 's from U P\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd Jude with the uh U P uh scoring only ten points maybe they need Paulo Mendoza to suit up for this for this game  \n\n\nThis guy I know can  score thirty points uh he used to score thirty points in the U A A P", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c978db89-3c84-4d5c-a60f-033c9540ccf9", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.173861+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\n Starting line ups of both squads, being announced right now, \n\n\nI think Ateneo Blue Eagles right there\n\n<$B> \n\nCoach Joe Lipa likes to start the game with uh Edward Quimpo for as a point guard for uh for Ateneo \n\n\nWell he holds the key \n\n\nL A uh L A Tenorio comes in but you know we 're looking at Abadia but it 's Tagupa who 'll be covering uh Quimpo as a point guard \n\n And first possession goes to Blue Eagles \n\n<$A> \n\nSo first possession for Ateneo it 's now the starting line up you see the graphic \n\n\nMembrere throws it away to Tagupa \n\n\nTagupa pushing it up against Quimpo \n\n\nTagupa nice cross over the hoop hooks it up backs it out \n\n\nMangulabnan with the follow up\n\n<$B> \n\nTagupa making uh well well over Quimpo but offensive board \n\n\nIt 's two points for the Falcons\n\n<$A> \n\nQuimpo against Tagupa Ateneo second offensive set they built it over last time \n\n\nHere 's Sison inside to Villanueva \n\n\nNo double team \n\n\nSison open for three \n\n\nThat 's long \n\n\nRebound to Yong \n\n\nAdamson up and running once again \n\n\nYong, rolls it down to Tagupa \n\n\nTwo to nothing is our score Quimpo and against Villanueva inside into the lay-up \n\n\nFollowed by Villanueva \n\n\nVillanueva brings it up to Membrere who loses control \n\n\nHere comes Tagupa \n\n\nOne on three fast break and Tagupa says I need some teammates\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's a a good decision Jude \n\n\nHe doesn't have the numbers\n\n<$A> \n\nBacked out\n\n<$B> \n\nHe waited for the head of the Falcons \n\n\nLet 's go over to Aileen Soriaga\n\n<$A> \n\nAileen Soriaga for Gentext update\n\n<$C> \n\nYes thank you very much guys \n\n\nIn spite of their three consecutive losses the Adamson Falcons are still very much eager and optimistic that they will be able to win this ballgame over the Ateneo Blue Eagles \n\n\nBut the boys they know that they are off for a big fight and they have to work hard and they have and they need to have dedication to win this ballgame \n\n\nMore than just a game plan Coach Luigi Trillo also reminded his boys that they they need to put more heart into their game and more and the heat and the heat itself will start carrying above their need \n\n\nEven the players themselves were not that satisfied with their last year performances especially during <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nBut this time around they 're hoping that they will be able to win \n\n\nGuys back to you\n\n<$B> \n\nThanks Aileen, \n\n<$A> \n\nSo confidence is one of the problems for Adamson so far \n\n\nRolan nice rebound but there 's a whistle\n\n<$B> \n\nCould be a foul could be on Membrere trying to go or could it be on uh Villanueva who <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n Here 's Enrico Villanueva will hold that ball\n\n<$A> \n\nWell Villanueva picks up his first foul \n\n\nLet 's take a look at this Smart Zed steal by Tagupa \n\n\nSmart Zed the power to live the life you choose \n\n\nSmart Zed your cell phone now \n\n\nAnd Adamson Rolan gets his two points from the field \n\n\nLet 's go over to the Ateneo side this time with Patty Laurel for Gentext update\n\n<$D> \n\nYes uh earlier on I spoke to coach Lipa and I asked him what does he have to fear from Adamson \n\n\nAnd he told me you know that overconfidence can kill sometimes\n\n\nThat 's why he always tells his boys to treat each game as if it were a big team \n\n\nAdamson is very hungry for a win \n\n\nWe should not allow them to win just at our expense \n\n\nWith more reason we should watch out for that \n\n\nSo today 's definitely gonna be a good fight between Ateneo and Adamson \n\n\nBack to you Jude and Randy \n\n<$A> \n\nThanks Patty and uh overconfidence is definitely something that uh the better teams have uh to watch out for here \n\n\nThese Gentext free throws by Villanueva brought to you by Gentext by Globe handy phone the official privilege card of the U A A P Games\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> continue for Enrico Villanueva for his first free throw \n\n\nActually the pressure is not on Adamson but so much on Ateneo \n\n\nI feel Jude that this situation is very clear to Adamson I think \n\n\nAll year long they 've not picked up a win so it 's not really very difficult for them \n\n\nAteneo really feels the pressure right now <unclear> words </unclear> as the quarter passes\n\n\nBut you know they should treat this game like any other ball game they have to win it on the court play your basketball even against the Adamson Falcons at the bottom of the standings\n\n<$A> \n\nTagupa against Quimpo \n\n\nTagupa all the way inside misses the lay-up \n\n\nVillanueva gives it to Sison \n\n\nHere comes Ateneo \n\n\n<unclear> 1 word </unclear> to the side with the three-pointer \n\n\nMembrere out to Quimpo across to Sison \n\n\nInside Villanueva \n\n\nVillanueva makes his move the half move from the baseline is good\n\n<$B> \n\nThis is definitely gonna be a very difficult match-up for Rolan because he doesn't really have that jumping ability to cover Rico Villanueva \n\n\nThe most that he could do is try to push him outside of the shaded area \n\n<$A> \n\nThe lead is down to one \n\n\nAbadia the fake the shot \n\n\nGood, good shot\n\n<$B> \n\nHe shoots over Membrere \n\n\nThe person <unclear> words </unclear> in offense \n\n\nBut not a good sign for the Blue Eagles \n\n<$A> \n\nAbadia scored twenty-four in that first game \n\n\nAnd as you mentioned probably the next two \n\n\nSison drops a three-pointer but it 's not gonna go and there 's a foul\n\n<$B> \n\nIt will go against the Falcons, \n\n\nMichael Yong picking up his first foul \n\n\nAnd the second team foul against Adamson \n\n<$A> \n\nMichael Yong one of the very few holdovers from last year \n\n\nLuigi has eleven rookies in his line-up \n\n\nCross court to Villanueva \n\n\nThis is the match-up they want to exploit \n\n\nVillanueva against Rolan \n\n\nVillanueva and a turn-around jumper, he probably got fouled \n\n<$B> \n\nRolan <unclear> words </unclear> to that level \n\n\nHe needs to double team early for Rico to give up that ball and not make Rico just to make his curl over Rolan who looks like a rotonda to me against Rico Villanueva\n\n<$A> \n\nWell he touched the arm of Villanueva and the referee didn't uh he just let that go\n\n\nAnd you know Villanueva we 're gonna be watching his free throws \n\n\nHe was one of the players strongest from the free throw line during that game against F E U\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's Mark Abadia or rather Tagupa \n\n\nHe has an advantage over Requito I think that 's a mismatch going out of the way \n\n\nThe rest would have to be really Ateneo advantage in this game \n\n\nLet 's take a look at the numbers of Rico \n\n<$A> \n Again he splits his free throws \n\n\nOne for two for Enrico Villanueva, \n\n\nTagupa against Quimpo \n\n\nA left-handed drive \n\n\nInside to Abadia \n\n\nNice move by Abadia great pass and great recognition from Tagupa \n\n \n\nThat 's really the one two punch for Adamson\n\n They really recognize each other 's threats\n\n<$A> \n\nOh  it 's Quimpo saying payback time as he goes by Tagupa draws the foul \n\n They have another opportunity for a three-point play \n\n\nHere 's that nice, play to Abadia High Endurance sure shot brought to you by the High Endurance Old Spice\n\n\nMark Abadia, \n\n<$B> \n for Quimpo I think the minute has given him the confidence with two points a rebound and he 's still active in the ballgame he welcome he Tenorio starts for the game and I think they have forgotten about Baguio for long time now for Ateneo \n\n<$A> \n Well Danny wasn't able to play against F E U because he had a prior family commitment his sister got married \n\n\nHere 's a steal by Ateneo \n\n\nHere 's Sison \n\n\nSison throws to Villanueva but nice anticipation by Mangulabnan gives it to Tagupa \n\n\nAdamson down by one \n\n\nWith the ball Abadia against Membrere \n\n\nAbadia makes his move out to Tagupa \n\n\nFifteen on the shot clock, Tagupa gets a screen from Rolan \n\n\nTagupa <unclear> words </unclear> to Quimpo \n\n\nTagupa from the baseline hammers it in\n\n<$B> \n That 's what they 're doing right now\n\n with Tagupa scoring \n\n<$A> \n\nAteneo takes a quick thirty-second time-out \n\n\nWith Ateneo down by three, seven to four is our score  \n\n\nHere in the U A A P the thirty-second time-out in the first half is allowed and not only the coach can call it but the players the players as well \n\n<$B> \n\nRico obviously very unhappy with the way Tagupa 's burning <unclear> word </unclear> and no help coming his way \n\n<$A> \n\nHere 's our Smart Zed steal by Mangulabnan \n\n\nThe power to live the life you choose \n\n\nSmart Zed your cell phone now\n\n<$B> \n

shot Abadia with the rebound, \n\n\nAbadia walks it up for Adamson they 're up by three \n\n\nTagupa, throw it away \n\n\nNope \n\n\nBounced back by Rolan, \n\n\nOne  the  Rolan against Villanueva \n\n\nThat 's uh that 's a tough match-up Randy \n\n<$B> \n\nWell I really don'T know if it 's really that wise to give uh Rolan that opportunity to go against Villanueva \n\n Probably the idea is to just get Rico into early foul troubles and then you know that can take a breather by taking the defense right in the face from Rico \n\n<$A> \n\nAlvarez he 'll be called for the offensive foul\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd Alvarez is not involved in the offense of Ateneo I mean the first foul on Alvarez \n\n<$A> \n It 's the first time for him to get that leather and that pass to Mangulabnan\n\n\nAlvarez last

{"text": "<$A> \n\nIt 's Saturday afternoon a gorgeous afternoon for basketball\n\n\nWelcome to the U double A P second game today between two bitter\nrivals De La Salle University Green Archers and the University of Santo Tomas\nGrowling Tigers\n\n\nThat 's your second game today and of course today Cyrus Baguio\ncomes back against La Salle\n\n\nThe last time Cyrus met the Green Archers was way back in nineteen\nninety-nine and of course we all know that he missed all of last year\n\n\nSince nineteen ninety-nine the Tigers didn't win over the Green\nArchers\n\n\nCyrus Baguio and the Growling Tigers will meet the Green Archers\nthis afternoon live from the Rizal Memorial Coliseum\n\n\nI 'm Mico Halili with of course Mr Randy Sacdalan to bring you today 's\nbig game\n\n<$B> \n\nWell good afternoon to you Mico and uh you know La Salle and U\nS T whenever they play it is always a rivalry partner and tonight today we 're\ngonna see that rivalry again here at the Rizal\n\n\nIt 's overflowing here at the Rizal Memorial and boy it 's so\ndifficult to get a parking it 's so difficult to get inside the Rizal\nMemorial\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat is not difficult is to find out if these two teams are\nconsidered the top teams going into this tournament\n\n\nAs we look at the team standings of course La Salle with an\nimmaculate three zero slate tied up with arch rival Ateneo and then U S T not\nfar behind with two wins and just one loss\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yeah U S T wants to tie up uh La Salle at three and one\nafter this ballgame and wants just to keep Ateneo on top with a three and\nzero rating but the way U S T is playing you know it 's very difficult really\nto take U S T\n\n\nThis is a different U S T team Mico that we 're watching this year\ncompared to last year\n\n\nCertainly they have an inside track to get to the top\n\n\nThey almost did it against Ateneo uh but against La Salle I think\nthey will try again and see and continue and break away the pattern of a win\nthen they lose and then they win and hopefully today they 'll try to avert a\nloss against La Salle\n\n<$A> \n\nSo they 're Tigers are trying to go for a winning streak there\nbut that will be hard against this balanced La Salle offensive attack\n\n\nNow many people felt that going into this year La Salle would be a\nMike Cortez team but that 's not the case\n\n\nYou have to guard people like Mac-Mac Cardona Joseph Yeo and Adonis\nSanta Maria if you wish to stop the Green Archers\n\n<$B> \n\nBut partner easily the fifty-five points for uh De La Salle\nCardona Yeo Santa Maria and Cortez it 's so easy for them to score but you\nknow that this plan of attack just makes it difficult really for the  uh other opponents to play against a team that is so explosive inside\nout in\n\n\nWell for Santa Maria and Yeo this is really a surprise to Cardona\nhe 's leading the pack for De La Salle\n\n<$A> \n\nOf course so that 's La Salle 's balanced attack\n\n\nNow for the Growling Tigers what uh their fans are very happy about\nis the return of the dunking duo as you look at the cool cat Mike Cortez\nthere 's Joseph Yeo\n\n\nUh Green Archers really leaning on the scoring production of uh\nthese uh players\n\n<$B> \n\nOh yes and uh you know if it 's not for the shot of Yeo a lot\nof people say La Salle could 've been over in that game against N U\n\n\nBut in the case of the U S T Growling Tigers if you go by numbers\nMico they have five as compared to the four of La Salle\n\n\nI think U S T at this end would have the advantage but look\nEspiritu one of reasons for Espiritu and for Baguio I 've never seen him with\nthe fire in the eyes of Cyrus Baguio\n\n\nGelig Hubalde and Loanzon would just complement how U S T is so\npotent this year and so far that potential has turned out to be a reality for\nCoach Aric del Rosario\n\n<$A> \n\nSo keep in mind uh everyone uh U S T the last seven meetings\nthey 've had against the Green Archers they haven't won\n\n\nSo total combination for the Green Archers uh since nineteen\nninety-nine and the dunking duo Alwin Espiritu of the Growling Tigers they\nare eager to get back at the Green Archers this year\n\n\nWe 'll bring you La Salle versus U S T after this very short break\n\n \n\n\nUh U S T Growling Tigers coming into this game with two wins and\none loss\n\n\nThey defeated Adamson on the  uh on the opening weekend\nthen lost to Ateneo and then blasted U P just days ago\n\n\nAnd of course the U S T fans coming into this game full force\nbecause they know this they have a very very good chance of finally beating\nLa Salle after seven straight losses as we look at the starting line-ups\n\n<$B> \n\nWell they 're trying to break the spell this afternoon Mico\nand for  for any  La Salle U S T game it 's an event\nboth in along Taft Avenue and along Espa&ntilde;a and they brought the\nchallenge here along Vito Cruz\n\n\nYou know this is the probably the best probably for for U S T to\nhack out a win over La Salle\n\n\nLa Salle after uh three games has been exposed in that game against\nN U and for U S T they know they have a chance against La Salle today\n\n<$A> \n\nGreen Archers coming into this game with a perfect three wins\nand zero loss record\n\n\nNico Vainio can't pick up the loose ball and it 's with Iago\nRaterta\n\n\nSo here 's the U S T starting line-up Gelig Manansala Raterta\nEspiritu and Baguio\n\n\nA goal quickly to the big man against Manny Ramos who and is tapped\nalmost stolen by Vainio loose ball picked up by Gelig\n\n\nFive on the shot clock\n\n\nGelig fires and it 's no good rebound goes to Cortez\n\n\nIt 's Cortez Cardona Santa Maria Vainio Ramos standard issue\nstarting five for coach Franz Pumaren\n\n\nManny Ramos top of the key looking at Santa Maria there 's a long\npass and he cannot be stopped for that easy two\n\n<$B> \n\nThe two big men passing around U S T employing the zone Santa\nMaria getting that uh ball and the two points for La Salle  \n\n<$A> \n\nWell so far this season Cortez is fifty percent from the line\n\n\nHe was last year 's uh recipient of the sportsmanship award\n\n\nMisses two free throws but the offensive rebound goes to the\nArchers, \n\n\nNow here 's Cardona zigzagging through but gets lost\n\n<$B> \n\nThat is a match-up to watch Mico\n\n\nCyrus Baguio blocking Mac-Mac Cardona this early\n\n\nThey 're paying attention to the leading scorer of De La Salle\n\n<$A> \n\nCheck out this Rexona solid defense play brought to you by the\ntwenty-four hour Rexona your best defense against odor and wetness\n\n\nRexona it won't let you down\n\n\nThere are two players down on the floor and it 's an offensive foul\nagainst Nico Vainio\n\n<$B> \n\nWell he saw the opening go to the basket but the defense was\nsteady against him\n\n\nFirst foul on Nico Vainio ten all is the count\n\n\nWe can really feel the sixteen drums of U S T behind us Mico\n\n<$A> \n\n Well you know you talk about La Salle and U S\nT you 're basically talking about the two most dominant teams in the last ten\nyears\n\n\nIn the last ten seasons U S T had four championships La Salle four\nchampionships and then F E U with the two championships in ninety-seven and\nninety-two\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd you know what U S T doesn't want to happen is for La Salle\nto break that four-peat for the four straight championships for U S T\n\n\nLa Salle is attempting its fifth straight and that would eclipse\nthe record of U S T\n\n<$A> \n\nOf course U E with a win earlier of course they 're smiling\nsaying well try to beat our seven-peat back in the seventies  \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay let 's take this time-out\n\n\nThe ballgame is tied at ten all between the Archers and the Tigers\n\n\nWe have a time-out we 'll be back after this short break  \n\n<$B> \n\nWait a minute who 's in and who 's out so Raterte sits down\nnot Baguio Baguio thought he 's the one who 's who 's gonna be seated but he 's\nmaintained on the floor for U S T\n\n<$A> \n\nWith a score at twenty-one sixteen five-point lead for U S T\nand Tang loses the ball against Edsel del Rosario\n\n<$B> \n\nIt 's always a challenge for La Salle when Mike Cortez sits\ndown T Y Tang comes in he needs to be warmed-up to take control of that\nleather\n\n<$A> \n\nDe Guzman, was part of the all-rookie team last year\n\n\nHere 's Gelig from the right side\n\n\nThey go to Espiritu at the post the pull-up is no good\n\n\nSharma with the rebound, Archers down by five and the Xavier\nboys are in the back court Tang and Yeo, \n\n\nTang on the right side over to Sharma from seven feet\n\n<$B> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear> with that important shot from\nSharma for De La Salle\n\n<$A> \n\nSharma now with four points in the game\n\n\nA three-point lead for the Tigers\n\n\nTime is running out in the first quarter\n\n\nGelig shaking and baking and pulling\n\n\nTen points in the first quarter for Ni&ntilde;o Gelig\n\n<$B> \n\nSo it 's as if he has already hit his total for the game and\nNi&ntilde;o still has so much to give for U S T\n\n<$A> \n\nTang to Sharma on the right side again to Gelig Sharma goes to\nYeo\n\n\nNine on the shot clock\n\n\nYeo couldn't pass air ball goes to Cabatu the rebound but he lost\nthe ball picked up by <unclear> words </unclear> there 's the rebound  \n\n\nTigers up by five Gelig he slightly overshoots two seconds to go\n\n\nTang needs to hurry up and he needs to launch it  \nbut he wasn't aware of the time\n\n\nSo that 's how we 'll end the first quarter of the play\n\n\nThe Growling Tigers are certainly roaring Ni&ntilde;o Gelig with\nten big points to lead the Tigers and give them a five-point lead\ntwenty-three eighteen\n\n\nWe 'll be back with the second quarter in just a while  \n\n\nThe former

ceremonies for this uh fifty-fifth edition of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines\n\n<$A> \n\n Right   \n\n\nI know Jimmy\n\n\nAnd you know it was so exciting during the parade of

of the first ball by uh Quezon City Mel Mathay by the way\n\n\nWe 'd like to tell you that U S T out of all I think has to be favored uh Jimmy\n\n\nThey 've got an intact line-up from last year and a lot of their players were playing in the Philippine Amateur Basketball League\n\n\nSo a lot of experience there\n\n\nAnd then you 've got that triple tower threat\n\n\nThat 's uh Adamson they 've got Feihl standing seven feet\n\n\nThey 've got uh     \n\n<$B> \n\n Marlou   Aquino\n\n<$A> \n\nMarlou Aquino six nine Pineda six six\n\n\nThen of course you 've got the most dominant basketball player in the league right now Zandro Limpot for La Salle\n\n\nYou 've got uh the peppery Johnny Abarrientos from uh F E U\n\n\nThere 's no more problem but Johnny Abarrientos is there and this all is a force to reckon he can make things happen\n\n\nAnd then your  alma mater  Ateneo\n\n\nOkay it 's a fighting squad\n\n\nI talked to Chot Reyes\n\n\nWell maybe they might pull some surprises just like U P\n\n\nAnd a first again in the U A A P we have and I think in uh amateur basketball sport will be the first lady manager and that 's Tess Jasmines of U P\n\n\nShe 's gonna sit in on the bench of U P Jim\n\n\nAnd just to round up things we 've got U E a new coach\n\n\nThat 's uh Johnny Revilla and then also N U the favorite whipping boys but don't bet your money uh your life on it this time uh Jim\n\n<$B> \n\n  Here 's the game  or two to win <unclear> words </unclear> this year\n\n<$A> \n\n I know   \n\n\nAs they did last year they won one game\n\n\nSo maybe this year they 'll win by three or four and uh okay we 'll we 'll go to studios first Jim and then we 'll come back for the ceremonial uh toss of uh by Mayor Mel Mathay\n\n<$B> \n\nYes uh the U double A P has uh chosen Quezon City as its venue for most of the ballgames the basketball games\n\n\nIt 's just fitting that uh new newly-elected Mayor uh Mel Mathay will be doing the ceremonial toss right here in Araneta Coliseum\n\n<$A> \n\nRight newly-elected Mayor\n\n\nSo uh uh, that 's uh they 're introducing the players right now from both teams that 's uh U P and U S T but soon we will be uh having that ceremonial toss  \n\n\nEmcee now in today 's proceedings is uh Web de los Reyes Sports Radio  \n\n\nHey how do you feel\n\n\nHow does it feel to be here\n\n<$B> \n\nIt appears <unclear> words </unclear> but it 's fun Joaqui because uh it 's the first time I 've been to a U double A P game since college and that 's like uh\n\n<$A> \n\nWow that 's twenty years ago\n\n<$B> \n\nLet 's not let 's not say how many years ago\n\n\nThat 's\n\n<$A> \n\nTwenty years ago it seems that 's a long time\n\n<$B> \n\nVery jam-packed Araneta Coliseum Joaqui\n\n\nI was surprised to see all these   people  supporting their teams\n\n<$A> \n\n Yeah   \n\n\nAnd you 'll be surprised every game it 's like that\n\n\nThe students the fans they all come out and support the teams\n\n\nYou know there 's nothing like uh college ball okay  the universities and all all schools right now are very competitive and that 's the reason why I think we have a very good turn-out Jim\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd we can barely see that the uh alumni of La Salle have uh come in great numbers with uh  eighty seventy-seven we keep score  \n\n\nThey have  the glory years  and of course well we 'll be talking more about uh a little controversy that occurred last year but as we talked to the concerned parties a little earlier it 's past them now\n\n\nIt 's a new uh it 's a new school year and it 's a new ball game for those two teams that went to that championship last year\n\n<$A> \n\nYes <unclear> words </unclear> Jim I think Adamson and U S T will be in the thick of the fight\n\n\nI really believe so\n\n\nAdamson they 've got height and U S T a lot of experience there\n\n\nYeah you 're saying you 're pointing out those streamers at the La Salle section  eighty to seventy-seven we keep score  and then  the glory years nineteen eighty-nine nineteen ninety nineteen ninety-one  \n\n\nOkay let 's let 's turn you over now uh to Web de los Reyes and uh we will have that ceremonial toss now\n\n\nBut they 're they 're introducing members of both squads but that 's taking some time now  \n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh very familiar faces in uh the U S T team we see Dennis Espino there is Udoy Belmonte\n\n<$A> \n\nRight you should know because they played in the League\n\n\nYou you covered some of those games  \n\n\nWe 're here now with uh the Mayor of Quezon City of course newly-elected Mayor Mel Mathay\n\n\nCongratulations uh Mayor\n\n<$C> \n\nThank you Joaqui and uh\n\n<$A> \n\nJimmy\n\n<$C> \n\nJimmy\n\n<$A> \n\nYes now that you 're the new mayor uh the new mayor of Quezon City what uh programs do you have to develop sports in uh Quezon City, Mayor\n\n<$C> \n\nWell uh definitely it was one of the highest priority in uh the city 's program\n\n\nIn fact uh when I uh address the City Council for the State of the City it would be one of the programs that will be part of the address\n\n\nWe 're trying to uh consolidate and recover uh the uh Amoranto Stadium precisely so we could utilize this in a more uh vigorous and aggressive sports program\n\n\nYou know in the public schools alone in Quezon City elementary and high school we have a population of quarter of a million two hundred   fifty  million  student population\n\n<$A> \n\n Wow   \n\n<$C> \n\nAnd considering that uh one of our uh principal uh concern is the drug problem you know sports will have to play our key role  ,  in uh addressing this problem of uh drug addiction\n\n<$A> \n\n Key role   yeah\n\n\nI share that view really that drug addiction problem I mean through sports I think I think you 'll be able to do that\n\n<$C> \n\nThat 's the reason why uh the theme of the U A A P this year I think is very appropriate meaning uh character  exerted  the character promotes sport and help the nation and of course help the host city Quezon City\n\n<$A> \n\nHey we 'll be playing a lot of almost all our games in Quezon City Loyola Center and uh Araneta\n\n\nI think a few games some other place but most of the games will be held in Quezon City\n\n<$C> \n\nYes that 's what I was told uh by the President of U A A P and I assured him that I have given orders to the Central Police District that uh to guarantee and ensure that these two venues would be uh safe not only for the those who would be attending the games but uh to see to it that uh there will be no carnapping\n\n<$A> \n\n Okay that 's really nice to hear from the Mayor\n\n\nHey that 's really very nice\n\n\nNow tell me is there a favorite team you 're rooting for or no\n\n<$C> \n\nWell not really\n\n\nI uh come of course from the uh State University\n\n<$A> \n\nI know\n\n<$C> \n\nBut uh you know uh this is one area where we would really like uh all the teams to do their best\n\n\nAfter all uh it has been a truism that it is not in winning but it 's how you play the game\n\n<$A> \n\nHow you play the game\n\n\nVery true and besides the Mayor couldn't say \" for U P \" because there 's an Atenean there and a La Sallite here so  \n\n\nSo Mayor is there any parting words you 'd like to\n\n\nUh Jimmy would you like to ask uh anything\n\n<$B> \n\nWell uh it 's a little political but I 'm sure it was a very gratifying win for uh former Congressman now Mayor-elect of Quezon City uh Mel Mathay\n\n\nAnd uh I 'm sure uh there will be a wealth of experience from the Metro Manila Authority and uh his stint as congressman as he goes into his new position of mayor of Quezon City\n\n<$C> \n\nThank you uh Jimmy\n\n\nYou know it has been a twenty-five year quest having been elected vice-mayor of the city twenty-five years ago having served Metro Manila as vice-governor and also elected to the  Batasang Pambansa  and uh before elected to the mayorship as uh member of the uh Congress of the Republic\n\n\nSo I think uh hopefully with everybody supporting us we will be able to approximate and reach the vision of uh the late President Quezon of what Quezon City ought to be\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd on that hopeful note we thank uh Mayor Mel Mathay for gracing the occasion and I 'm sure you 'll be here with us in the coming games to watch   the rest  of the of the U double A P season\n\n<$C> \n\n Of course   \n\n<$A> \n\nCongratulations\n\n<$C> \n\nWe 'll see we 'll see you around\n\n<$A> \n\nThank you\n\n\nOkay let 's go over to the studios now Jim\n\n\nWe 've got some very important reminders  \n\n<$B> \n\nOkay

{"text": "<$A> \n\nHello everybody this is Freddie Abando coming to you from the Sydney International Aquatic Center here in Sydney for day two of swimming\n\n\nTonight we 're going to have the four final events and uh several semi-final events and we will be starting out today 's tonight 's program with the semi-finals in the one-hundred meter back stroke for women\n\n\nAnd uh definitely it 's gonna be a very interesting race to see whether the United States can win gold and uh Japan also hoping to strike gold\n\n\nNow after day one it 's Australia leading in the battle count uh with two golds courtesy of Ian Thorpe the torpedo winning the four-hundred meter gold yesterday and uh anchoring the four by one-hundred meter relay team in upsetting the United States\n\n\nOn lane number two is Diana Kalup sounds very much like a Filipina\n\n\nLouise Ornstedt of Denmark in uh lane number three with a qualifying time of one minute one point ninety-eight\n\n\nLane four Diana Moshanu of uh Romania one minute one eighteen seconds and then you have uh Bedford B J Bedford of the United States on lane number five\n\n\nLane six Sue Zhan of China with a qualifying time of one minute two point nineteen seconds this morning\n\n\nIn lane seven Kelly  Shivanshef of Canada with a qualifying time of one minute two point seventy-eight seconds and of course on lane eight is Kirsty Coventry with a qualifying time of one minute three point five seconds\n\n\nThe world record holder in this event is Hesi Hon of China with a record of one minute point sixteen seconds set in Rome in nineteen ninety-four\n\n\nAnd Kristin Nagersaki of Hungary retired now setting the Olympic record of one minute sixty-eight in Barcelona on July twenty-eight nineteen ninety-two\n\n\nTwo lengths of the pool for the first semi-final heat in the one-hundred meter backstroke and Moshanu on lane number four for Romania swimming the fastest time among the fastest time this morning and getting off very well first fifty-meter mark Moshanu and Bedford of the United States first twenty-five meters and we have also the swimmer on lane and number five\n\n\nLane number five is Bedford of the United States Zhan Zhu of China on lane six first fifty who will touch first and we have the swimmer on lane number two Diana Kalup of Australia looking very strong as we go for the final forty and Kalup of Australia touching first at the fifty with the swimmer on lane number four that 's Moshanu in in first place right now\n\n\nSecond is Kalup of Australia third Bedford of the United States\n\n\nLast twenty meters and Moshanu on lane number four Kalup who took the first fifty has fallen and touching first is, Diana Moshanu of Romania with a time of one minute seventy seconds and Bedford of the United States in second place one minute one point sixty-one Ornstedt, of uh Denmark the time of one minute one point sixty-nine and in fourth place Diana Kalup the early leader in the first fifty of the one-hundred meter backstroke\n\n\nSo it 's Moshanu with the time of one minute zero zero point seventy improving on her qualifying time this morning of one minute one point eighteen seconds topping heat one of the semi-finals in the one-hundred meter backstroke  \n\n\nOne-hundred meter backstroke and the fastest qualifying time has been registered by an Asian with the Japanese hoping to score medals \n\n\nYesterday they did in the four-hundred meter individual medley in the person of Tajima finishing behind Glocola of uh Ukraine and the fastest qualifier in the backstroke is a Japanese Mai Nakamura, \n\n Lane one Sandra Vulker of uh Germany with the time of one minute two point eighty-eight seconds another German is on lane two Anne Vuschiov with the time of one minute two point twenty-three seconds Ni&ntilde;a Zhivanevskaya of Spain on lane number three with a qualifying time of one minute one point ninety-seven seconds Japan 's Mai Nakamura fastest qualifying time of one minute zero zero point eighty-eight seconds that 's from Japan\n\n\nAnd lane number five Roxanna Marashinu of France with a qualifying time of one minute one point sixty-six seconds\n\n\nAnother Japanese on lane number six Noriko Inada Jacky Saxon of Great Britain on lane number seven Lido Kwang of China in lane eight\n\n\nSo here we are for the final semi-final heat of the evening in the one-hundred meter backstroke\n\n\nThe world record holder in this event is China 's Hesi Hon set in Rome in nineteen ninety-four and the Olympic record set in Barcelona nineteen ninety-two\n\n\nThe Japanese are making a very strong comeback in world swimming and they are doing it here in the Olympic games here in Sydney\n\n\nSo swimmer to watch is on lane four Mai Nakamura with a qualifying time of one minute point eighty-eight seconds two lengths of the pool and whoever registers the fastest qualifying timing uh time top eight after the semi-finals will make it to the finals of this event\n\n\nSo far Australia leading the medal haul uh for the gold with Ian Thorpe the torpedo winning two golds\n\n\nGreat start by Nakamura of Japan on lane number four and uh well he  was uh the one who came out last surface out of the water and she 's leading right now lane three also for, Spain Ni&ntilde;a and as we can see them as they hit the first fifty we have Nakamura of Japan leading and registers the time of twenty-nine point thirty-six twenty-nine point seventy-four for Ni&ntilde;a for Spain and as we hit the final forty meters Nakamura of Japan still swimming very strong \n\n Swimmer also on lane number six Inada Noriko of Japan coming back very strong in the home stretch of this race \n\n Swimmer on lane three Ni&ntilde;a of Spain Nakamura fading\n\n\nInada Noriko of Japan is coming back very strong on lane six and the winner is on lane number one uh lane number four Mai Nakamura with the time of one minute one point zero seven seconds and another Japanese one minute one point twenty-five Inada and in third place is Ni&ntilde;a Zhivanevska of Spain with the time of one minute one point forty-one seconds\n\n\nSo the Japanese are expected to be favorites in the finals for the one-hundred meter backstroke with two of them making it to the finals with very fast times Nakamura and Inada but the fastest time registered by Diana Moshanu or Moshanu of Romania\n\n\nSecond is Nakamura of uh Japan together with Inada uh Ni&ntilde;a of Spain and number five is Bedford of the United States \n\n \n\n\nWe 're back here at the uh Sydney International Aquatic Center as we bring you our continuing coverage of swimming on day two and now we go to the two-hundred meter freestyle first semi-final event\n\n\nIt 's gonna be very interesting to see again Ian Thorpe who 'll be swimming in heat number two of the semi-finals \n\n The world record holder in this event is Ian Thorpe with the time of uh, one minute eighteen point eighteen seconds that 's a very fast time I think and uh he holds also the Olympic record set this morning with the time of one minute nineteen point eighty-two seconds here at the Aquatic Center \n\n And the entries for semi-final heat one Stephan Paul on lane one Onison on lane number two from Israel Hoogenband is on lane number four lane five is Josh Davis of the United States Kat Goldblat on lane six with a qualifying time of one minute forty-nine point zero five seconds\n\n\nStephan Verst of Germany with a qualifying time of one minute forty-nine point eighty-four seconds and uh Il Batila Zubur with the qualifying time of one minute fifty point eleven seconds for to complete the cast of the first eight in semi-final heat number one\n\n\nThe World and Olympic record is held by no less than Ian Thorpe and is known as the torpedo torpedo so far  two gold medals uh for Australia yesterday anchoring the four by one-hundred meter relay and beating the United States in this particular event\n\n\nSo two golds one individual and one team for Ian Thorpe, \n\n\nRemember this is four lengths of the pool\n\n\nThe world record is one minute forty-five point fifty-one seconds\n\n\nThere should be a correction of what we have seen earlier here a split, and we see that the swimmer on lane four lane four is Hoogenband of the Netherlands together with Josh Davis and it 's the  Hoogenband with twenty-four point fifty-one at the first fifty-meter mark \n\n And uh we see that Josh Davis of the United States is trailing in third place James Salter of Great Britain as we hit the first one hundred first two lengths of this pool and uh it 's Hoogenband of uh the Netherlands with the time of fifty-one point twelve seconds Josh Davis fifty-one fifty-four James Salter of Great Britain in third place Van den Hoogenband starting to spread the field while Josh Davis is just trailing just half a body length as we hit the one-hundred fifty meter mark of the two-hundred meter freestyle\n\n\nThe world record just a correction for what we mentioned earlier is one minute forty-five point fifty-one, uh what we mentioned earlier was the first hundred uh uh fifty and we are approaching the homestretch of this race and Hoogenband of the Netherlands no doubt is going to win this very easily over Josh Davis of the United States and the battle for third is either on lane number three and lane number five but Hoogenband of the Netherlands winning with the time of one minute forty-five point thirty-five seconds and Josh Davis of the U S with the time of one minute forty-seven point o six seconds very slow record and that is a world record\n\n\nI think that 's a world record for you yes a world record by Hoogenband breaking the record of uh Ian Thorpe with a with a swim of one minute forty-five point thirty-five and breaking the record the world record and the Olympic record set by Ian Thorpe this morning\n\n\nSo Pieter van de Hoogenband winning the first heat of the semi-finals with a time of one minute forty-five point thirty-five\n\n\nThere 's the dive and Josh Davis of the United States one forty-seven point zero six\n\n\nIt 's gonna be very interesting to see how the race will develop later on between Ian Thorpe and Hoogenband of the Netherlands\n\n\nAnd we 'll be back with semi-final heat number two in the two-hundred meter freestyle featuring Ian Thorpe of Australia winner already of two gold medals \n\n \n\n\nHere at the Sydney International Aquatic Center and the Aussies are cheering for their hero in these Games\n\n\nIan Thorpe whose world record has just been broken by Pieter Van de Hoogenband of the Netherlands in the heat number one of the two-hundred meters freestyle\n\n\nWell this morning he broke the Olympic records so the record now belongs to Hoogenband with the time of one minute forty-five point thirty-five seconds and done in semi-final heat number one\n\n\nBrad Hackett, of Australia swimming in lane number two with a qualifying time of one minute forty-nine point twenty-three seconds Rick Say of Canada lane three qualifying time is one minute forty-eight point sixty-two\n\n\nThere 's the event the man of the hour here in these Olympic Games\n\n\nIan Thorpe qualifying time is one minute forty-six point fifty-six\n\n\nThis morning that was an Olympic record but just broken by Hoogenband of the Netherlands \n\n On lane, five is Rossellino lane six is Igor Coledo of Belarus lane seven Great Britain 's Bob Palmer and uh Hungary 's Del Lazapatas with a qualifying time of one minute fifty point ten seconds in lane eight\n\n\nThe man to watch lane four of Australia Ian Thorpe broke the Olympic record this morning but that record has been broken just earlier by Hoogenband in the first heat of the semi-finals qualifying and Brad Hackett of Australia also seeded to be in the finals on lane number two and Canada 's Rick Say on lane three\n\n\nGood start by Ian Thorpe very quick now leading the pack as we go for the first one hundred meters and Rick Say of Canada looking very strong also on lane four but Ian Thorpe is leading comfortably not yet and Rick Say is in lane number three and first to hit the wall is Ian Thorpe twenty-four point ninety-five twenty-five point ten by Rick Say of Canada and Ian Thorpe just taking a very easy swim he might be on world record pace after the first one hundred\n\n\nAnd we can see that Ian Thorpe just taking it very easy as we go for the final ten meters and just spreading his, uh strokes and first one hundred and here is Ian Thorpe with the time, on his side uh right now uh hoping to break the record done by Hoogenband earlier swimming strong as we hit the one-hundred fifty meter mark and this is the final fifty coming uptime of one minute eighteen point sixty-seven that 's world record pace for you Ian Thorpe final forty and a crowd here at the Aquatic Center egging on Ian Thorpe of Canada\n\n\nRick Say is uh very much behind Rossellino of Italy swimming very strongly but Ian Thorpe very comfortable he might just go for a world record time is one, minute forty-five point thirty-seven just two hundredth of a second and well it 's still a world record of Hoogenband with one minute forty-five point thirty-five earlier \n\n And Ian Thorpe just registering one minute forty-five point thirty-seven to win heat number two and Rossellino of Italy with the time of one minute forty-six point sixty\n\n\nThere is Ian Thorpe jumping to the pool, very relaxed swim actually in the first one hundred and it was only in the last fifty that he he increased his pace and there is Ian Thorpe holder of two world records already here in these Games but falling short in breaking the record set by Hoogenband of the Netherlands just earlier in semi-final heat number one\n\n\nIt 's gonna be a very interesting race in the finals later on it 's going to be a one-on-one between Hoogenband the world record holder the new one and Ian Thorpe Australia 's golden boy in these Games", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b798d268-7817-4f4f-a678-77f07d9755b8", "added":

center court of the Philippine Columbian Association here in Plaza Dilao in uh Paco Manila\n\n\nAnd uh we 're going to bring you the finals in both the men 's and women 's events of the tenth or the nineteen ninety-one edition of the P C A Open the most prestigious uh tournament in the country \n\n Mia\n\n<$A> \n\nRon this is going to be a very exciting match because these women 's finals are going to be uh very very uh memorable because this is between the two top players of the country\n\n\nNumber one is Jennifer Sared who is a veteran Asian campaigner and always a team member of the Asian team while the other side is Joanna Feria the number two\n\n\nShe is the lone Filipina to reach past the second round of the Wimbledon Juniors\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's right and of course both players are fresh from their trip to Wimbledon where uh as you mentioned Joanna Feria uh won in her first assignment but uh lost in the second\n\n\nOf course uh Jennifer Sared is also a veteran internationalist having won some of the uh Junior titles in Southeast Asia\n\n\nAnd of course uh later on after this uh match we are going to bring you the men 's championship between Jun Allerre and of course Robert uh Bobby Angelo two new faces in the P C A uh finals list\n\n<$A> \n\nJun Allerre has been the national coach of the men 's and the women 's junior team since nineteen ninety\n\n\nSo it 's going to be exciting because Bobby Angelo just came from the States where he learned new strokes and now he is more powerful\n\n\nBy the way the tenth P C A Open Tennis Championship is being brought to you by San Miguel Beer Super Dry Milo Stronghold Insurance Company Grant Sportswear Only Store Easy Call Copacabana Hotel The A G Q Construction Integrated Sales and of course Nike\n\n\nLet 's go to the men 's doubles\n\n\nThe men 's doubles will pit Danilo Pila and Camoy Palaha against Jun Allerre and Bobby Angelo are  our finalists for the men 's finals\n\n\nSo that 's going to be pretty exciting\n\n\nThat comes after the men 's finals between Bobby Angelo and Jhun Allerre\n\n<$B> \n\nUh well what do you think uh of this uh match Mia\n\n<$A> \n\nJennifer Sared has more experience more exposure in the local and international scene\n\n\nBut Joanna Feria has been moving very well\n\n\nHer, forehand has been consistent and so is her backhand\n\n\nSo you really can't tell although Jennifer Sared has the upper hand\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's right\n\n\nUh before going into the finals of course Jennifer Sared adventured to beat Francesca La'O in the Philippine International Junior Tennis Championships uh held last April where she lost to uh uh Francesca La'O in uh in the finals\n\n<$A> \n\nJoanna  Feria made it to the finals by beating Bao Kim in the semi-finals in the exciting three setter\n\n\nShe really showed her persistence and patience in that match Ron\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's right, \n\n\nWell not everybody knows that uh the girl on the other side Joanna Feria also competed in track and field before really concentrating in uh the game of tennis\n\n\nAs I was talking earlier to her father uh Nonoy Feria and he said that uh well Joanna was part of the track and field team that went to Beijing in the nineteen ninety Asian Games\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's right\n\n\nToo bad she had to quit because she she had leg injury already\n\n\nBut then she chose tennis because she feels that she is going to do more in tennis than in track and field\n\n\nIt 's already love fifteen in favor of Joanna Feria with Jennifer Sared serving, \n\n<$B> \n\nOur drives by uh Jennifer Sared\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know Ron that looked like an unforced error\n\n\nBut if you just could see the power in the forehand of Jennifer Sared then the spin just was too much for Joanna Feria then\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's right\n\n\nUh fifteen all is the count\n\n\nThis is the first game of the first set, \n\n\nAnother error by Joanna Feria\n\n<$A> \n\nBoth players are still playing near the baseline\n\n\nMaybe trying to feel each other out\n\n<$B> \n\nRight, \n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's thirty fifteen in favor of Jennifer Sared, \n\n\nThere 's a fault, \n\n<$B> \n\nSecond big rally here, \n\n\nFirst time on the net\n\n\nIt 's out\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's too bad\n\n\nJoanna Feria had the chance to make a beautiful approach out and go for the winner but then she just sort of blundered\n\n\nIt 's forty fifteen in favor of Jennifer Sared, \n\n\nNice short  \n\n<$Z> \n \n\n<$A> \n\nJoanna Feria served with Feria leading with Feria down love one in the first set, \n\n\nOkay, \n\n\nAnother unforced error in the backhand by Joanna Feria\n\n\nYou know in the national level you can't afford to make too many of those, \n\n\nA double fault by Joanna Feria, \n\n\nMaybe she still has opening set jitters but she 'll go come over it she has to\n\n<$B> \n\nSo looking at the score board\n\n\nIt said Joanna Feria is leading\n\n\nI think our umpire there, yes uh it 's supposed to be thirty fifteen in favor of Jennifer, \n\n<$A> \n\nThe score is fifteen thirty with Joanna Feria serving, \n\n\nBeautiful rally here, \n\n\nThirty all Joanna Feria has come back from down love thirty to thirty all with her long baseline rallies\n\n<$B> \n\nI think she 's playing with uh more confidence now uh compared to the first game of the set\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's right, \n\n\nJennifer wasn't able to make the ball go over the net as her racket was just too high\n\n\nIt 's now forty thirty\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd Joanna Feria will now go for the game point and the chance here for Joanna to even the score at one all in the first set, \n\n<$A> \n\nOh bad choice of shot there by Joanna Feria\n\n\nShe was at the baseline and she opted for a drop shot\n\n<$B> \n\nMissed opportunity by Joanna to level the count at one all, \n\n<$A> \n\nJoanna Feria dictating the point here, \n\n<$B> \n\nPowerful backhand by Jennifer Sared forced uh Joanna Feria to commit that uh error\n\n\nLet 's take a look at the slow-mo brought to you by Milo the Olympic energy drink\n\n\nThere 's a\n\n<$A> \n\nA powerful backhand a <unclear> 1 word </unclear> shot by Jennifer Sared which cost Joanna Feria a point\n\n\nIt 's now advantage Sared, \n\n<$B> \n\nSecond serve, \n\n<$A> \n\nFirst we would like to thank the sponsors of the tenth P C A Open Tennis Championships Milo the Olympic energy drink Grant Stronghold Nike Copacabana A G Q Construction Integrated Sales Easy Call Sportswear Only Store Nodalos and  Pro-Technics , \n\n\nIt 's now deuce, \n\n\nSecond serve for Joanna Feria, \n\n\nLet 's not forget San Miguel Super Dry Beer, and\n\n<$B> \n\nYes the first double fault of uh Joanna Feria\n\n<$A> \n\nThat was a costly double fault\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd that fault uh Jennifer on the advantage needing only a point here to win the second game, \n\n<$A> \n\nBackhand to backhand rally, \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd the second game going to Jennifer Sared two love in the first set, \n\n<$A> \n\nI think the turning point there was the double fault by Joanna Feria\n\n\nIt gave Jennifer Sared the upper hand and the confidence to go more for the second serve\n\n\nLet 's look at the slow-mo of that brought to us by Milo the Olympic energy drink\n\n<$B> \n\nShe had at least uh two or three times or three chances to make the second game but lost it\n\n<$A> \n\nThat 's right, \n\n\nJust a little out by the backhand of Jennifer Sared\n\n\nSeems like this match is going to be punctuated by long rallies Ron\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's right and uh well both players are opting to go for the baseline\n\n\nAnd so we can expect that kind of play in this championship\n\n\nAnd so far, I think that was the first time Jennifer went uh to the net\n\n\nLet 's take a look at the slow-mo brought to you by Milo\n\n<$A> \n\nThere 's the short and the beautiful cross court by Jennifer Sared\n\n<$B> \n\nFifteen love uh fifteen all, <unclear> 3 words </unclear> \n\n\nFirst serve by Jennifer Sared, \n\n\nBackhand to backhand rally\n\n\nAgain Jennifer is forcing uh that error by that backhand error by Joanna Feria\n\n<$A> \n\nJoanna Feria 's doing the right thing\n\n\nShe 's making Jennifer Sared move\n\n\nBecause Jennifer can't stay at the baseline all day\n\n\nIt just gives the balls to her\n\n<$B> \n\nThirty fifteen, \n\n<$A> \n\nJust a little out by Jennifer Sared\n\n\nIt 's thirty all, \n\n<$A> \n\nForty thirty with Jennifer Sared leading\n\n\nThe first serves 've been coming in lately\n\n\nThat 's one of the advantages of being a little bit taller, \n\n\nBeautiful rally by both players\n\n\nBackhand to backhand again, \n\n\nJennifer Sared dictating the point now moving Joanna Feria, \n\n<$B> \n\nBeautiful backhand to Jennifer by Joanna Feria\n\n<$A> \n\nShe capitalized on that short ball by Jennifer Sared\n\n\nThere it is brought to you by Milo\n\n\nThere is that beautiful cross court which caused Jennifer Sared an error\n\n\nIt 's now deuce, \n\n\nBy the way we want to thank Milo the Olympic energy drink for supporting the tenth P C A Open Tennis Championships, \n\n\nAnother major supporter of the P C A Open is San Miguel Super Dry Beer the difference is dry, \n\n<$B> \n\nJennifer gains the upper hand, in this third game of the first set\n\n\nA very elusive point there uh Mia  ,  for both players\n\n<$A> \n\n That 's right   \n\n\nThat 's right\n\n\nIf Jennifer holds her serve she 's up three love, \n\n\nJennifer Sared again dictating the point, moving Joanna Feria to and fro\n\n<$B> \n\nSared wins this third game\n\n\nShe now leads three love\n\n\nAnd we will continue with the action after we pause for these important reminders  \n\n<$A> \n\nThe Open Tennis Championships brought to you by Super Dry San Miguel Super Dry the difference is dry Easy Call Stronghold Grant Sportswear Milo  Pro-Technics  and Nodalo 's exhaust system\n\n\nJennifer Sared is now up love three in the first set\n\n<$B> \n\nJoanna 's first serve a fault, \n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's fifteen love, \n\n<$B> \n\nOh another error by uh Jennifer Sared\n\n<$A> \n\nJoanna Feria has this big chance to hold serve and she has to\n\n\nShe 's down love three in the first set, and hasn't yet found her serve\n\n\nIt 's now thirty love,  \n\n<$B> \n\nBeautiful attack to the net by Joanna Feria\n\n<$A> \n\nLet 's see the slow-mo brought to you by Milo the Olympic energy drink\n\n\nThere is that beautiful cross court by Joanna Feria coming from a pure poorly executed drop shot by Jennifer Sared\n\n\nIt 's now forty love, \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd easy coming here in the fourth game by Joanna Feria\n\n\nIt 's now one three and Joanna trailing by two games in this set\n\n\nBy the way we would like to uh acknowledge the the work uh the tremendous work put in by the members of the tournament committee for the tenth uh Philippine Columbian Association Open\n\n\nOf course uh the chairman is Raul Diaz overall chairman Albert Que is the co-chairman\n\n\nOh beautiful drop shot there  by

{"text": "<$A> \n\nTons of brick have been taken off his chest they 'll be replaced by a medal of gold and the Philippines has broken its drought in tennis via the men 's singles finals wherein Barrientos disposed of a tough and hard-fighting rookie in the men 's circuit <unclear> name </unclear> of Indonesia six three seven six \n\n forcing a tie break in that second set a long drawn-out affair but nonetheless Felix Barrientos prevailed\n\n\nAnd now we take you to Green Valley Country Club were Butch Maniego and Lyn Sembrano will bring you the ladies Masters semi-finals in our first uh full day of coverage of bowling,   \n\n<$B> \n\n Country Club lanes in Pasig site of the bowling competition of the sixteenth SEA Games\n\n\nThis is the sixth and final day of bowling competition\n\n\nTen bowls have already been handed out and my name is Butch Maniego \n Working with me this afternoon is a bowler a national team bowler who only began playing two years ago but she 's gone a long way since then\n\n\nThis is Lyn Sembrano\n\n\nGood morning Lyn\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah good morning Butch\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh Lyn was a member of the national team for this main competitions but uh she was not able to compete I believe here in this tournament but uh she 's here to provide her expert analysis and opinion of what 's transpiring here in the women 's Masters\n\n\nThis is the fifteenth and final game\n\n\n<unclear> 2 words </unclear> will be bringing you flat to step ladder finals later on\n\n\nRight now Lyn how is the country doing as far as uh medals are concerned here in the bowling competition\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah uh regarding the medal standing\n\n\nSo far   uh  we have won uh the for the silver medal on the doubles event\n\n<$B> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd uh a silver for the silver for the men 's we also have won in the grand in the all events for the men we have captured all the medals the gold the silver and the bronze\n\n\nAnd right now we 're hopeful that we can get at least a gold medal here because we have Arianne Cerde&ntilde;a and Liza Fernandez in the top three positions and for the men as far as the men 's are concerned we have the one two three four of which we can hopefully get into the step ladder later this afternoon\n\n<$B> \n\nYes thank you very much Lyn\n\n\nSo far here in uh women 's Masters where the top sixteen players in the all-events qualified as uh Lyn mentioned Liza Fernandez occupying the number one spot after fourteen after fourteen games\n\n\nThis is the fifteenth and final game\n\n\nThey played a round robin type of a match play in which uh the bowlers go head-to-head and the winners will get an additional ten pin if they uh beat their opponent in their head-to-head match-up but still what counts is the total number of pins garnered by the players after fifteen games\n\n\n  Right Lyn  \n\n<$C> \n\n Yes uh uh   Liza is leading way way ahead and the number two is so far Grace Young of Singapore and uh close behind down by just forty-one pins is Arianne Cerde&ntilde;a our Olympic gold medalist\n\n\nSo Arianne always has a final kick and we hope that she gets into that number two slot\n\n\nAnyway uh what whoever is the number two or three gets a crack beating Liza Fernandez who 's our top qualifier bowling the last game\n\n<$B> \n\nYes Lyn can you just explain to our audience right now how the step ladder format works for this uh women 's Masters competition of the sixteenth SEA Games\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah based on total pin points Butch we get the one two and three\n\n\nThe number rank number three and two battles for for one game only one game match\n\n\nAnd the winner of that goes to compete with the top qualifier who  who has gained the top seed fifteen balls\n\n\nAnd with it is a knock-out game\n\n\nIt 's the total pin point who gain\n\n\nYou have to beat your opponent twice right\n\n\n  To win the number two  \n\n<$B> \n\n So that   \n\n\nYes so so from what I understand the top qualifier only has to beat the challenger whoever she is only once to win the gold medal here in the women 's Masters event\n\n<$C> \n\nSo far the Philippine team uh has prepared good mental preparation for this type of a game because we just had our mock SEA Game wherein all uhm good players from the local local from organizations competing against each other and so so far we have we landed on the one two and three\n\n\nWe were placed under pressure\n\n\nReally\n\n<$B> \n\nSo uh we can see that the Philippine Bowling Congress did everything they could to get uh all the players here in high gear\n\n\nWe take a look at some of the previous winners so far already here in the women 's side of the bowling competition of the sixteenth SEA Games\n\n\nEarlier you saw the  triples which was won by Indonesia and now the latest doubles won by Malaysia with the Philippine team coming in second and third\n\n<$C> \n\nYes and one thing for sure Grace Young is really came here to to do her best because she 's a defending  Masters champion of the last SEA Games\n\n<$B> \n\nYes I believe uh in the previous game game number fourteen we saw a titanic struggle over lanes twenty-three and twenty-four between Liza Fernandez and Grace Young\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah uhm actually Grace Young uh did a two hundred forty-six game and Liza Fernandez did a two hundred thirty-four\n\n\nSo it was really a battle\n\n\nIt was a battle of strikes not of spares\n\n<$B> \n\nYes\n\n<$C> \n\nArianne was so close behind with the two hundred forty-five game\n\n<$B> \n\nExactly   \n\n\nOpen frame in the ninth uh uh <unclear> word </unclear> in the tenth uh going out on three straight strikes to H I N by one minute in the fourteenth game\n\n\nBut now this is the fifteenth and final game and uh after this only the three top players will remain in the women 's Masters finals, \n\n\nYes so right now we will now be going over to lanes number fifteen and sixteen to witness close hand a match taking place between Liza Fernandez and Popy Tambis who had won the gold medal in the women 's singles earlier last week\n\n<$C> \n\nYes actually right now lanes fifteen and sixteen on the first frame Liza made a strike and on the second frame she had a one down but was able to convert it and now Liza shot a double\n\n<$B> \n\nYes a double in bowling is two strikes two straight strikes and Liza Fernandez who as we mentioned is leading the field going into the fifteenth game\n\n\nYou saw her deliver a strike and this is her opponent in the match play division\n\n\nThat 's Popy Tambis\n\n<$C> \n\nUh while on another set of lanes Grace Young who is a contender for the top three position has only two spares and two splits and on another pair of lane wherein Arianne is, trying to make a run for it she has a strike and has split two spares\n\n<$B> \n\nYes we 're trying to get the scores as of game fourteen\n\n\nWhat we have here is a two uh game number thirteen which Liza Fernandez she 's she actually had the overnight lead uh Lyn\n\n\nThe way I understand it Bong Revilla was number two coming into the final seven games\n\n\nBut something has happened to Bong 's game and she 's right now at number four\n\n\nAnd I don't think she did so well in game fourteen\n\n<$C> \n\nYeah actually Bong is having a tough time right now maybe perhaps because of the lane condition 'cause as of three frames she has already two open frames\n\n\nSo it 's gonna be a little bit hard for her to get into the top three\n\n\nBut in the meantime Liza Fernandez has really prepared well for this game\n\n\nShe was a former flight stewardess and has really begged off from her work to prepare herself for the SEA Games\n\n<$B> \n\nSo you can see the amount of dedication that has to go into the pursuit of excellence here in the sport of bowling Lyn\n\n<$C> \n\nYes actually also Arianne has a slight knee injury but you can't see from her any injury at all\n\n\nSo she has mentally blocked off that injury\n\n\nActually we have uh the Philippine team has a court psychologist really to help you on your mental training because bowling is not only plain skill it 's also more on mental game mental training\n\n\nAnd we also have undergone some uh we have enrolled on <unclear> words </unclear> sport uh we went underwent training at Fit Center Philippines and we did some work-out\n\n<$B> \n\nI hope you 've seen Liza Fernandez getting her fourth strike in a row here in game number fifteen\n\n\nIt looks like she 's really bent on entering the step ladder final in the number one slot Lyn\n\n<$C> \n\nYes as far as Arianne Cerde&ntilde;a is concerned she just made the wash out wash out means uh leaving six for the head team and was able to convert it\n\n\nYou can see her intensity right now because this is the last game this is go for it and go for broke and Arianne has that skill and that intensity, \n\n<$B> \n\nUh earlier you saw in blue Liza Kwan one of the more popular popular players I believe here in the Southeast Asian Games   uh  bowling competition\n\n<$C> \n\n Uh yes   \n\n\nYes actually Liza Kwan as of the world F I Q held in Singapore was a silver medalist\n\n\nActually it was a big uh game for her\n\n\nIt was just on the last game that she made a five two hundred game to enter into the top three\n\n\nAnd she was uh the only Asian to qualify on the top three positions \n\n\nAnd right now I think Liza made another strike for making it a five  dagger  \n\n<$B> \n\nYes that 's five straight strikes thrown by Liza Fernandez, \n\n<$C> \n\nYou can see Liza 's form right now\n\n\nShe makes a five step delivery and really she hit a  Brooklyn  shot\n\n\nBut you know in bowling when it really scores what counts whether it 's on the left side of the head pin or you hit the right what is important is you get a strike because it 's the last game Butch\n\n<$B> \n\nYes and Liza Fernandez working on a probable two hundred eighty game if she manages to strike all the way out \n\n She needs five more strikes to accomplish the two eighty game\n\n<$C> \n\nAs far as Bong 's game right now it 's really, tough for her because she just has one mark and has a split on the fourth frame and a possible spare but you know Butch she needs more than that\n\n\nProbably a punch out which means a strike all the way probably <unclear> words </unclear> little to qualify, \n\n\nLiza right now made a heavy hit and she makes a baby split that is a convertible split\n\n\nIf she converts the split it 's going to be a very good game for her\n\n<$B> \n\nI believe she left the number three and ten pin standing now\n\n<$C> \n\nYes Butch actually she would just aim for pin six which is supposed to be in the middle of those two pins and Liza can do it because of her mental preparation right now and intensity\n\n<$B> \n\nYes Liza Fernandez uh\n\n\nIt 's a little bit worrying because the R P women 's team so far has failed to deliver a single gold medal Lyn\n\n<$C> \n\nUh yeah it was sort of a probably a sort of a not the right timing but then we had we have the line-up for it Butch\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$C> \n\nWe have Bong and uh Arianne Cerde&ntilde;a are very good uh combination for the doubles because Bong is a very experienced bowler twenty-one years actually in bowling and has so many records\n\n\nAnd Arianne Cerde&ntilde;a is still young but she is an Olympic medalist but you know breaks of the game that 's why they didn't make it for the doubles but they ran away with the silver\n\n\nAnd for the other contenders we just some had bad breaks of the game\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah bowling is a game in which uh you may be the best player in the world but if for one day there is somebody better then you don't win", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nHere in Manila the Games that started on November twenty-four is finally coming to a close\n\n\nAnd of course for the Philippines from the worst of times to the best of times we have seen our athletes do us proud and we have seen that as a country united and one we can see that we can overcome all odds in order to host these Southeast Asian Games\n\n\nA pleasant day this is Freddie Abando together with Sandra Dayco\n\n\nSandra the feeling here at the Rizal Memorial Stadium is one of celebration\n\n\nThere is joy there is jubilation and perhaps a game like this one is something that will never be matched in the history of the Southeast Asian Games because this is one of the most fiercely fought the Philippines coming close to striking the greatest upset in the history of the Games\n\n<$B> \n\nYes good afternoon Freddie and good afternoon Philippines\n\n\nYou were right Freddie that if I should say so say so it 's outright elation for for most of the participants and especially for the Filipino people the staging of the biggest ever biennial sportsfest here in Manila is really quite successful\n\n\nThat 's uh that 's an understatement in fact Freddie\n\n<$A> \n\nWell of course the crowd has been a very big factor in all the fronts in all the venues\n\n\nThere was no doubt that Filipino nationalism is on the rise Philippine flags waving all over cheering our athletes giving their best\n\n\nAnd if there 's one clear line to sum up the performance of the Filipino athletes in all the events it 's guts and glory\n\n\nAnd there 's no doubt that they have proven themselves to be the rising stars of sports in the ASEAN region\n\n<$B> \n\nYes particularly impressive of course was the large turn-out like you 've pointed out in all the venues for most events even though the more exotic ones the demonstration events a beautiful turn-out from the Filipino people\n\n\nThey all just went out and supported their countrymen in the in their bid for the gold\n\n<$A> \n\nFirst of all the most important thing that you 'll remember in these Southeast Asian Games is you know that the world is one big community and through the magic of satellites television not only here in the Philippines nationwide but the whole of ASEAN is watching us because they know this is an endeavor of countries nine countries who have come here for nine days for one thing sports excellence and friendship\n\n\nAnd we have really done it\n\n\nWe have forged a closer unity among our ASEAN brothers and there is no doubt that uh when our ASEAN brothers will go back to their countries there will be so many stories to talk about what they have seen what they have experienced in Manila\n\n\nAnd there is no doubt that we as Filipinos have come of age and we have seen that as a people this country can move forward\n\n<$B> \n\nI think Freddie the Games in itself our hosting of the sixteenth edition of the Southeast Asian Games is a demonstration of our resiliency our ability to rise up above all the difficulties we 've gone through the flashfloods in Ormoc uh Leyte and uh the the the earthquakes and all the  natural calamities and  even the man-made disasters \n\n Definitely we have proven that we are one nation we are able to rise up and we are able to host something of this magnitude something that would foster greater brotherhood and sportsmanship among the peoples in the region\n\n<$A> \n\nYou know in nineteen eighty-one they called that a renaissance of sports there has been a slide after nineteen eighty-seven when we performed with the performance of  fifty-nine gold medals in the Jakarta Games when we only had twenty-six gold medals in the SEA Games in Kuala Lumpur\n\n\nBut definitely ninety-one gold medals that will be difficult to match in the history of the Games \n\n\nAt this stage we would like to turn you over at the uh main stadium because Her Excellency President Corazon Aquino will be here is now here to declare the closing of the Games \n\n And there 's no doubt that Her Excellency there where the Trade Secretary the Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the Manila Southeast Asian Games has been instrumental in pushing through these particular Southeast Asian Games despite the string of calamities we 've had which started in July sixteen nineteen ninety and ended with the Ormoc tragedy where more than seven thousand of our people died in that uh typhoon\n\n\nAnd of course this as Eric Buhain sums it up  I wanted to give our people something to smile about my triumph is their triumph  \n\n\nAnd there 's no doubt that the President for being here this afternoon is here to celebrate a new joy a new dawn in the life of this country\n\n<$B> \n\nOf course Freddie maybe as a symbol of her elation over the tremendous performance of Filipino athletes you can see the President is wearing the logo of the SEA Games on her beautiful yellow dress\n\n<$A> \n\nThe traditional yellow dress which symbolized Cory power is here\n\n\nAnd that power which started in eighty-six now very much alive here at the Rizal Stadium as we now have the national anthem of our country,  \n\n\nThere you have it the national anthem  \n\n The crowd here it 's a very electrifying mood\n\n\nThe country is in a state of euphoria\n\n\nSandra\n\n<$B> \n\nWell definitely coming of course after that string of victories uh the past eleven days of the SEA Games\n\n\nWe definitely feel very good very proud of ourselves Freddie and uh like like uh what Eric Buhain a while ago said this I think should all the more inspire the country to to to move forward that if we 've set our minds to it we will be able to achieve anything we want to \n\n<$A> \n\nThere 's no doubt about it\n\n\nThe Filipino spirit has triumphed\n\n\nThe triumph of our athletes is the triumph of our nation\n\n\nThere you can see the people near you people who have milled around here in the Stadium\n\n\nSome of them already starting to come from the south end of the Stadium because uh it is only now that they are coming in and more are still out waiting for the start of the parade\n\n\nA beautiful cultural presentation later on here at the Rizal Memorial Stadium  \n\n\nYou know going back to those twelve days Sandra when we started the opening ceremonies obviously the question is will we perform very well as a country for the hosting, be successful and after twelve days we can definitely say that we did, this country proud and the whole region proud because we did and the Philippine Filipino ability and style in hosting these Games\n\n<$B> \n\nI think we performed even more than our expectations actually\n\n Originally uh the sports officials were uh thinking of getting about sixty golds for the Philippines well we certainly surpassed that\n\n\nRight now Freddie we are seeing the mascot of the sixteenth edition of the Southeast Asian Games  Kiko Labuyo  a warmer friendlier representation of the wild rooster native to our country\n\n<$A> \n\nNo doubt there  Kiko Labuyo  must be celebrating himself now because it feels very good but of course there 's a feeling of nostalgia also in every participant of these Southeast Asian Games and all those who have come here to watch these closing ceremonies\n\n\nYou know closing ceremonies can always be very heartbreaking because after twelve days of fiercely-fought competitions in all the venues you win new friends you lose uh some medals and yet the whole spirit uh which comes in you is why it 's not only winning but I guess winning medals but winning friends which is essential in these Games\n\n<$B> \n\nWell as a as symbol of of winning you have the Victory Girls parading down the track oval uh carrying the SEA Games flag\n\n<$A> \n\nThe SEA Games flag uh taking its panel of blue for the final march here at the Rizal Memorial Stadium\n\n\nThousands upon thousands of people here inside and those who 're watching millions more on television and those listening over radio\n\n\nAnd there 's no doubt that for those volunteers who have been a part of these Southeast Asian Games from the Manila Organizing Committee I think more than two thousand of them they must be very proud that despite uh maybe the lack of resources before they have given their very best in serving the athletes and delegates and all the tourists who have come over to Manila for the Southeast Asian Games\n\n<$B> \n\nYou know Freddie the very best minds have participated have volunteered their services for the SEA Games and the more beautiful you know Filipinas are certainly here\n\n\nThey represented the country as Victory Girls in this edition of the SEA Games and uh these people are volunteers actually\n\n\nAnd they have volunteered to award the medals to all the deserving athletes who have conquered their respective contests\n\n<$A> \n\nWell we now have the parade of the flags of the different competing nations in the Southeast Asian Games\n\n\nNine countries from the whole of ASEAN competing and battling for three hundred thirty gold medals in the Southeast Asian Games and of course for the terrific performance by Indonesia and the Philippines\n\n\nYou know during the first two days the Philippines did very well\n\n\nNine gold medals first day   second day  nine gold medals\n\n<$B> \n\n Uh uh   \n\n<$A> \n\nWe led for two days\n\n\nFrom there on it was Indonesia\n\n\nBut in the last three days we gave Indonesia its biggest scare in the history of the Games\n\n\nSixteen gold medals on Saturday and sixteen last Sunday a total of thirty-two gold medals\n\n\nAnd Indonesia was thinking what does the Philippines have and there 's the possibility that the Philippines will win the overall crown\n\n<$B> \n\nWell Freddie uh I 'd like to point out at this point as opposed to the opening ceremonies which was also pomp and pageantry and <unclear> words </unclear> atmosphere today 's closing ceremonies of the SEA Games is going to be very meaningful\n\n\nNow we see the athletes this time breaking the barriers of their uh nationalities and marching according to sport or event which they have participated in\n\n\nHand-in-hand they are they 're marching down the Stadium\n\n<$A> \n\nIt 's amazing that after uh ten days of bitter competition in the playing field just going for that gold medal the pride and prestige of knowing that you can win it for your country there you are now locked in arms together as friends\n\n\nAnd you have to forget the bitter rivalry on the playing field and knowing that you can move together and share the dream and opportunity experience of knowing that after everything has been said and done you are after all friends and the medal is just only one aspect of these Games\n\n<$B> \n\nYes that 's right Freddie\n\n\nApart from uh winning and and conquering one 's self and then making one 's country really proud the SEA Games in itself is is after all for fostering brotherhood among uh the peoples of the the nine countries represented here in the Southeast Asian Games\n\n\nAnd for the benefit of our viewers who do not know, a lot of socials were uh scheduled and and and the athletes themselves participated in a lot of these events uhm they were able to witness a lot of cultural presentations and they shared a lot of time together\n\n<$A> \n\nIf one is to chronicle these Games there were so many stories that need to be told retold written in for future generations to talk about\n\n\nBut of course before we go to those stories of each personal athlete let 's go to the medal tally after today 's competition in the marathon\n\n\nIndonesia winning the overall crown ninety-two gold medals eighty-seven silvers sixty-nine bronzes\n\n\nThe Philippines a proud second ninety-one golds sixty-one eighty uh\n\n<$B> \n\nEighty-five\n\n<$A> \n\nSixty-one silver medals and   eighty-five bronze medals  \n\n<$B> \n\n Eighty-five bronze medals   \n\n\nYes the slimmest margin ever in the history of the SEA Games by the way Freddie that ninety-two ninety-one finish between the Philippines and Indonesia\n\n\nOur congratulations of course to the Indonesian contingent\n\n\nThey really put up a good fight and so did we\n\n\nThird in line of course is Thailand\n\n\nThey got seventy-two gold medals they took home eighty silvers and seventy-one bronze medals for a total of two hundred twenty-three\n\n\nDown the line we have Malaysia\n\n\nTremendous performance to win thirty-six gold medals thirty-eight silver and bronze sixty-five\n\n\nThen Singapore is at fifth eighteen gold medals thirty-two silvers and forty-four bronze\n\n\nFollowed by Myanmar with a seven sixteen twenty-eight count\n\n\nBrunei Darussalam with eight bronzes and Laos of course participated very well and Vietnam seven golds twelve silvers and ten bronze\n\n<$A> \n\nThere you have it the account of the sixteenth Southeast Asian Games",

two of the Amateur Boxing Competition at the Sixteenth South Asian\nGames between Rolando Escobar and Joko Soriyono of Indonesia okay\n\n\nSo I would like to repeat Ernesto Coronel winning against

another right oh this time Escobar scoring a big right to the\nchin of Soriyono\n\n\nEscobar is backing out, \n\n\nLooking at his range right now is Rolando Escobar of the\nPhilippines and Soriyono is backing out\n\n\nAnd there goes a big left by uh Soriyono to the face of Escobar\n\n\nA left right combination this time by Soriyono and Escobar is\nsquinting\n\n\nOkay there goes the break, \n\n\nOkay a left by Escobar to the chin of Soriyono and the attack by\nEscobar right now and then  medyo may tumamang ulo sa  chin\n\n ni Escobar  \n\n\nOkay so  dalawa nabigyan ng dalawang  warning\n\n itong si Soriyono ng  Indonesia for not listening to the\nreferee  pagsigaw ng  break  hindi nakikinig  \n\n\nLeft right combination by Soriyono and there goes, a no ducking\nby Escobar

for pushing, \n\n\nA left right by Soriyono to the chin of uh Escobar\n\n\nEscobar right cross it 's wild one a right upper cut and a head\nblow by uh by Soriyono\n\n\nAnd Escobar is counted out\n\n\nOkay so  medyo  groggy  itong si Escobar doon\nsa  head blow  na 'yon kaya't nabigyan po ng  eight\ncounts  itong si Rolando Escobar  \n\n\nOkay the uh count is finished and Escobar and since groggy  \nsiya nakorner siya  \n\n\nLeft right combination by Soriyono another eight standing count by\nEscobar\n\n\nOkay so  pangalawa po ito mukhang uh hindi maganda para kay\nEscobar itong laban na ito  \n\n\nOkay  laban ulit  \n\n\nA left by Escobar to the chin of Soriyono\n\n\nSoriyono wants to end this fight\n\n\nLeft right combination\n\n\nOkay so another eight mandatory count for Escobar and uh maybe this\nwill be the end of the bout  tatlong  eight counts  na\npo ito kaya't  automatically this will be the end of the bout\n\n\nOkay so  referee stopped contest compulsory count limit\n\n\n 'Yan po ang magiging uh magiging uh,  uh judging\n\n ng mga  juries  natin dito  \n\n\nOkay so Indonesia wins in this bout\n\n\nIndonesia Joko Soriyono against uh Rolando Escobar of

\n\n\nBoxing  ho  will begin at six o'clock in the evening\nand uh we 'll feature semi final bouts  bale  seven bouts also\nin store for us tomorrow in the fifth day of action of the Sixteenth\nSoutheast Asian Games\n\n\n Ang nag-  report  po sa atin ay si Danny\nRomero  \n\n\nThis was held earlier and uh this is the four by one hundred meter\nfree style relay women finals\n\n\nAnother exciting offering in the third or fourth day of action of\nthe Sixteenth Southeast Asian Games Manila , \n\n\nAnd our colleague who covered the swimming event the four by one\nhundred  uh meter medley relay for men finals of course none\nother than Rene Monteclaro\n\n\nAnd here 's that report\n\n<$C> \n\n Magandang gabi po sa inyong lahat mga kaibigan\n\n \n\n\nWe 're back here at the Rizal Memorial Swimming Pool for the fifth\nand final event of the evening and that 's the four by four hundred meter\nmedley relay for men\n\n\nTop favorite for the event is the quartet from the Philippines\ncomposed of, Ryan Papa Lee Concepcion Eric Buhain and Leo Najera\n\n\nThey will be swimming on lane number four\n\n\nSwimming on lane number five will be the quartet from Singapore\ncomposed of Lim Conjuc that 's David Lim Ong Yemeng Conong Kit and Ang Peng\nShiong\n\n\nThese are the quartet this is the quartet for uh Singapore\n\n\nSwimming on lane number three Singapore will be swimming on lane\nnumber five swimming on lane number three is the quartet from Thailand\ncomposed of Duliarit Phuantong, Paratatong <unclear> name </unclear> \nNarong Tantayatong

Naghahanda na po sa mga sandaling ito at medyo itong si Leo\nNajera ay nakalimutang magdala ng  swimming trunk  ano\n\n\nKaya hinihintay pa  and then  nagpalit lang siya ng\n\n swimming trunk\n\n\n 'Yon po ang naging dahilan ng mga  cheering  \nsa mga sandaling ito dito sa may  pool side  at sa mga\nnanonood  \n\n\n Itong  final event this is a four by four hundred\nmeter medley relay\n\n\n Tinitingnan ko pa kung sino ang unang tatalon para sa\nPilipinas  \n\n\nIt usually starts off with a back stroke uh if I get it right in a\nan individual or a medley relay  apat na tao apat na iba't-ibang\n\n strokes  ang tatakbuhin nila\n\n\nAt uh, ang nangyayari ay hinihintay pa natin  \nsi Leo Najera nang matapos niyang ayusin ang kanyang sarili at uh nagpalit\nsiya ng  swimming trunks  ano uh may humingi may tumatakbo\nkasing may dala-dalang uh o  additional  na panibagong\n\n swimming trunks  para kay Leo Najera ng Pilipinas\n\n\nItong si Leo Najera itong  uh U S bred and U S trained uh\nhe grew up in the United States of a Filipino father and American mother and\nuh, has been swimming for the University of Southern California or uh\nexcuse me I stand corrected University of California Berkeley campus\n\n\nUh he will be teaming up with Lee Concepcion Ryan Papa and uh Eric\nBuhain for the Philippines\n\n\n Hindi pa natin natatanaw ang kanilang uh magiging  \nsequence\n\n\nI think it 's going to be uh Leo Najera uh swimming first for the\nPhilippines  uh hindi naghugas lang siya nagbasa lang siya ng buhok\n, uh hindi pa yata natitiyak mga kaibigan  \n\n\nWe 're getting ready for the finals uh of the four by four hundred\nfour by four hundred meter uh medley relay with the Philippines hot favorite\n\n\n Sinasabi nga ng iba  sure gold for the Philippines\n\n\nWe 'll probably end up with two golds one silver and one bronze\nbut that 's not good enough to dislodge Thailand for the evening who have\nalready garnered two golds two silvers and one bronze from one final event or\nfour final events\n\n\nSo  titingnan natin kung  at least  \nmakapantay man lang tayo sa  gold medal tally  at uh medyo mas\nnakarami ang  Thailand\n\n\n May mga  events  kasi kanina na  \neither one two or one three or two three  ang  Thailand\n\n katulad nitong sa uh, itong sa uh  one thousand five\nhundred\n\n\nBy the way  ito nag-umpisa na po  \n\n\nIt 's

losing the number one rank seeding to Italy in one set to three and finally this team this Russian team gets the second place in pool B in the preliminaries\n\n\nAnd Cuba on the other hand is currently in third place in the team standing from the  preliminary in pool pool A losing uh two matches against Brazil and the Netherlands in three straight sets but winning the matches against Spain in three three sets to one and uh Egypt three straight sets and Australia also in three straight sets\n\n\nAnd the winner of this match will end up going up against the winner of the Brazil Argentina match\n\n\nAnd here we go, \n\n\nNow you should watch out for Yakolev of Russia number ten and in the Cuban side Dennis Angel Dennis who can really fly Sev\n\n<$C> \n\nYes and this is our first sit-in into the men 's competition because of the schedule that we 've followed here\n\n\nAnd the men 's game  mas mabilis ano   mas uh   \n\n<$B> \n\n Yes this is much faster yes   \n\n\nThat 's right\n\n\nThis is really fast\n\n\nAnd uh you know if you 're used to seeing power volleyball in the women the men 's uh well you know of course it 's expected that it 's gonna be faster because of the power of these uh these guys\n\n<$C> \n\nSo how each one manages the power dealt by each other will be the factor here and you were absolutely correct\n\n<$B> \n\nYakolev with that point\n\n<$C> \n\n Sobra lumilipad talaga si Yakolev  \n\n\nYakolev also is quite tall standing six seven\n\n<$B> \n\nBut you know it was really an interesting match these Russians played against the Koreans because uh they really didn't expect that \n\n They almost lost that match\n\n<$C> \n\n Sabi mo nga nung  bus trip  natin papunta rito medyo nakakapanghinayang din na nawala yung mga  Koreans because they did quite well   in the course of the tournament  \n\n<$B> \n\n Yes yes   \n\n\nAnd uh last night we we saw that match the Americans going up the Korean women\n\n<$C> \n\n Sa  women 's  ano  \n\n<$B> \n\nThat was really something else\n\n\nAnd uh the Koreans almost got that one\n\n\nAnd they could have just moved to the   semi-finals already  \n\n<$C> \n\n Yes   \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd snatched that one from the Americans\n\n<$C> \n\nAs of the moment this stands at three two in favor of the Russians\n\n\nHowever it it 's the Cubans who will be serving\n\n<$B> \n\nPavel Pimienta now on your screen to serve\n\n<$C> \n\n   Tapos agad ang puntos ano    \n\n<$B> \n\n Oh what a shot   \n\n\nThat 's that was Olikhver of Russia\n\n<$C> \n\n<unclear> words </unclear>  pati yung  first name  niya  Russian <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\nJump serve\n\n\nGo to the right\n\n\nStrong one\n\n\nWhat a shot\n\n\nOsvaldo Hernandez stands six eight\n\n\nHis serve strong one again from Hernandez as Yakolev is easily putting that one over\n\n\nFrom the left it 's  Angel Dennis\n\n<$C> \n\nThe Cuban squad extremely loaded unveiling quickly the arsenal of strength\n\n\nNow who will be craftier here scrappier perhaps may have the edge\n\n\nLet 's see let 's let this game flow\n\n<$B> \n\nHernandez nice service there\n\n\n Alam mo Sev yang si Angel Dennis  uh he 's he is actually short  'no  he 's uh compared to the other players\n\n\nHe 's just six four but that guy can really hit the ball way up you know he can fly\n\n<$C> \n\n Karamihan naman dito talagang lumilipad e  \n\n<$B> \n\nSometimes uh small but terrible  e di ba  \n\n<$C> \n\nActually  sa T V mukhang hindi ganun kalaki 'no pero pag katabi ninyo silang nag-aantay kayo ng bus diyan sa labas mukha kaming mga dwende kahit sa  women 's side  ano  \n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's true\n\n\nAnd the winner from Tetyukhin of Russia\n\n<$C> \n\nTalk about height  anong  average height  ng  Cuba\n\n\nSix six\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$C> \n\n Sa kabilang panig naman  and uh we 'll see this point being played while we check out the average height of the Russian side\n\n\nThe Russian side the average height six seven\n\n\nThat 's tall\n\n<$B> \n\nHernandez putting that one away\n\n\nGoing down in the Russian squad is Tetyukhin\n\n\nToo strong\n\n\nHere 's the team captain Yosvany Hernandez\n\n\n That 's a club  \n\n<$C> \n\n Patay na ang puntos oo  \n\n<$B> \n\nNot being able to get that one\n\n\nHe was blocked\n\n\nYou know Kazakhov is quite a big quite a tall uh player\n\n<$C> \n\nSeven one  ano  \n\n<$B> \n\nOh yeah he is always there you know when you need him to make points but that that error is from Kazakhov \n\n<$C> \n\n Alam mo itong sa  international volleyball  ano patuloy na na nare-  redefine  yung  game  dati-dati hindi mo makikita ang mga  seven one  pupunta na ng  basketball  yan  but now  dami nang  seven one  ano  \n\n\nAnd Russia can like that gentleman on your screens right now\n\n\nThat is the gentleman who stands seven one\n\n<$B> \n\nYakolev\n\n\nIt goes to the left down the line\n\n\nThere was there was a touch\n\n\nThe point goes to Cuba\n\n\nAnd the score now is eight seven\n\n<$C> \n\nBecause this is the first technical time-out when we reach the level of eight we press the button for the first technical time-out\n\n\nWe 'll use it,  \n\n efficiency rate rather of seventy-five percent\n\n\nThe attack points six to four the edge to the Cubans\n\n\n Hindi nagtatagal ang bola walang uh hindi na umiikot ano  \n\n\n Ang  game is set attack set attack and who overpowers the other is going to be the trend here\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's men 's volleyball for you\n\n\nEight all\n\n\nDiago, \n\n\nHammering that down was number six of Cuba Ivan Benito Ruiz Cuesta, a long name Sev\n\n<$C> \n\n Oo galit siya nung  Grade One  kasi ang daming isusulat na pangalan e  \n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's right\n\n\nFrom the back that was Tetyukhin swept over by the  back set\n\n<$C> \n\n Huli  \n\n\nWell done\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd the Cubans getting that point, from the net\n\n<$C> \n\nAngel Dennis stands six four doing an excellent job of protecting their surface and protecting them from any kind of attack\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Cubans ahead now by two\n\n\nBack set\n\n\nThat 's in\n\n\nGreat shot   <unclear> name </unclear>  \n\n<$C> \n\n  Alam mo sa  men 's volleyball    mas nagiging  more valuable  yung  role  nung   libero   kung minsan yung mga uh  announcers  natin sa  Australia  libero  Italian  yan pero itong   libero   ang gagamitin natin  \n\n\nSo  sa  power game  ano importante ang laro ng   libero   ano  \n\n<$B> \n\nOh yeah\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that Sev in the women 's team there is no  libero    but in the men 's team  \n\n<$C> \n\n  Sa  Cuba  sa  Cuba   \n\n<$B> \n\nThere is there is a  libero  \n\n<$C> \n\n Kanya-kanyang  philosophy  e  \n\n\nThe Cuban team which is uh going to go up against Brazil in a major major showdown in the women 's category\n\n\n  They 're actually looking for a double  e   \n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's tomorrow\n\n<$C> \n\nThey 're looking for a double \n\n \n\n\nUh Cubans playing well here  ano  \n\n<$B> \n\n  Great blocking  \n\n<$C> \n\n  Malutong    \n\n<$B> \n\nSingle blocking there by Hernandez blocking Yakolev of Russia\n\n<$C> \n\nAs you mentioned the Cubans ending up only in third place in their pool which is pool A dropping two matches and uh anything can happen here because one loss you 're gone\n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's right\n\n\n  Just like last night  \n\n<$C> \n\n Yes   \n\n<$B> \n\nThe the U S almost lost that match against the Koreans\n\n\nThat 's it, Olikhver, not successful over the net\n\n<$C> \n\n Natutuwa talaga ako dito sa  back-up dancers  yung nasa nagwa-  warm up  sa kanto  endless stretching  yan e ano  \n\n<$B> \n\nOh yes because they can be called to play   anytime  \n\n<$C> \n\n Anytime   \n\n\nAnytime they don't occupy the bench  e  \n\n\n Sa  culture  ng  volleyball  ayaw nilang paupuin lahat ng  players  dun sa  bench area  yun lang pinalitan ipapalit at saka yung mga kailangan lang  \n\n<$B> \n\nAnd do you know the people who were there at the Phil Sports at the Grand Prix\n\n\nThey 're pretty familiar with that already because they saw they saw Liela Barros there   a lot of times  \n\n<$C> \n\n  Oo    \n\n<$B> \n\nBecause she hardly played because she had an injury and she wasn't playing at her best\n\n<$C> \n\nBut I think she 's playing very well\n\n<$B> \n\nOh she 's playing   very well  in the Olympics\n\n<$C> \n \n\n\n Look at these Russians trying to pursue that one\n\n<$B> \n\nTetyukhin\n\n<$C> \n\nTetyukhin did not want to give up\n\n\nThat was way outside\n\n\nThe Cubans are dictating the flow of this first set fourteen eleven\n\n\nThey are ahead\n\n<$B> \n\nHere 's Dennis Angel Angel Dennis with uh jump service\n\n\nTetyukhin now, blocked\n\n<$C> \n\n Pero pasok  \n\n<$B> \n\nThat 's in\n\n<$C> \n\n Pasok  \n\n<$B> \n\nCubans getting another point there fifteen eleven now\n\n<$C> \n\nCubans doing a little of everything not allowing the Russians to get any of their cannons firing and uh the Cubans just simply awesome here on the first set\n\n<$B> \n\nTwo teams counterpart of the two best teams here in the world in fact Cuba and Russia in the women 's volleyball\n\n\n  Now we 're seeing the men  \n\n<$C> \n\n Service A service A unleashed that time   \n\n\nAnd the Russian side has fallen behind as we hit our second technical time-out\n\n\nWe will be back  \n\n<$B> \n\nVolleyball quarterfinals you 're seeing Russia against Cuba\n\n\nYou know in attack  percentage uh seventy-five percent for Cuba and fifty sixty percent for Russia\n\n\nSo Cuba has been hitting a lot of balls there in this first set\n\n<$C> \n\nAnd already the Russians have committed two errors\n\n\nIt used to be the Cubans with four and just in about every statistical category the Cubans have the edge and the score reveals and confirms that particular advantage those advantages in fact\n\n\n Ang ganda nung  style  nitong si Angel ano uh si Dennis Angel ano  \n\n<$B> \n\nOh yes\n\n<$C> \n\n Sa  side view  muna tapos saka niya pakakawalan  \n\n<$B> \n\nHe really has a different or unique kind of uh service\n\n\nFrom the back right Hernandez, through the blockers of the Russians\n\n\nThat 's Hernandez\n\n<$C> \n\nThe Cubans  ano kita mo  inspired  ano  inspired  ang laro nila  well because they 're ahead  ano  \n\n\nBut at the same time they 're playing at a very high energetic level\n\n\nThe Russians keep in mind lost only once and that was as Maila mentioned to the Italians\n\n\nFour sets  yun  the rest of the win  nahirapan sila nahirapan sila sa  Korea  kagaya ng nasabi mo 'no  three two  yun  \n\n<$B> \n\nOh yes\n\n<$C> \n\nFive setter, bang  hanep  \n\n<$B> \n\nThere goes to the tall one\n\n\nKazakhov hammering that one\n\n\nKazakhov\n\n<$C> \n\nKazakhov\n\n\nSeven one  ang kanyang tindig gaya ng nabanggit natin kanina nagalit  \n\n<$B> \n\nAll his might up and down there <unclear> Gamaliel </unclear.> to serve\n\n\nGood one \n\n Diago back set to Hernandez off the blockers the Cubans getting another point\n\n\nEighteen twelve is our score here in the first set\n\n<$C> \n\nCubans getting so much success off the spike off the attack\n\n<$B> \n\nTeam captain Hernandez committing a <unclear> 1 word </unclear> there\n\n\nHere 's the tall guy Kazakhov of Russia to serve\n\n\nDiago goes to the left\n\n\nGreat shot Ivan Benito Ruiz Cuesta  long name\n\n<$C> \n\nCuesta  walang problema kay Cuesta na yan  despite the presence of that double coverage and the preparation of the back row that was successful\n\n\n   Huli   \n\n<$B> \n\n That 's center back   \n\n<$C> \n\n Ang ganda ng depensa ng  Cuba\n\n<$B> \n\nGamaliel and there goes uh good shot off the blockers <unclear> name </unclear> \n\n\nNineteen fourteen now\n\n<$C> \n\nOne of the rare times that the Russians get something off the block\n\n<$B> \n\nFrom the left blocked that 's in\n\n\nRussia getting that point\n\n<$C> \n\nYes two successive points by the Russians and trying to inch in here because they don't want the Cubans to reach twenty  kasi pag  twenty  diyan diretso na    this this set  oo   \n\n<$B> \n\n That 's the route   \n\n<$C> \n\nThis set is going into fifteen minutes now\n\n<$B> \n\nDiago quickly goes to Pavel Pimienta\n\n<$C> \n\n Alam mo  when you need points in uhm flash the quick set is the best way to go    kasi walang walang aksaya e   \n\n<$B> \n\n Sure is   \n\n<$C> \n\n Walang  chance for the block  hirap nahirap ang  block  diyan  \n\n<$B> \n\nHere goes the rally point\n\n\n  That 's the exciting thing with volleyball  \n\n<$C> \n\n Uh actually   \n\n<$B> \n\nGood serve from Gamaliel, \n\n\nGreat dig\n\n\nYakolev gets the point\n\n\nFourteen sixteen now is our score\n\n\nThe Russians trying to come back\n\n<$C> \n\n Saka parang nagpapainit 'no malamig ang,  flies by maybe they 'll be better in the second set\n\n<$B> \n\nLet 's see \n\n Hernandez wow\n\n<$C> \n\n Malutong ang  spikes  ng mga Cubano  \n\n\n Alam mo ang na no-  notice <indigo> natin kaagad yun ang  confidence  mag-  toss\n\n\n Alam nila ang gagawin nila kaagad walang  uh second guessing\n\n<$B> \n\nActually  pareho tayo 'no swack tayo dun nagagalingan tayo sa mga  setters  dito  \n\n Of course this is world-class volleyball\n\n<$C> \n\n Oo e  \n\n<$B> \n\nBut then you know the setting is the hardest hardest position in volleyball\n\n<$C> \n\n Oo galit sa yo ang mundo pag  <unclear> words

Philippines\n\n\nDigs we have three for the Philippines and five for Singapore\n\n\nAnd uh service errors this is where we had a problem with Singapore\n\n\nThey had two whereas uh Philippines only had one, \n\n<$A> \n\nWell Singapore starting strong in the third game coming up with two good attacks\n\n\nThey lead it one to nothing, \n\n\nKamangyan to Sunico Babylonia gets blocked\n\n\nAnd Kamangyan and uh I believe that was number seven, Malinag\n\n<$B> \n\nYes and on the part of the Singaporeans uh that ball went off the head of number seven Ang Yan Bun Kyan\n\n\nBut the ball

lot\n\n<$B> \n\nBarina was wooed out of retirement to come and play in the Southeast Asian games\n\n\nService error for Paglinawan as her serve touched off the tip of the tape\n\n Side out for for Myanmar\n\n\nServing now is number eight\n\n\nThis is Tan, \n\n\nSome uh clarification is being made by the referee\n\n\nIt 's the first referee from Singapore Mr Ang Shio Ong  \n\n\nGood\n\n\nPicked by Arceo\n\n\nBut seems like, somebody touched the net\n\n\nThat was number eight Arceo\n\n\nSo it 's one all Myanmar ties the game\n\n\nPaglinawan quick set to Barina, \n\n<$C> \n\nThe free ball yes goes to the Philippine side\n\n\nThe referee calls it a ball handling double hit uhm by uh number eleven Apostol\n\n<$A> \n\nSo it 's now two to one Myanmar on top\n\n\nServing once again is Chien the

{"text": "<$A> \n\nDr Villacorta Mr del Rosario thank you for the rare fortune of having been introduced two times  and therefore exposed to the hazards of double jeopardy  \n\n\nLet me place those two introductions in proper perspective, \n\n\nThe truth of the matter is that I was such a lousy student I decided to be a professor no reflection on professors who may be present here today  \n\n\nAnd after having taught law for almost thirteen years, I decided I was such a lousy professor I had better be a dean  no reflection on deans who may be present here\n\n\nAnd after four years as a dean of law I decided I was such a lousy dean I had better run for Congress  \n\n\nAnd indeed, I became Congressman representing the second district of Rizal\n\n\nBut after four years I decided I was such a lousy Congressman and so ran for the Senate\n\n\nNow this is my third term as Senator of the Philippines and I 'm beginning to toy with the idea  that perhaps I 'm such a lousy Senator I had better run for the Presidency if I were qualified for it for the Presidency of the Rizal High School Alumni Association  \n\n\n Akala ninyo kung ano ang sasabihin ko  \n\n\nIn any event, Mr President Pedro Mora of  Ley  La Salle and the other presidents who are here in our midst my dear fellow students I am sure that everyone is aching to know about the latest developments in the Liberal Party which culminated in one, the resignation of my dear friend Erap Estrada\n\n\nTwo the unanimous acceptance of that resignation by the executive committee of the Liberal Party\n\n\nAnd three the nomination by the executive committee through the consistory method of voting of two candidates for President and two candidates for Vice-President\n\n\nActually this is the first step  chosen  by the Liberal Party in order to eliminate the practice of bribery and vote buying the curse and at once the evil of the old system of politics in this country\n\n\nThere are therefore three steps in choosing the L P candidate for President and Vice-President\n\n\nThe first step is at the level of the thirty-five-man executive committee which met last March eight at the residence of former President Diosdado Macapagal\n\n\nThe first two names with the highest votes for President and Vice-President are then forwarded to the national directorate composed of six hundred party leaders\n\n\nThe directorate which will meet in June or July will either ratify or reject the said nominations\n\n\nAnd the third step will be when the national convention composed of around four thousand leaders of the Liberal Party throughout the country meets on or around December twenty-nine nineteen ninety-one and renders the final verdict on who shall be the Liberal Party candidate for President and the Liberal candidate for Vice-President\n\n\nLast March eight, that is to say the other Friday when the executive committee was holding its consistory a method which I shall explain very shortly my friend Erap reportedly charged that I was a dictator and that I wanted to control the entire selection process by handpicking the thirty-five members of the executive committee\n\n\nYou might recall that after his resignation and this was featured on television that same evening and in the newspapers the next morning I said I wish Senator Erap Estrada well and that I do not  wish to speak ill of him \n\n\nThe reason for that statement is that in truth Erap was misinformed or ill-advised which is why only last week he denied that he had called me a dictator and offered apologies to me through the mass media\n\n\nIn any case allow me to say something that is a matter of record\n\n\nI was imprisoned twice because I was against absolute rule I was against dictatorship\n\n\nFirst during the Japanese occupation when as a young man of twenty  sabagay bata pa rin ako hanggang ngayon   when as a young man of twenty I joined the underground\n\n\nI was the editor of the guerilla paper in the province of Rizal, was captured by the  Kempetai  the Japanese Military Police severely tortured in the presence of my father\n\n\nI thought then that my father must have suffered a thousand sufferings he must have died a thousand deaths\n\n\nAnd then I was transferred to Fort Santiago and you will find the plaque there later sentenced to fifteen years of hard labor  kaya't hindi po lamang ako senador presidente ng senado  ex-convict  po rin ako sapagkat nagsilbi po rin ako sa  Muntinlupa\n\n\nAnd of course during the Marcos years after the release of Ninoy Aquino in May nineteen eighty  ako na abogado ni Ninoy ako naman ang pinaaresto ni Marcos at inihalili doon sa kulungan ni Ninoy doon sa Fort Bonifacio , \n\n\nIt would therefore be a little strange  bago ko makalimutan mabuti sabihin ko sa inyo  \n\n\nBefore, I was released by Marcos, there was tremendous pressure brought to bear on him from within and from without\n\n\nMarcos must have been surprised that he received telegrams even from Poland which was then under communism\n\n\nActually a fellow worker of mine in the World Council of Churches sent him a telegram urging my release\n\n\nI was released before the end of nineteen eighty-eight  ngunit ang pagkakasalita ni Marcos doon sa kanyang  directive  ay napakaganda  \n\n\nHe said I am hereby releasing Salonga from military custody and placing him under house arrest under the custody of his wife Mrs Lydia Salonga  \n\n\nWhen I got home that night I was debating in my mind as to which was better  military custody or marital custody  \n\n\nIn fact when I got home I saw on my desk a note from my  pamangkin  for whom many of you might have voted during the last election \n\n \n\n\nAnd I sent a quick note to him I said Dear Nephew do not pity me \n\n\nLong before the imposition of martial law I had always been under marital law  \n\n\n Ang hirap paniwalang-paniwala naman doon ang misis ko  so I have to reassure audiences that I 'm still the commander-in-chief at home  \n\n\nAnd that my last words every time I got out of home are of course yes I agree darling  \n\n\nAnyway let 's go back  baka madiskaril tayo , \n\n\nWhat I 'm trying to say is that it 's a little strange that I who fought dictatorships and risked my whole life should act like a dictator\n\n\nAnyway let us review the latest developments\n\n\nToward the end of nineteen ninety last year Erap Estrada and Tito Guingona our majority floor leader in the Senate approached me separately and told me about their understanding to entrust to me as probable Presidential nominee the prerogative of selecting my Vice-Presidential teammate\n\n\nNote that this is the usual practice in democracies like the United States and the Philippines\n\n\nIn the Philippines you will recall Ramon Magsaysay chose Carlos P Garcia as his running mate\n\n\nMacapagal chose Emmanuel Pelaez\n\n\nPresident Marcos chose Fernando Lopez\n\n\nIn the United States John Kennedy chose Lyndon Johnson\n\n\nReagan chose George Bush\n\n\nAnd George Bush chose Dan Quayle\n\n\nSo there is nothing dictatorial in that kind of a practice\n\n\nBut I was not comfortable with the idea for one simple reason\n\n\nBoth Erap and Tito are very close to me\n\n\nI am the  ninong  in marriage of Erap 's son Jinggoy the vice-mayor of San Juan\n\n\nAnd I am also the  ninong  in marriage of Tito Guingona 's son \n\n Hence I felt I should select the Vice-Presidential nominee only after consultation with the executive committee of the Liberal Party\n\n\nThe assertion of my friend Erap that it is undemocratic for me to choose my running mate is therefore historically wrong\n\n\nAnd more than that it is repudiated by his own press statements\n\n\nI will just cite one\n\n\nIn the Philippine Inquirer issue of February twenty-three nineteen ninety-one Erap was quoted by Senate reporter Jenny Ilio in the following words Yes said Erap I 'm willing to forego my Presidential ambition if Senate President Salonga will get me as his Vice-Presidential teammate \n\n\nOtherwise Erap said I will leave the Liberal Party quote unquote\n\n\nIn other words what my friend Erap had wanted me to do that is choose him over  Tito Guingona as my teammate is precisely the very same thing he now considers undemocratic or dictatorial and which we in the Liberal Party did not follow anyway\n\n\nAt any rate on January eight nineteen ninety-one I invited Erap and Tito to my residence as I was bothered by the fact that their version of their understanding differed in some respects\n\n\nFor example Tito told me that they had agreed that whoever lost in the selection would be the campaign manager of the other\n\n\nErap denied this to me\n\n\nHence I prepared the draft of an agreement embodying their idea of vesting in me as Presidential nominee the prerogative of selecting my running mate in accordance with the election law and the Liberal Party practice but giving me enough latitude to consult the executive committee of the party\n\n\nWhat Erap did not like in that written agreement was the last paragraph\n\n\nIt said we solemnly promise to abide by the decision and work unconditionally for the victory of the Liberal Party \n\n\nIt was this paragraph that he did not like\n\n\nErap told me if you decide in favor of Tito this means  wala na akong pupuntahan  I have no more option \n\n\nIn fairness to Tito however he was prepared to sign that document\n\n\nErap brought that document with him and eventually showed it to some people who leaked it to the press with their very critical comments, \n\n\n Dito pala may  partial brownout  \n\n\n Pagka ang pinag-uusapan pala ay si Erap nagkakaroon ng  brownout  \n\n\n Parang may  shooting  tayong palagi dito  \n\n\nAs a result the L P Executive Committee which met several times, formulated what is now known as the three step process and adopted all the proposals of Senators Maceda and Estrada in the selection of our candidates, \n\n\nAlthough Erap has already apologized to me let me clarify the baselessness of his charge that I handpicked the members of the executive committee\n\n\nUnder the party constitution the great majority of the members of the executive committee are the national officials elected by the people\n\n\nThe former President of the Philippines Diosdado Macapagal is the titular head\n\n\nAll the eight L P senators, and all the nineteen members of Congress compose the majority of the executive committee members\n\n\nThey are not there because Salonga handpicked them\n\n\nThey are there because they were elected by the people\n\n\nEminent  legal  personalities such as former Justice Cecilia Mu&ntilde;oz-Palma President of the Con Com of which Vice-President Villacorta is a shining star   patay sila dun   and Chief Justice Pedro Yap who was abroad at the time of the meeting are in the executive committee because the L P constitution so provides\n\n\nThese are distinguished men and women known for their independent-mindedness their integrity and their competence\n\n\nHow can I possibly dictate to them\n\n\n Marahil at ito'y sinabi ko kay Erap hindi lamang nabasa ng mga  advisers  mo ang  party constitution  at ang  party rules\n\n\n Hindi mo kasalanan 'yan ang sabi ko kay Erap \n\n\n'Yan ay kasalanan ng mga tagapayo mo na hindi marunong magbasa  \n\n\nNow this brings me to the consistory or concrete method of voting which was followed last March eight at the meeting of the executive committee in the house of President Macapagal\n\n\nIncidentally, this is the method used by the Cardinals when they choose the Pope, \n\n\nIn the March eight meeting of the executive committee presided by President Macapagal there were no nominations, \n\n\nEveryone belonging to the party was a potential candidate\n\n\nThere were no speeches\n\n\nThe balloting was secret and there was no vote buying\n\n\nMoney politics under the new politics of the Liberal Party was completely eliminated\n\n\nBefore the balloting began at around nine in the morning we received a letter of resignation from Erap Estrada handcarried by Congressman Rivera of Bulacan\n\n\nThe letter stated that due to quote recent developments within the party unquote he arrived at the painful decision quote unquote to render his resignation effective immediately\n\n\nThis caught the executive committee by surprise\n\n\nA week ago on February twenty-six and a day before the meeting of the executive committee Erap had reassured our congressmen that he was coming to the executive committee meeting he was going to participate in the voting and he would abide by the results\n\n\nTherefore, that time and again Erap had threatened to bolt the Liberal Party if I did not choose him as Vice-Presidential teammate\n\n\nIn one breath he wanted me to exercise one-man rule but in the next breath he condemned the practice he had wanted as dictatorial or undemocratic", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "200c1194-6e22-4bf4-860f-2bd0977194c6", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.188599+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nI 'm sorry that I brought a uh laptop here\n\n\nIn the bank I am in charge of the audio-visual uhm treatment\n\n\nI was responsible for, bringing in the marketing touch for our presentations\n\n\nThat 's the reason why I can get away with this equipment without the bank knowing it\n\n\nAnyway when I told them that I was going to share the uh corporate vision of Union Bank with uh you La Sallites, they did not hesitate to allow me to, borrow the equipment\n\n\nIt 's sort of a uh selling also a selling tool to you La Sallites who would like to work later on with our bank\n\n\nSo much for the advertisement, \n\n\nSome of you know that I am an Atenean and you may wonder why what am I doing here\n\n\nI didn't realize that Max uh tricked me into this  'no  uh but it was from a great La Sallite by the name of Dr Bernardo Villegas, that I got to learn about business ethics\n\n\nYou may say that in Ateneo we uh are taught sixteen units of theology and sixteen units of philosophy more than our major uhm course, \n\n\nYou may think that us Ateneans would have more or less a lot of this social awareness or social consciousness\n\n\nIn fact the battle cry of Ateneo is \" man for others \" \n\n\nBut even with that I did not know how to face or I was not prepared when I started working, on how to judge whether what was good or what was bad\n\n\nIn Ateneo they taught you uh for as long as you 're serving others then you 're okay\n\n\nBut there 's this big question when like  myself when I started joining a corporation or working for a corporation we very well know that the  ano  and we were taught in business that, the end goal of business is profits\n\n\nSo I was not able to reconcile profits and social responsibility, \n\n\nBut it was uh when I studied at the Center for Research and Communication, when Dr Bernie Villegas taught about two principles in business ethics and these principles are called, the principle of solidarity and the principle of subsidiarity\n\n\nWhat is my laptop doing here\n\n\nWell, inside that laptop is two months of hard work, translating in visual terms what Union Bank 's vision is all about\n\n\nThis is my shared experience with you\n\n\nUh you 're one of the few and lucky, shall we say lucky viewers because this isn't shown to everybody\n\n\nRight now our bank is up for for sale at least thirty percent\n\n\nI am supposed to be there but uh since it was a previous commitment I 'm here\n\n\nIn any case I hope that you will uh seeing it a lot of uh values that I just mentioned about uh solidarity and subsidiarity\n\n\nBut I 'll tell you much  much more about this later on\n\n\nBut first, let 's talk about solidarity and subsidiarity, \n\n\nHow many of you here would say that business is based on greed, \n\n\nYou know I 've I went I 've gone through the mission statement of of uh La Salle and there is a lot of it there 's a lot of social responsibility there isn't it\n\n\nAnd uh there 's one thing that I observed also here that every six o'clock I dunno if also every twelve o'clock you say the Angelus\n\n\nThat 's very admirable, \n\n\nBut I think this group here is coming from the business economics, am I right, group\n\n\nAnd am I also right that you are here and you are taking your courses so that you would earn a living right\n\n\nHow many of you here would say that you are here uh for altruistic reasons,  ha  \n\n\nIsn't it that you would like to  crash in  your course and finish your course as soon as possible so that you can start working  hindi ba  and not only working but working in the best companies\n\n\nBecause do you know that it is only here in La Salle that I realized that you are already learning courses or subjects which, normally if you compare with other graduates they get to learn only in their masteral courses not even in their masteral courses but during actual work experience\n\n\nSo you 're very fortunate\n\n\nBut that all adds up to your trying to get the best in terms of income if you want to work for a corporation right you want to be employed  hindi ba  \n\n\nHow much how much are you expected to earn right now\n\n\nBefore one thousand was fine with us  'no  let 's just say five years ago  \n\n\nBut now I think the uh average hiring rate at least in commercial banks would range from three to five thousand pesos\n\n\nOkay let 's say let 's say that you know inflation is high and uh things have changed and you guys are more experts supposedly, \n\n\nBut can you reconcile well some of you here I know I have some students who are all who would also like to be entrepreneurs, but isn't also the end goal of a business, profit,  hindi ba  \n\n\nI can see some students here who would like who would one of these days would like to put up their own business and make money and become heroes, exporters, \n\n\nSo let 's, let 's say that you are here in La Salle studying working your your very best to get the best grades so that you can if you want to work for a corporation you can earn, the highest salaries possible\n\n\nOr if you become entrepreneurs, immediately join the big league in export business\n\n\nAll for what\n\n\nMoney  hindi ba  \n\n\nBut is money bad, \n\n\nHow many of you say that uh how many of you here think that money is evil  \n\n\nOtherwise you all shift courses to what and you will become priests and nuns  'no , \n\n\nBut money  per se  is not bad just like business just like earning a career, earning a living, \n\n\nWhat is bad is the abuse of money\n\n\nOr what is bad is the abuse of business,  di ba  , \n\n\nLet me quote George  Guildern  \n\n\nHe is a noted uhm American  uh, socio  anthropologist\n\n\nHe says that Christianity preaches that it is better to give than to receive but in business it is better to receive your profits  hindi ba , \n\n\nNow he also says that the Church condemns the abuses of capitalism but not private initiative\n\n\nAnd that 's the core of, business\n\n\nAnd that 's the core of, that 's the core of you working for corporations, private initiative, \n\n\nAnd he goes on further to say, that, enterprises are essentially altruistic \n\n\nHard to believe  'no  \n\n\nSo it is other-oriented not a zero-sum game when a gain for one player can only come at the expense of another, \n\n\nHard to believe again  'no  \n\n\nBut I think knowing I mean knowing uh La Salle for two semesters, uh they also bombard you with a lot of social responsibility\n\n\nBut let me share with you these two principles which can help us uh make judgments when we 're working either for a corporation or when we put up our own business\n\n\nAnd these once more are the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, \n\n\n well subsidiarity is essentially, human right\n\n\nIt is part of, a basic human right for one to earn his living, okay and make money in the process because if we think of it some of you here who have more or less uh some background on theology or religion isn't it that we are primarily responsible first to our Creator,  di ba  \n\n\nNext to ourselves, then others\n\n\nBecause how can you help others if you cannot even help yourselves\n\n\nAnd how can you help yourself if you 're not you don't even know that you have a Creator to serve first, \n\n\nSo it is okay so it 's okay that you 're studying what business economics so that you 'll earn money\n\n\nBut I 'm sure some of you are doing this what primarily for, your loved ones\n\n\nSome of you would have families later on and you 'll do this what for your families but not for yourself\n\n\nThen it becomes altruistic\n\n\nThen the principle of subsidiarity which is basically private enterprise or self-interest, becomes a noble thing\n\n\nBut there 's a problem\n\n\nIf all of you would start getting interested primarily for  for his or her own concerns there might be some trouble,  di ba  \n\n\nBecause who can tell you or who can tell the other that once I start doing my thing it might be at the expense of the other\n\n\nSo there 's a need for order, social justice, and the order of law\n\n\nAnd  this is where the principle of solidarity comes in\n\n\nJust simply common good  'no  \n\n\nUhm, let me give you an example\n\n\nThe government has no business running, small enterprises which can produce goods and services more efficiently\n\n\nThis is the reason why Mr Gorbachev went through  perestroika  and  glasnost  \n\n\nThis is why China has started to move into market, capitalism\n\n\nWhy because they 've realized that you guys who would be businessmen later on or working for businesses can produce goods and services more efficiently than the government\n\n\nBut on the other hand, you have no business building roads building bridges public uhm, utilities\n\n\nIt 's not profitable  di ba  \n\n\nAnd this is where the principle of solidarity comes in wherein the common good is at stake then the government has to come in\n\n\nThen private individuals like you and me have to bond together and work for this common good\n\n\nI hope I have shared it with you as as well as lay-mannish as possible, \n\n\nNow the dangers to avoid, are the of course anything the dangers to avoid are extremes, and one extreme is liberalism\n\n\nWell in in liberalism uh the individual is glorified\n\n\nOkay this is where we have the rightists  'no , and uh they sometimes do their thing at the expense of the common good\n\n\nNow we have what the uh military rightists right now threatening the country\n\n\nFor as long as they pursue their cause even at the expense of what investments that could have gone to the country and gone to productive purposes,  bahala na kung wala 'yon basta 'yung masusunod 'yung gusto namin  \n\n\n Mapapalitan si 'yung  present administration and they would come in and uh claim to put order into the government\n\n\nOn the other hand what do we have\n\n\nThe other extreme, leftists\n\n\nUhm they 're technically called socialists  hindi ba  \n\n\nWhere the collective is glorified at the expense of what, the individual or individual freedom\n\n\nAnd so we 're left with no choice, but to strike that happy balance between the two extremes wherein going out making business and making money for altruistic purposes or working for companies and getting as much salary as you can, can be justified\n\n\nAnd in fact I encourage you to even get more because the country needs more\n\n\nI told some of my students that graduating after graduating they 'd better work in Hong Kong uh Thailand Malaysia, Singapore South Korea all of these newly-industrialized countries or tiger economies\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nIt may be for altruistic reason\n\n\nThey can get more in terms of money and in terms of experience, and of course that money would not go to Swiss accounts like somebody else did\n\n\nBecause if that money were circulated within the system then even if uh no matter how greedy that person can become that money would benefit a lot of people especially those in the financial sector, \n\n\nDon't you think so\n\n\nBut it was pulled outside of the country so who  benefited from it, the Swiss, \n\n\nSo if you guys work outside for say five years while you are young 'cause each year I understand that the age limit is getting younger and younger\n\n\nYou have what five years is easy to spare,  hindi ba  \n\n\nGain that experience \n\n against a local here in terms of experience you 're ahead\n\n\nBut I 'm sure that money that you will be earning and that experience you will be earning will be brought back here\n\n\nThe P L D T commercial  babalik ka rin, di ba  \n\n\nThat 's why they 're called heroes right now the new heroes those who are bringing in the dollars, \n\n\nSo, I 'd like now to share with you uhm an example of uh our vision\n\n\nI work for Union Bank of the Philippines\n\n\nIt is a uh government-owned bank and I 'm very happy to inform you that we underwent a visioning process and it was in this process that we were able to find out that our stockholders were not greedy at all okay\n\n\nThey of course they demanded the best returns on their investments\n\n\nThey also were able to open their eyes to the needs of employees and others\n\n\nAnd we also realized that we not only have to concern ourselves with our employers but we also realized that we had a responsibility to share or we were responsible not only to our stockholders but also to other stakeholders\n\n\nSo this is another uh principle which I 'd like to share with you \n\n It 's the concept of the stakeholder concept wherein which guarantees that if you uhm take care of all of those guys who are part of your business be it a janitor your supplier, your buyers, management employees even the community the nation then if you take care of them pretty well not only managing your own business but also your relationship with them then you can be guaranteed of success in your business endeavors\n\n\nSo so much for the theory\n\n\nLet 's move into the into uh an actual output of our bank, \n\n \n\n\nOkay uhm this is uh supposed to be space  , \n\n\nNow the background here is that our stockholders the Aboitiz Group S S S who owns sixty percent Aboitiz owns forty percent together with uh top management meaning department heads and some middle managers uh got got together and decided to find out what do we really want to be in the next ten years okay\n\n\nAnd so and and the process was such that uhm let me pause for a while  ha kasi baka naunahan na kayo  \n\n\nThe process was such that uhm we were supposed to come up with drawings  'no  literally a literal vision of what they expect the bank to be ten years from now\n\n\nSurprisingly uhm they found out that, the owners the employees and management came up with more or less the same picture and this was really hair-raising because we didn't expect it to be that way", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nAs I was saying uh in Ayala we have been very fortunate to have had uh one of the, not graduate soon-to-graduate uh uh from  Ley   from uh Legal Management one of your very own Rowena Tan who was assigned to us as a student trainee and we are very happy to have her with us and in the  process uh we got to know uh people like Imelda Lim, Juna Mae de Leon and a couple of others\n\n\nSo it 's good to know that the relationship continues uh beyond uh being a student trainee and coming over to your school to be able to share with you uh our own thoughts\n\n\nOkay uh some of you have class uh after this so we 'll go ahead with our presentation,  \n\n\nWhat makes Ayala click or what makes Ayala tick as uh the dean was telling me\n\n\nWell uh I 'll walk you through just to give you an idea it 's one fifteen I want to do some good time management here\n\n\nSo what I want to talk about is uh the basic fundamental beliefs that uh make Ayala what it is today and focusing on three principal areas which I will not preempt but talk about a little bit later on\n\n\nAnd then go through those three areas and then later on do some summarization and then close it and open the floor to questions if we have time\n\n\nAnd so if some of you need to leave the room Nike and Jimmy was apprising me please don't feel embarrassed uh that 's fine\n\n\nIf you have to leave leave and then those who want to stay by all means stay\n\n\nI will be happy to answer as many questions as you want\n\n\nUh I asked for leave for the balance of the afternoon so that will justify my presence for the rest of the afternoon here at uh De La Salle\n\n\nSo let 's talk about Ayala and what makes Ayala tick, \n\n\nAyala is really, a holding company and a holding company is a company that is in the business of managing several companies\n\n\nSo the holding company is Ayala, the employee force is a hundred and eighty-nine not too many\n\n\nBut when we are talking about the whole conglomerate we are talking roughly of an employee population of forty thousand\n\n\nSo not not big if you compare say to the San Miguel 's or what have you which is very much manufacturing labor-intensive\n\n\nSo when we talk \" Ayala \" this afternoon we 're talking about the philosophy the rationale the thinking of the holding company and how it concretizes itself in several diverse businesses that it is involved in\n\n\nHere I flash the logos of several of those companies not not complete\n\n\nBut for example Purefoods which is the flagship of our food manufacturing enterprise, the most recent company called Ayala Land which we shall make reference to later on, Ayala Life Insurance Company which is the flagship company of our insurance business, \n\n\nThen we have Integrated Micro-Electronics Incorporated which is involved in the semicon industry and the like\n\n\nAnd then we have the bank through the unibank the Bank of the Philippine Islands\n\n\nAnd then we have the Ayala Foundation\n\n\nYou may be wondering what a foundation is doing uh in uh a conglomerate\n\n\nWe shall explain that a little bit later on\n\n\nAnd then we have a presence in the agricultural side through Ayala Agri\n\n\nSo we 're talking about Ayala and its philosophy concretized through the conglomerate, \n\n\nI hope you can read that uh it might be a bit blurred there for the gentlemen at the back so I will read it out loud\n\n\nI quote directly from a statement of the person whom we fondly call in the organization \" J Z A \" \n\n\nJ Z A represents the initials of Jaime Zobel or  he would say if you wanted to impress him Thobel Tho the Spanish \" th \" the Jaime Thobel Jaime Thobel de Ayala whom we fondly call J Z A by initials\n\n\nAnd I quote uh what does he say\n\n\nHe says in an environment of constant change which I 'm sure you 're familiar with you hear it from your professors  etcetera  both domestically and internationally it is critically important for Ayala to be a flexible institution in the long term\n\n\nFlexibility and the ability to adjust quickly to changing circumstances are very important to long-term success \n\n\nSo I just want to highlight that in terms of the question what makes Ayala click what makes Ayala tick \n\n\nWell precisely because it wants to respond to an environment of constant change not only in the local scene but internationally as well\n\n\nAnd it strives to stress flexibility and the ability to adjust quickly, \n\n\nAnd here I 'd like to share with you a problem and the problem is Ayala Corporation is one hundred fifty-eight years old\n\n\nAnd when your uh group that is that old and you talk about flexibility how do you build in flexibility into your organization knowing that you do have to respond to the changing times to the various scenarios available, \n\n\nIn this light,  we would like to focus on three areas which the company believes are critical components or major publics to be addressed as it focuses on change flexibility in the long term environment\n\n\nWhat are the three\n\n\nThe first are the stockholders  ang mga nagpupundar sa kumpanya  in the parlance of the Marxists  ang mga kapitalista  uh the employees  mga kawani natin  and the nation\n\n\nSo we 're looking at three critical constituents or major publics and this is critical\n\n\nI think this is precisely why Ayala is what it is today because it tries to balance the interest of stockholders employees and that of the nation\n\n\n\" Balance \" mind you that word is carefully chosen\n\n\nBecause sometimes if you 're an owner you want so much in terms of profitability\n\n\nAnd if you talk about profitability in the context of the Mideast War right now you can see the potential profitability of being into the armament business\n\n\nImagine if you were manufacturing a \" Patriot \" or a \" patriotic missile \" you 'd be earning something like one million dollars a day just for one missile and so many missiles  etcetera  plus all the equipment that goes into it\n\n\nSo if you 're just thinking of profitability why the arms business brings in tremendous profits\n\n\nBut is that the type of business that you want to get yourself into\n\n\nI just throw that there or, in some M B A classes they show that there are certain types of businesses that give you a big return on investment but you question again what type of service does that investment offer\n\n\nSo we 're looking at three critical components or publics the stockholders the employees and the nation, \n\n\nLet 's look at the stockholders, \n\n\nThose of you who are interested in the financial side you might be interested to know that Ayala has five thousand six hundred stockholders\n\n\nEmployees uh the Armed Forces of the Philippines have invested some of their retirement funds in this uh all kinds of people\n\n\nI 'm proud to say that I myself am a stockholder\n\n\nSeveral years back through salary deduction they allowed me to buy into the company and even while I was paying for those shares through salary deduction I was already enjoying the cash dividends and the stock dividends that uh fully-paid stockholders enjoyed\n\n\nIn fact uh just to share further when I was putting up my house through a housing loan with the company and I needed extra funds I liquefied some of these shares to be able to add to the construction of the house and until now I still have some of those shares\n\n\n Ika nga sabi nila nanganak na nang nanganak na 'yung  share  na 'yon  \n\n\nAnd my concept is I 'd like to be able to hold on to  those shares and leave a legacy to my family and say you know when you 're old enough hopefully those shares have grown and you have a share or several shares in Ayala \n\n\nSo we 're talking about five thousand six hundred stockholders\n\n\nIn nineteen seventy-six a share was valued at four pesos and twenty per share\n\n\n\" Today today \"  is nineteen ninety because the study was done last year\n\n\nNineteen ninety including the dividends and the stocks that you would have gained is something like two hundred eighteen pesos and fifty-two centavos per share\n\n\nSo do your mathematics the growth of that share\n\n\nPeople in the stock market analyze things like  uh price and earnings ratio that sort of thing\n\n\nIt grew by an average of thirty-two percent per year and if you factor in the the good times and the hard times because as you well know uh since seventy-six we have had the good times and we have also had the lean times\n\n\nProfitability rose by twenty-six point two percent on the average and what is the key\n\n\nThe key is to be a diversified and balanced portfolio of businesses\n\n\nI can be more concrete here\n\n\nI used to be assigned as the Personnel Manager for Purefoods Corporation\n\n\nAnd at that time the only line that Purefoods was in was in the what we refer to as fresh processed meats  'yung hamon  hotdog  delata  \n\n\nAnd we asked ourselves with all the competition going around you uh couldn't rely on one area merely to be able to carry your business\n\n\nSo within Purefoods they were already talking about chicken poultry and uh considering that the lead market leaders for poultry anybody know who 's the market leader for chicken nowadays\n\n\nMagnolia Magnolia 's number one uhm Purefoods is number four\n\n\nConsidering that it is a late starter in the ballgame to be up there in the big league is to achieve no mean achievement 'cause we came into the ballgame in nineteen eighty-four\n\n\nBut you see what happened in the the times when  delata  or fresh processed meats were down  me sumasalo at ang sumalo dito  was chicken business\n\n\nAnd then in the Purefoods we further diversified our export market\n\n\nWe shall talk about that a little bit later on not to preempt that to be able to balance off and diversify the portfolio, \n\n\nTalking about one critical component, what makes Ayala tick the stockholders their confidence in what we are doing the businesses that we are in\n\n\nThe second critical component are the employees\n\n\nNow all of us are familiar with annual reports and they say uh that the single largest asset of the company is not the money it 's the people\n\n\nAnd you will hear that often said and Ayala is uh not alone in that\n\n\nWe also believe that a critical public to address in terms of uh being critical to success are our employees\n\n\nWe are concerned for the quality of life both work and personal life of almost thirty thousand nine hundred thirty-seven work force\n\n\nOur statistics show that on the average uh you multiply that by five the average size of a family generally speaking is five\n\n\nSo you multiply that by five and you can say that is the reach of the Ayala Group of Companies and if you wish to add the extended ties of families perhaps that will go up a little bit more\n\n\nWe follow a holistic approach to our human resources\n\n\nThat sounds like jargon sounds like uh a technical term\n\n\nWhat is what is meant by a holistic approach\n\n\nHolistic approach simply means thaat we look at the total person we look at the environment likewise in which the employee is at\n\n\nSo we don't only focus on compensation on on salaries we also look at uh things like psychic income\n\n\nNone of you have heard that term \" psychic income \" \n\n\nIt 's good to have pesos to hold in your hand and you can spend it\n\n\nBut it 's also good to know that you are recognized for your talents for your abilities\n\n\nIt 's good to know that uh the company gives you authority to do certain things and that gives you a feeling of uh self-esteem a feeling of importance a feeling that you are valuable to the organization\n\n\nThat 's the type of thrust that we have and we do that to things like uh  jumping down a little bit \" training and development \" \n\n\nWe train our supervisors to be able to motivate our employees not only through things like increases that sort of thing but also to be able to turn them on to be able to show that they can contribute and give value to the organization\n\n\nWe honestly say that we are not the top payer  kung gusto mo ang pinakamalaking suweldo puntahan mo mga  multinationals\n\n\n Pero ang  multinationals from my experience they really squeeze you dry\n\n\nAfter a time they will tell you okay I think it 's time that we get another uh group of fresh blood into the organization \n\n\nSo what do they do\n\n\nThey dangle very nice uh separation packages which is very attractive some become millionaires overnight\n\n\nSo what do some of these people do\n\n\nThey leave they become entrepreneurs or they start looking for jobs again\n\n\nAyala 's philosophy is a bit different\n\n\nWe believe that our compensation is above industry average but we also go beyond the legal requirements and the C B A\n\n\nUh C B A here refers to the Collective Bargaining Agreement\n\n\nUh we are in a unionized environment and uh as pointed out a little bit later on over twenty-seven years relationship with the union there has been no single day of work stoppage for the last twenty-seven years\n\n\nI think that 's uh something to boast about in terms of the type of relationship we have with our uh friends in labor\n\n\nFamily needs are are also addressed\n\n\nSeventy percent of our employees own their own house\n\n\nSome of them live in Ayala Alabang and if they were to liquefy their own investment in that I mean we 're talking millionaires since Dindo Pumaren Al Solis millionaires they could be millionaires in their own right because of the advantages that the company has made available to them", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nI apologize most abjectly for coming late\n\n\nIt was I assure you uh something that I could not control 'cause of the hearing uh in in the Senate\n\n\nAnyway uh we are here today as students of Economics and as interested citizens interested especially in how the economy is performing and I would like to tell you that my talk is going to be in the following manner\n\n\nFirst I 'm going to say what I think the potential of the economy is\n\n\nSecond I 'm going to say how the economy is being poisoned\n\n\nAnd third I 'm going to say how we can remove the poison from the economy so that we can get back the economy on a sustained growth path which is the objective that is most desired by everyone, \n\n\nSo my first statement is, the potential of the economy\n\n\nI can stand here and unambiguously say that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the economy and the potential of the Philippines that a dose of good old, economic policy proper economic policy can, uh, will be able to attain\n\n\nWhat do I mean by that\n\n\nIf you look around at all our neighbors you will find out especially the ASEAN you will find out that the Philippines in nineteen sixty was second only to Japan as far as its economic development was concerned as far as position in the economic in the developing economies of the world was concerned\n\n\nThat position has deteriorated steadily since then\n\n\nSo that although in nineteen sixty we could be compared favorably with Thailand by the time we reached nineteen eighty-nine economists from abroad had already said that it was not fair to compare the Philippines and Thailand any longer\n\n\nThailand is just too much out of our league\n\n\nThat hurts\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause as far as the resources of the Philippines are concerned as far as the human resources especially the natural resources name it we 've got what it takes\n\n\nSo the next question that can be asked is where did we go wrong\n\n\nWe went wrong simply because always economic policy and good economics has taken second place third place and fourth place to every other particular perspective of concern of the Filipino people\n\n\nThis has got to change\n\n\nAnd I think it is changing because where before economics if there was a lecture on economics we would have maybe two three four people uh coming in\n\n\nNow everyone is interested to find out what in heaven 's name is wrong about our wrong with our economy and what can be done about it, \n\n\nThe prospects the immediate prospects for the Philippines are very gloomy\n\n\nBut that does not that should not give us any cause for depression or for a or for giving us the the incentive to crawl into a hole and die\n\n\nThat should rather elicit in us the response that we are fighting mad we are going to do something about it\n\n\nIf we can't do something about it right now where by God by the time we get to be responsible citizens and in positions of power we 're going to do  something about it then \n\n There is always hope while there is life\n\n\nThe question only  is must we have so much more problems to resolve in the future as a result of the compounding of the  of the problems of the present and the past\n\n\nWhy do I say that the prospects are gloomy\n\n\nWell if you will notice or if you have read in the newspapers the text of the memorandum of economic policy which contains the stabilization program that the Philippine government has submitted to the I M F for approval you will find out that while the targets, there are so many specific targets with respect to revenue with respect to expenditures  etcetera etcetera  very little mention is made about what the growth prospects of the economy are\n\n\nIn fact in the text of the memorandum of economic policy you will find out that they all all they say is that for nineteen ninety-one the growth of G N P will be quote slow unquote\n\n\nWhat \" slow \" means I don't know\n\n\nI just attended a hearing this morning where they said well about one and a half percent one and a half to two percent \n\n\nThe question is is that good bad or indifferent\n\n\nI was just in Thailand last week or two weeks ago and a Thai economist very good economist who also happens to be one of the leading economic managers in Thailand was pulling my leg when he said when he said in answer to my question what 's the growth prospect of Thailand this year \n\n\nAnd he said very bad very bad \n\n\nWe 're only going to grow by six and a half percent  \n\n\nThat hurts especially since because at the beginning of the term of President Aquino the government had put forward an economic plan that targeted a growth rate of six and a half percent on the average for the medium term\n\n\nEverybody at that time said that was too ambitious\n\n\nAnd I said no that is just absolutely mediocre because that was going to be the growth rate of the rest of Asia on the average for the medium term 's eighty-seven eighty-seven to ninety-two \n\n\nNow not only are we not talking about the six and a half percent we 're not even giving a numerical magnitude to it\n\n\nOne and a half percent was taken out of the out of the as a as a grudging admission on the part of our economic managers because one and a half percent growth rate of G D P will mean that on a  per capita  basis we will have contracted by negative one percent\n\n\nAnd even that ladies and gentlemen of the audience seems to be an overestimate given a close study of what exactly the features are the other features are of this memorandum of economic policy for this economic stabilization program\n\n\nNow as students of economics for example just as a \" for example \" to to show you why I think that one and a half percent may be too much of an overestimate given the specific measures that are in this memorandum of economic policy\n\n\nThere is a relationship economic relationship between for example the money supply and G N P\n\n\nM is equal to P Q for all those who have forgotten\n\n\nIn other words the growth of money the rate the growth rate of money is equal to the growth rate if you talk talk about it in logarithmic terms is equal to the inflation rate plus the real growth rate of the economy\n\n\nWell, what do we have in terms of the targeted increase in money supply\n\n\nThis has not been published and I don't know why but the growth rate in money supply according to confidential sources and I sincerely hope I am wrong the growth rate of money supply in terms of base money has been stated as a ceiling by the I M F agreed to by the Philippines or  vice versa  whichever way you want to it 's the same at ten point eight seven percent for nineteen ninety-one\n\n\n Gawin na nating  eleven  puwede ba  \n\n\nI mean this specificity up to the second decimal point really awes me especially since they ignore completely what the growth target is for the economy as a whole\n\n\nSo that 's eleven percent that 's the growth rate of base money\n\n\nInflation is really projected to be about fourteen to fifteen percent this year\n\n\nSo if growth rate of money supply is equal to inflation rate plus the growth rate of G N P that means that G N P more or less will contract by three to four percent this year\n\n\nHow they came up with that one and a half percent is beyond me\n\n\nIt must either be because they have made the wrong assumptions with respect to inflation or they actually think that the Filipino people will sit will take this sitting down\n\n\nI certainly hope that we don't\n\n\nBut until and unless we see the entire memorandum of economic policy not just the text but the tables and the accompanying appendices we are not going to be able to make a judgement\n\n\nBut one thing sure even at the present uh even given all consistency one and a half percent should never be acceptable\n\n\nIf that is what we mean by stability then my only answer to that is what is good about stability if being stable means being dead\n\n\nDeath after all is a stable condition\n\n\nIt 's about the most stable condition of all <unclear> words </unclear> and that we do not want, \n\n\nWhy is it that we are accepting these kind of measures  \n\n\nWell so what how do I know what are these measures all about\n\n\nThese measures essentially say you 've got to decrease your deficit the public sector deficit and by the way you 've got to decrease your national government deficit\n\n\nYou also and in order to do this you are going to have to increase your revenues and or decrease your expenditures or both \n\n\nWe are doing both\n\n\nExactly how much are we supposed to decrease our public sector deficit\n\n\nIt is supposed to go down from what it was last year five point two percent of G N P to supposedly nineteen ninety notice how specific they are to three point seven percent of G N P that 's the public sector that includes the national government the local governments the government corporations the government financial corporations the Central Bank  etcetera  \n\n\nSo you must decrease it by essentially one and a half percentage points of G N P\n\n\nBut they say that the national government which is part and parcel of this public sector deficit must decrease this deficit by two percentage points of G N P\n\n\nIn other words the entire burden of the deficit reduction is must be borne by the national government to the extent by the way of even more than the reduction of the deficit of the public sector\n\n\nIn other words they 're expecting that the public sector deficit the rest of the public sector deficit will increase but that 's all right the national government is going to bear the brunt\n\n\nWell folks the national government means you and me because we are talking about taxes from the taxpayers I I mean revenues which are going to be paid by you and me and expenditures on the people that are supposed to be spent on you and me\n\n\nSo the first thing that can be said about this memorandum of economic policy about this particular measure is  sobra naman ang kanilang pagkahigpit  \n\n\nWhy do I say that\n\n\nBecause as far as comparisons with other countries are concerned the really the government deficit the national government deficit is less than the average deficit of countries of a comparable size comparable income comparable debt structure  etcetera  \n\n\nWe have actually less\n\n\nWhy we did not fight for a uh for a more uh for a less contractionary policy is something again that is beyond me\n\n\nBecause Mexico in nineteen eighty-six was given an I M F program with a deficit of G N P of the national government of Mexico of more than fifteen percent\n\n\n Binigyan pa sila  \n\n\n E tayo e  we are being asked to decrease our deficit from three point eight percent of G N P National Government to one point eight percent of G N P and you say well so what \n\n\nThat 's two percentage points\n\n\nLet me tell you how that deficit is going to be decreased\n\n\nThere are ways and ways of decreasing deficits\n\n\nOne by increasing revenues and the other by decreasing expenditures\n\n\nBut even in increasing revenues there are ways and ways of increasing it and in decreasing expenditures also\n\n\nThe problem is we are increasing revenues the wrong way and we are decreasing expenditures the wrong way\n\n\nWrong in the sense that it is going to be down or be inimical to not only the development targets of the Philippines in the short term which is this year but also in the medium and long term\n\n\nWhy do I say it 's the wrong way\n\n\nRevenues, they say uh you 've got to increase your revenues\n\n\nTherefore until and unless Congress passes all these alternative measures you have got to  introduce  or to impose an import levy of nine percent \n\n\nFolks a nine percent import levy is essentially a sales tax it is an indirect tax\n\n\nWe have been fighting since nineteen eighty-six to try to reform the tax structure of the Philippine economy so that it is less regressive and more progressive\n\n\nWe do not like the regressivity of the tax structure because it is more burdensome to the poor\n\n\nSo we have been fighting since nineteen eighty-six to increase this  uh a this progressivity of the tax structure and in one fell swoop we are bringing it back to what it was in nineteen eighty-six\n\n\nIt is as if all our efforts at reforming a uh a tax structure at implementing it very much needed structural change in the economy which is to increase the equity of the economy has just been completely neutralized by this one revenue measure", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThank you very much for your very kind uh introduction Mr Enrico Villanueva incoming President of uh this very prestigious student organization   \n\n\nThat introduction I 'm happy to note did not sound like a campaign speech  \n\n\nMay I address uh your respected dean Dean Lydia Echauz and also Dean Edralin as well as uh all the other members of the faculty\n\n\nAnd I also greet uh Nike Mora who wrote me the letter that will be today 's forum today\n\n\nAnd uh also to thank the entire administration of the De La Salle University, I say this because for the last uh eleven years I have been supporting this fora here in the De La Salle University, \n\n\nMy daughter is graduating from high school, at Alabang\n\n\nAnd by the way Margie my daughter I don't know if she 's around here I told her to sneak in even if she 's uh only a high school student\n\n\n Nandiyan ka ba Margie  <0> laughter </0> \n\n\nUh she was asking me to do her a favor\n\n\n Sabi niya Papa pakisilip mo naman yung  results  ng  examination  ko    talagang gusto kong pumasok uli sa  La Salle for uh college \n\n\nAnyway ladies and gentlemen, I was asked to speak on the subject of insurgency and I am fully prepared to do that for the next one hour and a half with all of these materials that were brought by my assistants in uh two suitcases  \n\n\nBut uh perhaps since insurgency is uh really one of the many manifestations of uh basic conditions that exist in our country today you might want me to talk about other matters pertaining to, other threats to our security situation\n\n\nThat includes not only the communist insurgents but also the Muslim secessionists in the south and also, the military rebels\n\n\nSome of  some of whom uh you may know or maybe your friends, uh no reaction <unclear> 3 words </unclear>  \n\n\nAs well as maybe the Gulf War and its implications on the Philippine situation\n\n\nBut anyway uh whatever be the subject you might want me to branch into later on let 's bring that out in the open forum\n\n\nBut on the insurgency\n\n\nFirst of all let us look at the our government structure to cope with the basic problems of Philippine society\n\n\nI think if we can start from that since uh as I understand this group is very socially conscious and that one of your uh mandatory subjects is a social outreach program\n\n\nUh let me just show you that uh our Philippine government now under the Aquino administration uh surely because of lessons learned from the EDSA People 's Revolution of nineteen eighty-six has seen to it that we attend to the basic causes that have led to various problems and difficulties in our country\n\n\nSo uh, Alex would you kindly show the  flow   chart\n\n\nSo very quickly let me just say that uh as identified by most uh social and political scientists that the basic problems of our country arise from the poverty of a great number of our people\n\n\nAlso ignorance ignorance not only in terms of the lack of education but also the lack of communications coming from the authorities to the masses of the people to inform the citizenry of what 's going on in the country\n\n\nInjustice of course which has many forms\n\n\nFear and apathy arising precisely out of insurgency and uh criminality and secession and even rebellion\n\n\nGraft and corruption, the favorite subject of uh Miriam Santiago Defensor as well as also my favorite subject together with many others\n\n\nAnd uh we have recently added overpopulation with no offense meant to anybody especially here in the De La Salle University\n\n\nBut uh as you can see poverty appears there as the biggest of them all\n\n\nEstimates show that uh about fifty to fifty-five percent of the Filipino people now, in early nineteen ninety-one fall below what is known as the poverty line\n\n\nAnd this is reflected in many many physical manifestations out there in the streets but also in many other ways which are not readily visible to the ordinary observer such as the poor health of our children\n\n\nThe uh lack of opportunity and social mobility on the part of uh many of our youth as well as also the uh unemployment and underemployment of many of our people\n\n\nAnyway to attend to these problems our government has devised a uh two track system\n\n\nThe two tracks of the railroad as we say which would lead to a better future, for the Filipinos especially the young Filipinos\n\n\nAnd these are the twin tracks of economic development and peace and order and security, \n\n\nNow let me explain this chart which shows the inter-agency linkages in government as well as with the private sector to achieve socio-political economic reforms and goals\n\n\nAll of which are to be protected by the military and the law enforcement authorities throughout the entire process of reform and change\n\n\nUh first of all uh with the President at the very top there, there is the socio-economic development side which is the which are the red blocks\n\n\nAt the national level of course there 's the President\n\n\nShe 's the chairman of the National Economic Development Authority or NEDA\n\n\nThen down below we have the regions\n\n\nThere are fourteen regions in this country twelve numbered regions and then the National Capital Region which is Metro Manila and the Cordillera, Administrative Region which is out there in the mountains on the North\n\n\nNow at the regional level we have a regional development council which attends to the coordination of uh the various programs of the various line agencies in government\n\n\nAnd this means Public Works Health DECS Transportation Communication uh  etcetera  \n\n\nNow each regional development council is advised by what they call a regional development assembly which is uh the body that consists of the elected officials in the region senators congressmen and representatives of the uh most respected non-government organizations\n\n\nSo as you can see right away the people represented by N G O 's are represented\n\n\nNow at the provincial level we have the P D C chaired by the governor\n\n\nAnd then down at the city and municipal levels the city extra-development council headed by their mayors\n\n\nAnd on down to the  barangay  and then to the people, hitting and working against these basic conditions of Philippine society that have given rise to our various problems be they social economic political or military\n\n\nNow on the other side we have the security and the peace and order council system\n\n\nAgain the President heads this in her capacity as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces as well as of all other armed forces in the country meaning the Philippine National Police\n\n\nAt the national level there is the national chairman which is who is the Secretary of the Department of the Interior and Local Government Secretary Luis T Santos and uh yours truly is the national vice-chairman\n\n\nNow there 's also a regional, peace and order council headed by either a regional director or a provincial governor who is elected by his peers at the region\n\n\nThen more importantly again a provincial council headed by the same governor of that province who is also the chairman of the development side\n\n\nAnd then again the city and  concerned  mayors down to the  barangays  to the people again hitting these basic problems\n\n\nNow facilitating these two tracks of the railroad harmonizing them coordinating them is the so called CORD system CORD meaning Cabinet Officer for Regional Development  \n\n\nI am the CORD for Region Nine I don't know whether any of you know where Region Nine is uh there is an Ateneo university there in Region Nine but no De La Salle  \n\n\nUh this is in Zamboanga and uh there are five provinces in that region, Zamboanga del Sur Zamboanga del Norte Basilan Sulu and Tawi-Tawi\n\n\nIt 's probably the most difficult region to work in because you have there the secessionist movement you have the C P P N P A then you have the problem of just being so far away from the center of action which is Manila\n\n\nAnyway you might wonder where you belong in this entire set-up\n\n\nWell you as young citizens from the private sector are in in are in all of these levels\n\n\nYou are either, yourself a member of the community in the  barangay  where you live whether it be a  barangay  in Las Pi&ntilde;as or Alabang or uh here in uh Manila itself\n\n\nOr as someone represented by any of the non-government organizations that have memberships in all of these various components and elements of our government system to uh attend to these problems\n\n\nAnd so uh I thought that it is important for me to show that you are right here\n\n\nYou are in the people portion\n\n\nYou are in the  barangay  portion\n\n\nYou are in the city and municipal levels as concerned citizens\n\n\nAnd uh surely as students of our social and economic milieu in the Philippines in nineteen ninety-one you must constantly inquire into how is it in your community how is it in your neighborhood how is it in your municipality how 's my mayor doing, because what I shall tell you later on are some of the things that they are expected to do so that we shall have a better condition of security and development in our country\n\n\nNow uh may I just show you also by way of backgrounder our national defense system in the country\n\n\nThere are three levels here\n\n\nThe biggest one which is the basic and to me the most important layer is what we call the civilian volunteer organizations or  Bantay Bayan  \n\n\nThis has many names  Barangay Tanod Bantay Bayan Nakasaka  C B O Neighborhood Association  etcetera  \n\n\nAnd then uh let me go back to that later on\n\n\nAnd then we have the so-called territorial forces\n\n\nThese are elements that are found in all of our towns and cities\n\n\nThat 's why they 're called \" territorial \" \n\n\nAnd these are mainly the Police and what we call the CAFGU or the uh units of the reserve force of the Armed Forces that are on duty to provide protection of their respective neighborhoods\n\n\nAnd then uh thirdly the mobile forces of the Armed Forces of the Philippines with brigades battalions uh naval uh patrol <unclear> 1 word </unclear> of uh helicopters and fighter planes\n\n\nThose of you who are in the R O T C or C M T are familiar with uh these units that we call the mobile forces\n\n\nNow the uh civilian volunteer organizations are unarmed\n\n\nThey are not really expected to fight as combatants but they do provide services that are important to the safety and the security of the community such as, information services information about strange happenings or strange people or strange uh movements in the community\n\n\nAnd uh also they provide emergency services medical fire-fighting uh  etcetera  \n\n\nNow you will note that they are surrounded by the people\n\n\nWithout that sea of people around them none of these elements will be effective at all\n\n\nYou 'll also note that these three elements are interlocking and overlapping and that 's because, they do overlap in their functions but more importantly they are interlocked as a, integral chain of defense for our safety and security\n\n\nNow, the uh system operates in a certain manner which is what we call the four steps method or the four step operational strategy in the field\n\n\nUh suppose there is a  barangay  let 's say here in Laguna near the mountains that is still affected by the insurgents or by the communist ideology and there are armed elements therein \n\n What happens insofar as government actions are concerned\n\n\nFirst of all there must be a clearing phase\n\n\n Dapat e labanan natin kaagad yung mga,  N P A who are armed so that they can be ejected from that  barangay  \n\n\nThis is the clearing phase and here we use our most capable units our mobile forces battalions uh strike companies  etcetera  \n\n\nAnd after the clearing has been done the same  barangay  must be held and protected so that the uh armed enemy does not come back again\n\n\nAnd then beyond that a consolidation phase and this is where some of your efforts can contribute to the welfare of a community\n\n\nWhen you go out there to uh provide medical assistance for instance you are really taking part now in the consolidation phase which leads to the final phase which is the full development of the  barangay  \n\n\nThat is when uh, twenty-four hour electrification is provided\n\n\nUh a good water supply system is uh put in place\n\n\nAnd maybe there is a nice schoolhouse with a full time teaching staff that would be established in the community\n\n\nAt that point we consider the  barangay  to be fully developed", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "cf835dc4-bf30-40bc-8b27-1251f8527fc8", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.193607+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nUh the title of my lecture is the same title of the book that uh Isabel read in the introduction\n\n\nUnfortunately that book is not available in the Philippines however those of you who are interested in uh reading in greater detail what I 'll be talking about there 's a uh Filipino version uh it 's in English but this is the Philippine edition of the book and it can be obtained in U P  'no  \n\n\nUh I 'm also not going to lecture I 'm going to try to make this a little bit more informal okay\n\n\nUhm I will be talking to you about the results of a study we conducted a couple of years back about the cognitive consequences of literacy and I 'd like to uh acknowledge the cooperation of my research associates uhm Mariano Santo Domingo who is uh with the U P Diliman and uh Edith Lianne Pe&ntilde;a who is now a graduate  \n\n\nWhat we were trying to study well the motivation for doing this study was to look at the effects of literacy  particularly non-formal literacy programs in marginal communities in the Philippines\n\n\nBy \" marginal \" I mean these are economically disadvantaged communities usually found in the very far-flung areas very remote from the urban areas\n\n\nUh and the the  there there are several such communities in the Philippines and for the study we selected five within the Luzon area and these are uh of different uh types of communities meaning some were agricultural some were uh fishing communities some were urban poor communities and so on\n\n\nAnd what we wanted to look at was basically what was the effect of having non-formal literacy programs these are usually adult literacy programs on the way the people in these communities think about their lives think about their livelihood and think about the world\n\n\nIt was originally intended to be a case study although uhm my my training in uh cognitive science uh predisposes me to more experimental and quasi-experimental approaches \n\n Somehow the study evolved to become a quasi-experimental study involving more more cut-and-dried variables so to speak\n\n\nWhat we ended up actually trying to answer was the following question\n\n\nI apologize it turns out the it 's probably not going to be very clear  \n\n\nUhm it says there what are the effects of literacy acquisition on thinking processes \n\n\nThis is a very broad question you know it can be answered in many different ways but what we wanted to find out was when one becomes literate what happens to the way he or she thinks\n\n\nNow this question has actually been addressed by many many different other researchers mostly people who study literacy people in uh who study cognition in literacy in particular because some people have argued that literacy has an effect in changing the way we represent information about the world\n\n\nI I 'll talk about this uh in a while\n\n\nUh there 're many many different versions of that proposition and an important distinction we have to make is between the so-called direct and indirect effects of literacy on the way people think\n\n\nWhen we say there is a direct effect the actual process of acquiring literacy in and of itself transforms the way you look at the world\n\n\nUh a very  the most popular version of this is proposed by uh maybe Bruner is familiar to you uh Cole early on was saying talking about things like this \n\n The idea was that shifting from the oral to the written mode of representing information allows the mind now to become more flexible in terms of handling the information\n\n\nJust think about it\n\n\nIf there is no printed word everything we have to know has to be stored in memory and the there will be a greater primacy on oral information and if you think about it in old civilizations those with uh no  literary tradition most of the uh most complex forms of information were stored in things like narratives uh songs  'no  long ballads epic ballads and so on\n\n\nThese were not all almost always they were not written down and they were passed on from generation to generation by actual uh rehearsal and practice and actual experience\n\n\nIt 's not something that they put in stones so to speak and put in a library  'no  \n\n\nOn the other hand when things started coming to print it achieves ideas start having some degree of permanency\n\n\nYou fixed it on paper and what that does is it frees up according to some theoreticians it frees up what we call cognitive capacity or your cognitive resources\n\n\nSuddenly the ideas don't have to be here all the time they can be on paper and so your mind can do other things\n\n\nSo that 's the direct hypothesis that the act of acquiring literacy and ability to represent information on print in print rather allows the mind to start operating in different ways\n\n\nThere are indirect ways by which literacy can also affect the mind and uh simply there are this means that literacy first affects something else and then that something else affects the way you think so uh it may be that literacy for example changes the way people live\n\n\nLiteracy might change the way information is uh handled by a community\n\n\nAnd that doesn't necessarily require uh uh a direct transformation in the way people think but because there are important transformations in the way the community now handles information people come to think of information in different ways as well\n\n\nSo you see this effect of literacy on thinking is more mediated and uh we all wanted to find out whether literacy does have a direct or indirect or maybe both effects on the way people think\n\n\nUhm this was an important question to answer particularly since we 're looking at marginalized communities because in these communities literacy practices were uh to use a more uh recent term were not yet \" technologized \" \n\n\nThey were not yet institutionalized in the communities uhm and you can even say that literacy practices were marginalized in most of these communities \n\n As you would expect in these communities literacy rates were low but there were literate people in these communities\n\n\nThere were even high school college graduates in these communities but you can imagine that uh in these communities literacy is not the most important thing to have in order to survive and succeed in that community\n\n\nIn fact most of in some of the communities those who were highly literate worked outside the community because there were no opportunities to capitalize on their literacy skills within the community themselves\n\n\nI will give you a little bit more description on the communities in a little while\n\n\nWhat we tried to do uh what what we did to answer this question was uh we looked at the communities and found participants who were either illiterate or literate\n\n\nUh we also looked at people who acquired literacy using two different modes those who acquired it through the formal educational system and those who acquired it through non-formal education uh programs  'no  \n\n\nSo that was a very broad category\n\n\nUh they might have participated in non-formal livelihood  cum  literacy education programs a lot of which were sponsored by DECS the B N F E in that area\n\n\nIn fact all of the areas we looked at there was a Bureau of Non-formal Education  adult literacy program which was tied up with uh a livelihood program\n\n\nOthers acquired their literacy skills on their own by reading comics\n\n\nUhm those who acquired literacy formally you we the cut-off was they must have been in formal education at least until grade six because previous research shows that if there 's reversion to illiteracy it 's usually around grade four or grade five\n\n\nSo we felt that making grade six as the cut-off was the was quite safe\n\n\nUhm the the non-literates or the illiterates were those who did not acquire literacy uh and we usually relied on self-reports and they a uh key informant in the community to determine this\n\n\nIf you 're concerned uh uhm just linking it to Dr Davis 's paper a while ago we did not uh we used a very low level definition of literacy here\n\n\nWe were not defining literacy in terms of functional or higher level literacy it was really being able to uh process printed words okay\n\n\nUhm you might be worried that uh about whether we were sure whether the participants were actually literate or not\n\n\nUh you know especially illiteracy is not something we would feel comfortable uh  uh talking about but surprisingly the people in these communities were not that apprehensive about saying whether they could read or write or not  'no  \n\n\nWe only had maybe two or three cases where the participants claimed to be literate but actually were not and uh we were able to find out because of the key informants  'no  \n\n\nIn these communities everyone knows everyone else okay\n\n\nUhm aside from well the idea was we were going to compare how the literates and the non-literates would perform in certain cognitive tasks to find out whether literacy does make a difference or not okay\n\n\nWe also I said I mentioned we looked at the mode of literacy acquisition a very important variable that uh we looked at \n\n Something we were not thinking of looking at initially was the degree of literacy integration in the community\n\n\nOthers would call this the the extent to which literacy was technologized in the community\n\n\nThe idea here is that each community integrates literacy practice to varying degrees\n\n\nYou can imagine Metro Manila is a very literate community  'no  \n\n\nAlmost everything we do involves some form of literacy practices you know uh when we go uh go shopping in the supermarket we have to read labels we have to be able to find out what are the prices of uh things\n\n\nWe have to be able to read signs\n\n\nWe have to fill out forms you know taxes you have to be able to read to fill complete tax forms \n\n Almost everything we do requires reading in Metro Manila well for most people\n\n\nBut imagine uh an agricultural community or a fishing community where most people have to deal with the elements of nature to earn a living\n\n\nUh people don't regularly read newspapers\n\n\nIf they do it will be tabloids  'no  \n\n\nUh it 's not an integral part of what people do  'no  \n\n\nParents don't usually read to their children\n\n\nUhm if at all children will only be required to read in school if at all there are books available\n\n\nUhm so you can imagine there are there 's a variance to the degree to which literary practices are important in a community\n\n\nAll of the communities we studied were relatively low in terms of degree of literacy integration\n\n\nThat is in none of the communities do we find the same degree of sophistication or technologization of literacy\n\n\nIf you don't like the word \" technologize \" I will stop using it just tell me\n\n\nIt 's easy to read but it 's hard to say\n\n\nUhm I will describe this variable in greater length when I talk about the communities\n\n\nFinally we wanted to look at the range of cognitive processes uh conceptual understanding conceptual organization reasoning explanation\n\n\nThe first three were  have always been implicated in studies looking at thinking and the mind\n\n\nIn particular because the hypothesis the literacy hypothesis is always stated that literacy allows people to come to achieve more formal and abstract levels of thinking\n\n\nAnd this is most manifest in conceptual thinking that 's conceptual understanding conceptual organization and abstract reasoning\n\n\nThat 's why we looked at these things okay\n\n\nYou will see get a flavor of that in a while\n\n\nThe communities we looked at uhm are as follows\n\n\nThere 's this community in uh Kiangan Ifugao\n\n\nThe S I L has done a lot of work at Kiangan\n\n\nIn particular we  focused on a  barangay  uh  Barangay  Nagakadan uh which we say calling it a  barangay  for  those of you who are based in urban communities   you might think it 's like a small thing but a  barangay  in Kiangan is several mountains you know uh so it 's like actually quite encompassing\n\n\nUh it has a very low literacy rate\n\n\nUh unique to this community was the fact that we only got illiterates and formal literates there were no non-formal literates in this community", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6472d6dd-7a03-4aad-afdf-dbe2d52733ee", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.194707+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nUh it 's always good to come home\n\n\nWhenever people ask me uh they always like to ask uh  o  how are you doing how 's everything and then they they try to bait me into making a comparison between De La Salle and U S L S  \n\n\nOf course I will never buy it\n\n\nI simply say well you know I work professionally at De La Salle but I only have one home so that will never change  \n\n\nOkay uh when Eli wrote me uh I was I really had no hesitation to to accept this invitation \n\n and uh also trying to deal with sometimes honestly you know extreme feelings of uh frustration and sometimes even almost despair at you know what is happening \n\n \n\n\nWe were looking forward to uh uh I guess a quiet and nice peaceful existence\n\n\nUh of course Cory 's term I think that woke us up early enough that it wasn't going to be that\n\n\nUh Ramos 's term we uh I guess we were sort of lulled into almost a false sense of security because things seemed to be looking up\n\n\nThen when the nineteen uh ninety-eight elections came I think you know what some of us did\n\n\nUh myself I broke an old vow I promised never to get involved in partisan politics because of the obvious uh difficulties it could present to our institutions but I broke that and you know why  'no  \n\n \n\n But after he won okay again I threatened to go into exile but I did not \n\n Uhm instead I think like most Filipinos uh who believe in the constitutional process I said let us see let us give this administration a chance \n\n\nSo we did that\n\n\nWe tried to work as as much as we could with the uh Estrada administration\n\n\nUh you even know that I made a rather unpopular decision which cost me heavily\n\n\nUh it can be told now when I agreed to accept an appointment in this so-called Constitutional Convention the CONCORD  'no  uh I was told later on that some of our faculty members at De La Salle uh actually wanted to ask for my resignation because of that involvement\n\n\nOf course it never got to that and we went through it and I guess you know it 's history now CONCORD was shelved\n\n\nFor the record I would still like to say though that if we had given that a chance I think it could have helped the country a lot but the timing I guess was not right uh  basta  many factors so it 's all of those the work we did for about four months\n\n\nI don't know if you ever found time to read that  'no  the proposed amendments to the Constitution but I think they would have helped a lot especially in terms of uh encouraging what foreign investments in the country uh in terms of correcting the flaws\n\n\nThere were some real flaws in the nineteen eighty-seven Constitution but right now well that has been shelved and has since been overtaken by events\n\n\nBut the point I 'm trying to make is that as I said like most uh Filipinos I wanted Joseph Estrada to succeed especially and I would pray hard for him to succeed okay and I really wanted him to succeed, \n\n But in the end I guess when this whole thing blew up uh what last October when the uh you know as as the revelations started to come out initiated by Governor Singson and now as we hear more and more in the Senate then I guess it 's sort of my worst fears were were just were were were borne out and therefore there is really if there was any doubt there 's really no more doubt in my mind that uh the best thing for the President really is to resign\n\n\nAnd that 's why when this broke out if you would remember De La Salle Manila was the first I think the same day that U P came out with its statement uh we came out with the statement calling for the President to resign\n\n\nAnd uh since then I think like you uh we 've been watching the impeachment and uh well we can talk about this maybe during the open forum if you have questions but anyway I watch the same uh T V channels you watch \n\n \n\n\nSo this is where we are now and uh I 'd like to uh just analyze the situation with you a a little more uh deeply if we can  'no  \n\n\nSo the current situation is that there is an impeachment trial going on uh now on its what fourth week depending how you count fifth week depending on how you and as the evidence comes out for us non-lawyers I think all we look at is the substance  'no  \n\n I said I would have made a very good lawyer because so many things that you know are so obvious to me you know and to some people \n\n \n\n\nUh you know one witness after another uh especially the more credible witnesses just telling stories that make you quite frankly sort of ashamed that you 're a Filipino\n\n\nYou know that you have a President who you know would do these things resort to these things\n\n\nSo however I think like you we also realize that uh this is gonna be tough\n\n\nMany people uh especially the hard-nosed uh what uh observers from the very start have said you know uh he 's going to be acquitted in spite of the preponderance of the evidence and they give you uh many reasons for that  'no  \n\n\nUhm number one all he needs is what eight Senators to to acquit him and it seems we know who they are\n\n\nNow there are others also that uh are sort of borderline maybe you can count about eight Senators also who are definitely going to convict him and some in between  'no  \n\n\nBut the numbers are certainly in the President 's favor plus the  of course it 's still unconfirmed rumor but uh you you know in Manila when the rumor persists I think you can almost be sure there is something to it\n\n\nAnd the rumor one rumor really that refuses to go away is that a billion pesos you know has been set aside to make sure that these eight Senators will get handsomely rewarded for a verdict of uh acquittal  'no  \n\n\nSo those are the stakes that we are uh in a sense that we are up against\n\n\nSo, the economy let 's look at the economy the current situation \n\n\nUh about a month ago a month and half ago I talked to one of the highest ranking finance officials of the government and uh well because I was trying to persuade him among others to resign \n\n uh but the most important information that he gave me was this\n\n\nThat was last I talked to him in November and at that point he said Brother we only have the government has money for the next five months we can run the government up to March\n\n\nThe Senate had been able to borrow some some monies but after March if nothing gives if there would be no significant changes okay the the economy will really be a very very serious problem  \n\n\nThe I I think again you don't have to be an economist to realize the the macropicture\n\n\nUhm I think foreign loans have stopped\n\n\nI think the World Bank I M F  I think they would not give us any new loans until this political crisis is resolved somehow\n\n\nUh foreign investors uh are are not coming in if anything they 're pulling out and of course big business and this is critical  'no  \n\n\nAlmost all of the major business leaders uh Makati Business Club and even the very you know the conservative uh P C C I  'no  uh have withdrawn their support for this administration\n\n\nSo with all of these factors the economy again of course uh if you listen to the economists uh  marami silang mga  projections which probably are are true\n\n\nThey 're saying when you put all of it together what are they saying our first two quarters next year  pwede pa 'no  \n\n\nThey claim that we would not yet really feel the the really ill effects meaning uh rise in unemployment uh rise in inflation okay uh, \n\n\nSo all the indicators they feel will hit us in the third quarter\n\n\nThat 's what they 're saying and recession if it 's going to set in would uh set in maybe in the second half of next year\n\n\nUh so that 's the state of the economy\n\n\nAnd what is clear what is clear at least from from where where I sit is that there is no turning back as far as some of these key players are concerned  parang wala na 'no  \n\n\nUh as every day that President Estrada continues in office you know will lead to this you know will lead to the further deterioration of the economy\n\n\nThat 's the situation\n\n\nOkay so let 's just take a closer look at uh what are the questions \n\n The first question the question I 'm often asked is so what 's gonna happen Brother is is he going to be uh would would the President uh be able to survive this\n\n\nWill he stay on in power or would he be removed \n\n\nI think it 's important to look at the key factors contributing to either his his removal or his stepping down from power what uh versus his continuance\n\n\nUh I think the critical factor that could lead to either his his impeachment his conviction or his resignation is really public opinion\n\n\nNow this is I think Eli was trying to make this point  'no  that the President must get the very clear message\n\n\nThat the public opinion you know increasingly would call for his stepping down from power\n\n\nNow how do you communicate that to him\n\n\nWell there are many ways uh but in the end it 's going to be public opinion\n\n\nIt will also be public opinion that will that could tilt the balance among the Senators\n\n\nDon't forget I think about five of them are going to run for re-election\n\n\nUh many of them are planning to stay in politics and only a few are are not going to uh continue in politics\n\n\n The Senators  of course they are very sensitive and this has already been tested many times\n\n\nIf you 've  if you 've been following there were many times that we were not sure how the vote would go\n\n\nFor example remember when the defense panel was trying to block the testimony of uh Clarissa Ocampo\n\n\nIn the end I think the Senators called for a meeting called for a caucus and they unanimously decided to allow Clarissa uh because of public opinion\n\n\nI think nothing else  'no  because I think they knew if they had somehow blocked her testimony uh you know they would have had a lot of explaining to do to the public okay\n\n\nUh another factor that could still lead to his uh uh conviction in in the Senate, the quality of the witnesses\n\n\nIf you notice the first batch of witnesses were all most of them are connected with Chavit Singson  'no  and most of them are somehow related to him or working with him so  parang pwede mong sabihin  well they have you know you could question their their what their their credibility because of their connections with Singson", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

let me set the tone before we dialogue, \n\n\nWe cannot even begin charting the future of this country unless we look at it in the long view in a global perspective\n\n\nBecause mark my words well within your lifetime you will see a borderless world\n\n\nThis was experimented after the second world war in Europe and now you have this very efficient unit, European Economic Community that will soon extend from the Iberian Peninsula all the way to Siberia\n\n\nThe United States of America cognizant of how potent this economic community will be and how efficient it will be is not only opening north to Canada in spite of all the labor protestations they 're opening south to Mexico\n\n\nAnd very soon you will see an an American economic community from the North to the South Pole\n\n\nHere in the Philippines we sit in the middle of half of the world 's potential market because in the Asia-Pacific we have half of the population of the world\n\n\nWe sit in the middle of the fastest growing economies in the world\n\n\nAnd so, the significance of a borderless world the efficiency of mass production, economies of scale with all the modern technologies that are coming into place will accelerate and will put us at a very good vantage point\n\n\nIt is at this point in time therefore that we should identify the areas where we enjoy the best comparative advantages and we have many of that\n\n\nIf Cebu has succeeded although we are nowhere near where we want to be it is because the Cebuanos have identified this at a very early stage perhaps out of necessity because among the eight major islands we are the poorest and we are the most densely populated per square kilometer\n\n\nIf I succeeded in doing anything in Cebu it 's putting it together and accelerating it\n\n\nBut by far the credit goes to our people our brothers and sisters in Cebu and very little of it will I admit was my doing, \n\n\nBut before we can join this, community of nations and benefit from the advantages of open borders we have to get our house in order, first\n\n\nAnd there are certain rules without exception that we must begin to realize\n\n\nLet me begin, with Cebu it is the only major island where the demography has moved from agriculture to services and manufacturing\n\n\nBecause this rule is without exception, nations where the greatest number of hands are dedicated to the production of food are the nations least capable of feeding themselves\n\n\nThink about it the U S A the most mature economy in the world only has three percent of its population dedicated to the production of food and yet they feed not only all of America but a lot of people in Russia in China in Japan all over the world as well\n\n\nBut to say that we must industrialize is not to say that we should abandon agriculture\n\n\nBecause the only source, of industry is land\n\n\nIt accelerates and increases the efficiency of agriculture when a nation industrializes\n\n\nAnd it frees many hands when you 're efficient in the manufacturing sector to go into the higher ends of income which would be services\n\n\nTo illustrate it is a bad example but it 's the only one I have in my pocket\n\n\nTo illustrate, these are nineteen eighty ballpark figures but I 'm sure they are not far from where it is today\n\n\nIn this pack of cigarettes it is an agricultural product because it 's tobacco but in this pack there are four cents worth of tobacco, \n\n\nPackaging the paper the filter the paint whatever is eighteen cents\n\n\nAnd advertising to sell this product is twenty-two cents\n\n\nIt 's a bad product and yet it sells\n\n\nBut what am I trying to say\n\n\nIf the Philippines is to become only an agricultural country and the manufacturing or the processing and the selling will be done by other countries and they source their raw material from here all we get is the four cents, \n\n\nYou know I 've often wondered uh when I was in the private sector I 'm only I 'm only in government for three years why the Philippines a democracy a free market economy very high literacy rate we certainly have the human infrastructure was so far behind left so far behind by our other democratic countries in the globe, \n\n\nSee to me I view government function as nothing but a continuous process of sourcing of funds and application, of funds\n\n\nAnd when I made an analysis I found out two things\n\n\nOne that our so-called democracy is a myth, democracy only in form but certainly not, in substance\n\n\nLet me explain\n\n\nFirst let us go to the sourcing of funds\n\n\nGovernment has three visible sources and one invisible source\n\n\nThe visible sources are income or taxes derived from income\n\n\nWe have beautiful laws\n\n\nThey 're almost as beautiful as the most perfect form of government the communist system\n\n\nBut it doesn't work\n\n\nFor the same reason communism doesn't work the human factor the human element\n\n\nOur laws are the most socially equitable\n\n\nThe higher your income the more you 're supposed to pay\n\n\nYou have the brackets and the formulas but what 's happening in actuality\n\n\nThe ones who are carrying the burden of income taxes are the salaried class and the ones who should pay the most really pay the least\n\n\nBecause of the human element or factor\n\n\nIn other words it is beautiful only on paper\n\n\nSo we go to the next, sourcing of funds and that is taxes derived from imports or duties and customs\n\n\nWhile it is a good way of sourcing funds there is a cap or a limit to what we can charge to this\n\n\nInitially it is a good protection to the local industries in order for them to be able to grow and compete\n\n\nBut in excess it is an encouragement for inefficiency and in the end it is the consumer that suffers\n\n\nSo there are pluses and minuses in the sourcing of your money for government from income from import\n\n\nAnd so we go to the next which is the big controversy now the income from consumption\n\n\nThis may not be the most socially equitable but the theory here is that when it is taxed from consumption the more you consume the more you pay and it does discourage waste in consumption\n\n\nAnd you have seen how gasoline consumption in the Philippines plunged by twenty-five percent when they upped the price and you must remember oil is a product we don't produce locally\n\n\nThis is a very controversial issue but I stand publicly and squarely with Jess Estanislao against all the politicians who want to take the position of what is popular\n\n\nAnd what I say is this if they take back position because they don't understand economics that 's bad but if they take that position because they understand economics but they want to take the popular stand that 's even worst\n\n\nAnd this I will try to illustrate to you the necessity in the next area by comparing it to the next area of sourcing of funds, the invisible tax what I call the criminal tax of borrowing the money and deficit spending\n\n\nYou see you we have a budget today of three hundred billion pesos\n\n\nIt is anticipated that government will collect only one hundred and eighty billion in taxes\n\n\nSo the government will have to borrow a hundred and twenty billion to be able to cover the budget\n\n\nWe have these three visible taxes one the invisible\n\n\nNow let me illustrate to you why to me this is a criminal tax\n\n\nYou see when government goes into deficit spending every man woman and child in this country pays for it equally including the unborn\n\n\nWhen I used to go to school and a few professors here as well we used to pay ten centavos for a Coca-Cola you remember this\n\n\nNow now you guys and gals there are paying five pesos maybe for it\n\n\nThat four ninety is the tax you are paying now for fiscal irresponsibility overspending by government in those years where you were not even born yet and you are paying for it now, \n\n\nNow, when you say and demonstrate to bring down the prices of fuel and make uh you will of course note that none of those were in the EDSA revolution these two groups\n\n\nBut when you go around are you really doing the poorest of the poor a favor\n\n\nYou know these are special interest groups transportation groups labor groups  etcetera  yes they consume some some of that oil but who speaks for the native in Mount Pinatubo who never consumed a drop of that oil\n\n\nWho speaks for the jobless who don't need transportation rides to jobs because they have no jobs\n\n\nWho speaks for the farmer who hardly consumes that fuel\n\n\nAnd that is the greatest mass of this country and if it is not sourced from, consumption then everyone pays equally as you are paying for it now for something that was spent even before you were born\n\n\nAnd that is the equation \n\n So they 're barking at the wrong tree\n\n\nBecause where we should be barking is towards Congress and the administration and I say not only this but all administrations past have been irresponsible fiscally because of deficit spending\n\n\nThat is the area that we should eliminate\n\n\nLet me at this point go therefore after discussing with you the sourcing of funds of the national government to the area of application of funds\n\n\nWhy do we need such a huge budget of three hundred billion pesos\n\n\nI think this is where the biggest defect is and this is where the demonstrations should be loudest, in the government 's inability to apply those funds efficiently\n\n\nLet me begin by the fact that government is involved in a lot of businesses and interventions into our economy where they have no business being there\n\n\nPhilippine Airlines bankrupt\n\n\nYou know you 'd have to pay the buyer money to take Philippine Airlines\n\n\nFertilizer plants that lose seven billion hotels and so on all these investments\n\n\n you know it is not  government involve itself in areas where the private sector are more efficient, \n\n\nIn  privatize to the extent possible what now the government is doing including education\n\n\nBecause it is proven that private education has had much much more quality and is much much more efficient, \n\n\nSecond local autonomy\n\n\nYou know what I call imperial Manila want to hold on to those powers and to that money as if their dear lives depended on it\n\n\nI do not want to impute malice\n\n\nBut let us just say that if they wanted to construct two school rooms instead of one in the  barangays  in Cebu if they just gave those  barangays  the money for the same amount of money they could probably build two or three more rooms than they are doing it now when it is centrally handled by the D P W H\n\n\nAgain this is human nature\n\n\nThey are never going to see or use those roads those water systems those schoolhouses and so they couldn't care less that 's just a piece of paper in front of them\n\n\nI can give you a million examples\n\n\nBut what we did in Cebu is we just in case of national highways I just threw out D P W H\n\n\nYou know, when I came to office they had already awarded the Cebu South Link that would have linked us to Tagbilaran Bohol and uh Dumaguete Negros with a beautiful highway so that we could have expanded our uh our industries to those areas because distance is relative to time travel and cost of travel\n\n\nThe bidding was in nineteen eighty-six\n\n\nTo this day we 're nineteen ninety-one the accomplishment is less than thirty percent\n\n\nBy the same token the province of Cebu had an a cementation project longer stretch in the west coast and in the north theirs was asphalt ours was cement we bidded this in March of nineteen eighty-nine in March of nineteen ninety total completion\n\n\nYou know it 's not just the cost our cost will probably be only a third of what it will cost the national government when they finally if they finally finish that project\n\n\nThe opportunities lost is what is more expensive\n\n\nIn other words the economic activity that would have occurred if this highway were to have been completed linking the richest agricultural island in the republic to the number one industrial island\n\n\nSo I won't give you any more examples I think that is quite enough but before you go to sleep let me tell you let me break this with a joke\n\n\nYou know this professor from University of La Salle is very fond of experiments\n\n\nAnd uh one day he caught a grasshopper right out there where you have your grass and experimented on a grasshopper \n\n He put it on the table and ordered it to jump so the grasshopper jumped\n\n\nTakes the grasshopper removes one leg puts it on a table he orders it again jump \n\n\nLopsided but it still jumped\n\n\nTakes it he removes the last leg from the grasshopper he puts it on the table and he orders it to jump jump \n\n\nOf course it wouldn't jump\n\n\nSo prognosis he writes in his book  after you remove two legs from a grasshopper it suffers from hearing impairment   \n\n\nThese are the solutions that our government has been giving us from time immemorial, \n\n\nYou know, to me even how difficult the situations are you can always find a way to veer away from the normal and if there are any people who have succeeded in doing this the Cebuanos have\n\n\nWe have pretended now there is no national government and we 're proceeding on our own full steam\n\n Let me show you a few transparencies on how we perform after we gained six basic freedoms", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nUh ladies and gentlemen good afternoon\n\n\nUhm even before coming here I was expecting the kind of treatment I was going to get from your present President\n\n\nAnd I have been faulted for two reasons\n\n\nThe first thing I have been faulted for is my past, namely my having been at the Ateneo all of my scholastic life practically\n\n\nUh the other one is of course being related to Mr Daland\n\n\nUh the Ateneo I had a choice about my relationship to Mr Daland I had no choice about\n\n\nSo I hope you will forgive me for one and tolerate me for the other\n\n\nUh if you will note this is the Waldo Perfecto Hall uh the Perfectos are Ateneo boys in fact uh Mr Waldo Perfecto was a former Jesuit and uh he decided he was going to fulfill his duties to God by evangelizing and then he joined La Salle,  \n\n\nSo the process of evangelization takes uh many shapes and I suppose that 's one of the reasons why I 'm here\n\n\nEnough of the nonsense\n\n\nUhm you are in Business and that is good\n\n\nYou are Catholic businessmen or you should be Catholic businessmen and that means it will be difficult to be good\n\n\nBut neither being a businessman nor being a Christian or a Catholic or even just being a decent man is a justification for anything else except being a good businessman good at being a human being and good at being a businessman and being a general member of the community\n\n\nUh the the gentleman who introduced me I mean the gentleman who opened the the proceedings talked about uh honesty and business or the law and business\n\n\nThat is so broad a field that I could write books on the darn thing and not be finished with it\n\n\nBut the topic given to me uh in the letter from uh Mr Daland was with regard to the corruption in government whether there is any hope of minimizing it\n\n\nThe title I think is rather well phrased in the sense that corruption like original sin or like the consequences of original sin cannot be abolished\n\n\nAt best we can minimize hopefully we can live with it and if we are really lucky to live happily with the very little that there is insofar as graft and corruption in government will be concerned\n\n\nUh the issue of graft and corruption is both historical and psychological\n\n\nThe political aspect of graft and corruption is  merely consequential rather than caused\n\n\nThe political situation can be sometimes a product rather than a cause for graft and corruption\n\n\nBut that is neither here nor there\n\n\nIt is almost as easy or just as difficult to talk about which came first like many other things that which came first\n\n\nLet me then take off from a number of perspectives\n\n\nLet me pull uh rank on you by age and tell you about how graft and corruption has been recorded not only in this country but elsewhere\n\n\nLet me then take you to what I do and then take you finally and hopefully to what we can do\n\n\nMaybe that will make a little sense\n\n\nUhm corruption is not a uniquely Filipino weakness or fault\n\n\nGovernment corruption is not uniquely Filipino I hope\n\n\nUndoubtedly we have been presented many examples of honesty and uprightness in different countries and as you look at these and then look at those countries you realize that graft corruption or dishonesty whichever way you want to call it takes or manifests itself in many different forms\n\n\nWe are told for example that certain third world countries are replete with graft in all aspects of society whether in government in business or in any other generally accepted form of human endeavor including schools\n\n\nIf you don't believe in graft and corruption just go to an examination room one any day and you will find that a form a budding form to say the least of graft and corruption is in process\n\n\nAnd apparently I would imagine as much in La Salle as in the Ateneo corruption in class is in good health thank you, \n\n\nPerhaps \" is in good health no thank you \" \n\n\nAt all events uh insofar as government is concerned we are pointed to with references to honesty to Japan to the European countries and even to the United States\n\n\nHowever I I submit to you that these examples are partially correct and serve only to demonstrate that these countries are filled with human beings and that for all of the external appearances of honesty they have their own forms of graft and corruption which they have carried on to a rather refined and very very prosperous enterprise\n\n\nJapan we are told is the epitome of honesty in the sense that if you lose or leave a bag or any article in the Japanese subway or on the bus you can generally find it within the same day or else in the next day at the at the headquarters or at the nearest offices of that particular bus company\n\n\nAnd this is probably true this is equally true of many other forms of honesty we are told in Japan\n\n\nHowever Japan is also the place of the  Yakuza  \n\n\nAnd the  Yakuza  has a very viable and very fruitful relationship with the National Police Department of Japan\n\n\nIf you want you could go into business and think about it some more there is also the problem of  meetings\n\n\nAs you might know if you don't know as you may have been told  meetings are places where the owners of the company both large and small may be heard may demand an explanation for certain matters of importance to the company and can demand explanations from the managers and the owner or the officers of that company\n\n\nAnd as you may have heard large corporations tend to be  tend to have raucous rowdy  meetings because there is always a group of stockholders that are out there to just exercise their lungs and generally give everybody else an uncomfortable time at the head table\n\n\nThis apparently is something that never happens in Japan for the very simple reason that before the  meetings the bosses talk to the hoodlums who come to the  meetings so that if anybody gets rowdy he gets surrounded and very gently taken out of the premises\n\n\nIf you think that 's honesty you 're welcome to it but it 's not particularly something that you would like to point out as the epitome of civilization\n\n\nNeedless to say there are the the scandals that have rocked the business world in Japan are current and quite often\n\n\nYou can start with a large scale bribery from the sale of Lockheed aircraft Tri-Star aircraft if any of you are interested to sell to Japan a lot of kickbacks took place\n\n\nAnd it was not the Japanese who complained\n\n\nIt was discovered because the Americans had to go over the balance sheets of Lockheed Corporation and they discovered that Lockheed was paying off people in Japan in Europe and in different parts of the world\n\n\nGraft and corruption does exist there\n\n\nGraft and corruption of course exists in the United States\n\n\nWhere do you think we learned all of the ways to do things in the Philippines\n\n\nAnd they continue to do it only because of the nature of the job because of the nature of how they do things it is has to be done in a more refined way\n\n\nNeedless to say in Europe graft and corruption exists in its own way\n\n\nThere is a lot of uh, improprieties which take place in government which are being looked at and kept quiet about\n\n\nOne of the more exciting things for you gentlemen who might indulge in the better life is that periodically in Europe, one of the greater and more profitable forms of corruption is to dilute or to mislabel wine, \n\n\nThis is uh apparently a matter of large honor for many wineries for many vineyards in Europe to be able to ascertain that a particular brand of wine does indeed come from a particular vineyard so that its quality can be maintained and the label will sell the wine\n\n\nBut big rackets take place big frauds are discovered periodically in this respect\n\n\nGovernments have fallen because of the irregularities would you believe also in public works and in other forms of government activity\n\n\nSo graft and corruption is not exclusively Filipino\n\n\nNeither is it a modern happening in the Philippines\n\n\nWe have had graft and corruption for as long as there has been recorded history\n\n\nAnd for all we know since even before recorded history there were Filipinos who were human beings we can be almost certain that graft and corruption took place at that time as well\n\n\nBut insofar as the Philippines is concerned you will recall that, recorded history in the Philippines is a western staple that is to say when Magellan came then they say recorded history in the Philippines took place\n\n\nAlthough those of you who know better will know that even before the entry of the Spaniards before the entry of the European colonial masters there was history there was literature and there was organized government in this part of the world\n\n\nAt all events one of the difficult problems at that time was, how to bring into this administrative system that was known as the Philippine colony that is that was the Philippine colony of Spain efficient administration and honest administration\n\n\nRemember that at that time the entry to the Philippines was motivated by two historical Spanish facts\n\n\nOne was religion the faith and the other was money, \n\n\nThere was a great competition in Europe at that time and the two maritime powers at that time were Portugal and Spain\n\n\nThey divided the world by cutting, by drawing a a line around the entire globe and said everything on one side belongs to Spain everything on the other side belongs to Portugal \n\n\nOf course the Dutch had not heard about this and the English had not heard about this so eventually they started coming around and deciding that the lines were drawn improperly or that they were going to ignore the lines\n\n\nAt all events the Philippines was peculiarly situated insofar as Spain is concerned and since this is not going to be a lecture let us just  \n\n\nIf you would look at your globe  that was meant to be complete circles equidistant from the center and of the same size\n\n\nIf you don't think so, at all events uhm you must assume that Spain was on one part of the globe and the Philippines is on the other side\n\n\nAnd the only reason why the Spaniards got to the Philippines was because somebody tried to prove that the world was round\n\n\nSomebody else went ahead of him Christopher Columbus who was a genuine Italian carrying the flag of Spain and had landed,  alam ko na 'yung <unclear> words </unclear> na 'yan , had landed in what he thought was India was the East\n\n\nSo he crossed over to the Atlantic and he went there\n\n\nOf course the rest of the civilized the rest of the European world went there as well\n\n\nEventually Spain took a very dominant position on the on the matter and almost <unclear> word </unclear> of Southern the lower North America Central America and South America became Spanish or Latin dominions\n\n\nIn the meantime of course Magellan had crossed over gone through the Strait of Magellan down to Southeast  South uh South America went all the way up and then landed in the Philippines\n\n\nThe point of it all was that at a certain time it was very easy it became quite easy and quite prosperous to go to Latin America\n\n\nThat was where gold was Pizarro in Peru and everybody else <unclear> words </unclear> plenty of booty for Spain, \n\n\nFor this reason there was very little reason there was very little cause for anybody to cross the Pacific once more and come to the Philippines, \n\n\nAnd therefore the people that came to the Philippines were a very limited group\n\n\nGenerally they would be people who 'd be highly motivated, like priests and religious who would be burning with zeal to push forth Christ among the dark worlds of the, of the heathen which this part of the world was supposed to have been populated with\n\n\nBut the bottom line was that unless you were highly motivated you would not come to the Philippines\n\n\nThe other people who would come to the Philippines would be those who 'd want to advance their careers in Spain and therefore choose hazard duty\n\n\nThe third class was the kind of Spaniard who had to get out of Spain because he was running away from the police he was running away from the debtors or he was running away from his girlfriend 's family\n\n\nAnd if he went  if he was particularly unfortunate, and he went to the New World that would not be far enough\n\n\nAnd if he couldn't hide in the New World he would land in Vera Cruz cross over to Acapulco and then take another boat to the Philippines\n\n\nHe had to be a fairly desperate man apparently to come to the Philippines\n\n\nAnd very desperate men are very seldom honest men\n\n\nAt all events the only interesting economic activity as far as the Spanish colonialism in the Philippines is concerned was the galleon trade\n\n\nAnd the galleon trade was nothing else but a <unclear> 1 word </unclear> from Acapulco to Manila so that it could trade on spices silks and silver, with China\n\n\nAnd everything was a business was a matter of making percentage on what the costs were\n\n\nSo the entire principal economic activity of Spain in the Philippines for a long long time was concentrated in Manila\n\n\nAnd as happens to these things graft and corruption became rather rampant in Manila and in the Philippines\n\n\nOf course this couldn't happen for very long so what the Spanish government one of the steps that the Spanish government decided to adopt was this idea of having the incoming administration conduct an investigation on the outgoing administration\n\n\nThe assumption would be that anybody who was unhappy who had objections to the way the government had been run on the last few years would now protest and present their complaints to the incoming administration who had no connections whatever and therefore would be able to render fair judgement", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "21770cdc-3769-4545-8103-90ab58d7e630", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThank you Prof Bala for that generous introduction\n\n\nI was beginning to wonder, if I recognized myself from that introduction, \n\n\nDr Sibayan Sir, greetings again and a happy birthday may you have many many more\n\n\nMrs Sibayan and family, Bro Andrew, officers of administration and faculty of De La Salle University, fellow members of the Linguistic Society of the Philippines, donors, of the Chair, staff of the uh S I L, my Commander-in-Chief Colonel Ravina who is there,  who said he was going to stay away this afternoon, to spare me my nerves  and who had granted me all the space for my professional growth my one and only sister and sibling  sibling and best friend Dr Purificacion Valera Quisumbing, colleagues, friends, one and all, good afternoon, \n\n\nI hope this paper is going to answer one question that uh Dr Bautista here asked me not so very long ago, with all of that, which Nita enumerated she asked me where do you get time to do any research, \n\n\nI have not given you my full text\n\n\nI have given you only, some sheets that will be central to my paper and to which I will refer you can follow follow me every now and then, \n\n\nWhen pressed for a title I took one week to play around with many possibilities and when the deadline was on me I had to dish out what you have there \" Interlanguage and Error Analysis Revisited \" \n\n\nBut it is most apropos, \n\n\nSchumann in nineteen seventy-five proposed three variables in the growing interest on second language acquisition\n\n\nThese are the \" why \" the \" how \" and the \" what \" of the learner\n\n\nThe \" why \" consists of the affective variables that can be seen as initiators of second language learning and to which to a large degree regulate the extent of the learning\n\n\nThe \" how \" are the cognitive operations that the learner performs on the target language input data\n\n\nThe what referred to as the linguistics product are the linguistic results of the operations in terms of the particular grammatical forms the learner uses when he attempts to speak the target language, \n\n\nUh much earlier the first uh time I encountered this uh theory uh it was presented in three boxes with the \" why \" as the first box going into the second box which is the \" how \" and into the third box which is the \" what \", \n\n\nA little earlier than Schumann 's proposal, Selinker at an international conference in the late nineteen  nineteen sixty-nine introduced the notion of interlanguage\n\n\nAnd may I refer you to the first sheet there with the three circles, \n\n\nHe later pursued this concept of interlanguage along with a new look at errors\n\n\nThe term \" interlanguage \" is referred to by other names depending upon the viewpoint of the investigation of language learning\n\n\nIt is called approximative system by Nemser and transitional language by Corder, \n\n\nIf the investigation is viewed as developmental therefore dynamic it is called approximative system\n\n\nUh you have the other figure there, which is linear, \n\n\nIn the view if the view is of a particular point in time in a continuum it is more often called transitional language\n\n\nOn the whole however the general term is \" interlanguage \" \n\n\nNow you can see that in that first that first circle there is supposed to be the native language of the learner, with its own rules\n\n\nAnd the third circle, which I which is language two or the target language also has its own rules\n\n\nNow the circle in the middle which is the interlanguage is the uh circle I am I have sourced my uh data, \n\n\nIt is, that which has fascinated me for, more than a decade\n\n\nThis paper revisits the interlanguage of a group of Filipino professionals\n\n\nIt looks more closely at the \" what \" of the language user meaning the linguistic product of this group\n\n\nTo do this in some detail and to arrive at an interpretation of why it is what it is the companion hypothesis called the new error analysis by Richards as well as by Selinker is here operationalized, \n\n\nThis interlanguage refers to a separate linguistic system whose existence we are compelled to hypothesize based upon the observed output which results from the second language  attempted production of a target language norm\n\n\nIt is a dynamic product of a psycholinguistic system\n\n\nAlong with this dynamic view Selinker further expounded the notion of fossilization which he characterizes as a mechanism whereby speakers of a particular native language will keep certain linguistic items rules subsystems in the interlanguage no matter what amount of instruction they receive in the language two, target language, \n\n\nRelated to this notion of fossilization is that of backsliding called regression which refers to the regular reappearance or reemergence in interlanguage productive performance of linguistic structures which were thought to be eradicated\n\n\nThis he called an interlanguage norm not the interlanguage norm, the reason being that an interlanguage norm refers to an individual learner 's development and not to an institutionalized code of a language community\n\n\nUh may I add here that when this I L theory first appeared, and was tried out it was best found to work uh with individual learners\n\n\nWhen I used this, for my dissertation I uhm thought perhaps that even if it were best to work for an individual learner 's uh language two, and because of course I was having problems with my uh teaching and uh hunting witch-hunting for errors I thought perhaps that trying out this uh theory this hypothesis I would be able to come to some kind of a direction that would be not necessarily the interlanguage norm of Filipino uh speakers of English but at least some kind of a norm especially for my students\n\n\nWithout having to say here definitely that the data here is an institunal institutionalized code of the Filipino adult professional I posit however that the language investigation can establish some  common language characteristics of the Filipino bilingual professional who has not attained near-native professional proficiency\n\n\nAnd that is where I uhm, I have culled, my latest uh collection of these so-called errors which uh you also have in your handout, \n\n\nUh I have I will end this paper with a question of which I do not have an answer but which I think maybe you will help me provide an answer in due time\n\n\nThe next time around uh the first time I tested this hypothesis was for my dissertation, \n\n\nI collected data from the written works of sophomore students at U P Diliman who were taking their last G E English course, \n\n\nThree sets of compositions from each student subject were examined\n\n\nA total of about two hundred twenty-five compositions were corrected by three professors\n\n\nThe deviances or mistakes or lapses were identified and examined collected and classified according to a scheme suggested by Selinker and Richards, \n\n\nThe next time around that I  tested this hypothesis was with a sampling of college teachers across disciplines in some selected state colleges and universities around the country\n\n\nThe findings of the first research were confirmed by those of the second and they seemed to hold in my present research, \n\n\nThe subjects the subjects of this research are adult professionals also from different disciplines\n\n\nAn added dimension to my earlier conclusions and insights had posed a question about the Filipino bilingual professional\n\n\nThat I will ask at the end of this report\n\n\nLet me postulate that when a non-native speaker of English like the Fini Filipino adult in this study learns English as a second language\n\n\nMay I uh refer you to that line there where you have the beginning of the line \" the learner, one uh uhm language the native language speaker with L one \" and the end of that line \" the speaker of the  target language \" excuse me who is which is English in our case, \n\n\nUhm so he moves through a series of intermediate stages in between his native language at one end and English at the other end\n\n\nThis assumes that these stages are necessary way stations, which the learner traverses if he expects to make progress, in achieving proficiency and competence hopefully in the target language, \n\n\nErrors are characteristics of these way stations, \n\n\nAnd they are the ones that have fascinated me all of these, years\n\n\nError analysis used to examine identified lapses deviances of the adult professional subjects is not new as we teachers have engaged in it, for all our professional lives\n\n\nBut there is a significant difference between the old and the new and that 's the one that is intriguing\n\n\nIt 's a little bit difficult because you just don't count uh the uh occurrences of these deviances and assign numerical uh grades to them\n\n\nAnd from my experience before I encountered this hypothesis just like everybody else and I think that that is exactly what 's still happening the more deviances mistakes you call errors, the better for a grade for for a grade of five meaning uh failure, \n\n\nThat 's what I called witch-hunting then, \n\n\nBut my outlook has changed drastically since, \n\n\nUhm I even say that I have become more human in my teaching and in my outlook at errors since I encountered this uhm theory, \n\n\nThe old error analysis looked at errors and classified them on a superficial basis, \n\n\nLinguistic items were either omitted, added, substituted or reordered in spelling in grammar or in diction, \n\n\nAnd I have a table there, the third one the third figure which shows which gives you a matrix of what we used to do or what we what most of us are still wont to do, \n\n\nThese were labeled as such and accounted for, \n\n\nThe total number of occurrences were assigned percentages\n\n\nThe new look at errors was based, on the C A theory, \n\n\nThe contrastive analysis theory by the way attempted at describing a language with all its features and then comparing these with a target language equally and thoroughly described\n\n\nLater it began to look like an impractical and formidalble  formidable task\n\n\nMeanwhile the seeming <.> impracticality or impracticability and formidability of the task showed the contrastive  inadequacy at predicting and  explaining all  errors\n\n\nThe strong version of this theory states that one could predict and describe the patterns that will cause difficulty in learning and those that will not cause difficulty\n\n\nThis eventually could not however be sustained to determine competence\n\n\nAnd that is when the interlanguage theory and hypothesis came to being\n\n\nHence the introduction of the I L hypothesis and theory that refers to a system whose existence we are compelled to hypothesize based on the evidence of the language  that the speaker-user is using\n\n\nMeaning that which he has learned at a particular point in the course or in time and keep looking I keep uh inviting you to look at that line there which I said earlier uh is a line through which the learner traverses as he tries to attain proficiency and competence in the second language, \n\n\nThe new error analysis is said to be more adequate for judging, not only performance but more importantly competence\n\n\nThat 's the old error analysis uh including that of the uh that was based on the contrastive analysis was said to be best to judge only performance and not competence and Selinker with his I L had proffered the uh advantage of the new error analysis  uh error analysis which is best to gauge competence, \n\n\nThe new error analysis is said to be more adequate for judging not only performance as I said earlier but more importantly competence\n\n\nIt takes off from the old by interpreting the errors from the viewpoint of knowledge of the language not knowledge about the language\n\n\nIn the end the theories of both psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics enter into the judging or the decision-making on whether a sentence or an utterance is error-free or erroneous\n\n\nNow you can see how it can be a little bit tedious to engage in this new error analysis hypothesis because there are certain assumptions from language acquisition as well as from sociology  sociolinguistics that one has to have on hand or to be familiar about if he has to be able to make all the necessary inferences to judge the degree of erroneous uh of the erroneous sentences degree of errors, \n\n\nThis new look at errors is a natural adjunct on second language acquisition\n\n\nIt yields not only performance analysis but also error sources to gauge degree of competence\n\n\nThus the questions to put each superficially well-formed sentence through are shown in figure four", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\n To be here although I must say I dreaded the thought of having to face uh language experts uh one reason being that uh I 'm not at all an expert\n\n\nIn fact somebody one of the faculty members of U P <unclear> 1 word </unclear> said you have arrived you are now speaking before the Linguistic Society of the Philippines \n\n\nShe probably knows what sort of grades I got from the English Department  \n\n\nUh uhm the other reason uh as I said I 'm a chemist I 've never written anything on language\n\n\nAnd third as you probably know this is a very highly emotionally-charged issue and it 's like entering the lion 's den\n\n\nUhm, when I was Assistant to the President of the University of the Philippines uh a few years back just before I became Commissioner of the Commission on Higher Education uh President Javier gave me an assignment and that is to advise him on all the science and technology activities of the University\n\n\nHe tried also to give me another assignment and that is to work with the, uh, linguists in the U P to put together a language program\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nI said uh Emil uh I I never retreat from work I I you know I work very hard uh I 've never refused my President whoever it was Angara Abueva and now you I 've never refused\n\n\nBut this time please this is one job I don't want to do\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nSo you can understand\n\n\nNow the only reason I 'm here is because Brother Andrew wrote me a little note and since I have worked with Brother Andrew for a long time and he has never refused me I cannot refuse him now , \n\n\nUh may I now read my paper and uh I 've written a lot of papers uh uh but I 've never studied as hard as for this one  \n\n\nI don't wanna make a fool of myself so I hope I won't today\n\n\nUh the language as I already said the language policy in education is a highly emotionally-charged issue and has been debated over several decades apparently without a final resolution\n\n\nUhm this paper will discuss the present language policy of the Commission on Higher Education\n\n\nIt must be made clear however that the CHED is still relying on the old DECS bilingual policy instituted in nineteen eighty-seven a reiteration incorporating some modifications on the one earlier issued in nineteen seventy-three\n\n\nWhen I received the invitation I talked with Chairman Alcala I said do we have a new policy and he said none\n\n\nSo but I knew that you 'd throw me bodily out of this if if that 's all I 'm gonna tell you\n\n\nThe constitutional and legal basis of the policy will be presented and the status of implementation discussed\n\n\nFinally some recommendations will be made as basis of future action\n\n\nI must emphasize that these recommendations are not official CHED policy but are purely my personal views on the matter\n\n\nSome of them of course these some of these recommendations are already being done by CHED so those and those will be mentioned accordingly\n\n\nWhat is the constitutional and legal basis of the present policy\n\n\nUh I don't wanna bore you with this but I 'm going to read it anyway\n\n\nSection six of the nineteen eighty  and article whatever of the nineteen eighty-seven Constitution provides that and I quote  the national language of the Philippines is Filipino, as it evolves it shall be further developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages  \n\n\nI for those who haven't noticed it yet I changed the topic to \" language policy \" not \" English uh policy \" or whatever\n\n\nFurthermore it states that and I quote again  for the purposes of communication and instruction the official languages of the Philippines are Filipino and until otherwise provided by law English  end of quote\n\n\nPursuant to this uh the Congress passed a law creating the National Language Commission which undertakes coordinates and promotes research for the development propagation and preservation of Filipino and other languages, \n\n\nUh, the what is the present uh policy in the so called bilingual policy\n\n\nI will go through from the nineteen seventy-four so we will understand how this evolved\n\n\nOn June nineteen nineteen seventy-four the Department of Education Culture and Sports issued Department Order number twenty-five mandating the use of English and Filipino as media of instruction in Philippine primary and secondary schools according to a set timetable, \n\n\nThe purpose of the policy was for the Philippines to become and I quote  a bilingual nation competent in both Filipino and English  \n\n\nAt that time it was Pilipino P and not Filipino F, Filipino F and not Pilipino P okay\n\n\nDomains were divided into an English domain English Communication Arts Mathematics and Science and a Pilipino domain which includes all the other subjects\n\n\nBeginning in grade one for Tagalog-speaking areas for school year nineteen seventy-four seventy-five and beginning in grade one for non-Tagalog-speaking areas in school year seventy-eight to seventy-nine\n\n\nSorry about that it 's nineteen seventy-nine,  \n\n\nNote that by school year nineteen eighty-one eighty-two the shift of medium was to begin in all high schools\n\n\nHowever for the tertiary level institutions there was no set timetable but it said that by nineteen eighty-three eighty-four graduates from colleges and universities were supposed to be able to pass examinations in English and or Pilipino for the practice of their professions\n\n\nI want to emphasize this because uh this is a major issue, \n\n\nThe first uh bilingual policy was based on the nineteen seventy-three Constitution\n\n\nWhen the nineteen eighty-six Constitution was ratified the  Education Department now called DECS revised the bilingual policy which is now entitled \" The Nineteen Eighty-Seven Policy on Bilingual Education \" \n\n\nIn the nineteen eighty-seven uh B E P, tertiary education institutions were now given a primary role in contrast to their relative freedom in the earlier version\n\n\nAs I mentioned already in the earlier version they just said by such and such date the students should now be able to take the examination\n\n\nIn this version now it says  tertiary level institutions shall lead, in the, continuing intellectualization of Filipino  it 's now F\n\n\n  The program of intellectualization however shall also be pursued both in elementary and secondary levels   \n\n\nUh by the way I must confess that up to now I 'm still confused about the P and the F\n\n\nBut the way I understand it P  is really mostly uh Tagalog and and uh F  would now incorporate more of uh the other languages and in fact has uh the the alphabet is a little bit uh includes other other letters, \n\n\nHow about the implementation of the policy\n\n\nAgain I would like to review the implementation of the policy because the recommendations I 'm going to make which as I said are purely mine are based on what we have and what we can do\n\n\nOkay I don't wanna dream and say I 'm going to do this tomorrow, \n\n\nTo have an assessment of the effects of the bilingual education policy instituted in nineteen seventy-four a formal summative evaluation was made which covered the period nineteen seventy-four to eighty-five\n\n\nIn nineteen eighty-six the six volume technical report Bilingual Education in the Philippines prepared for the  Department of Education Culture and Sports was completed\n\n\nThis was done by a group of uh Brother Andrew\n\n\nThe findings of the evaluation study on the implementation of the nineteen seventy-four bilingual education policy showed to what extent intents and purposes may have been realized\n\n\nAlso it must have provided the context within which the subsequent policy in nineteen eighty-seven was formulated\n\n\nThe above-mentioned studies by Gonzalez  et al  nineteen eighty-eight and Segovia for the tertiary level on the implementation of the nineteen seventy-four policy was made and the following is a summary of the findings\n\n\nAnd I must confess to Brother Andrew we practically copied what he had there, \n\n\nI will not read everything uh but I will just like to point out a few things, and uh okay for example number one language and language use\n\n\nPilipino is used often at that time it was still Pilipino even in classes where English is supposed to be used exclusively\n\n\nThe vernacular or local language is used only rarely\n\n\nThat 's one quite important uh, \n\n\nNow how about achievement\n\n\nAgain this is very important because uh, generally the students did better in Pilipino than in any other subject, \n\n\nThis is still true up to now\n\n\nFew students at all grade levels reach a point of being able to handle questions calling for higher cognitive functions\n\n\nThe inescapable conclusion is that there is a real failure in achievement and indication of real problems in the system\n\n\nHowever uh okay uh down the  at the bottom okay  maybe in the middle  the influence of the number of years of B E P on achievement in subject skills is negligible\n\n\nSo these are some of the more important conclusions and lastly uh you can read the rest uh later on\n\n\nThe popular  notion that Pilipino negatively affects the learning learning of English is not borne out by the data\n\n\nCorrelations of test scores in Pilipino and English with test scores in the three content areas  Araling Panlipunan  Mathematics and Science are all positive significant and mostly high\n\n\nSo these are some of the more important conclusions uh there are more, \n\n\n Pampahaba ng papel itong ginawa ni  Father  Brother Andrew, \n\n\nUh, now number four uhm okay the impact of B E P and Pilipino on test scores\n\n\nIn general Pilipino test scores and B E P seemed to be good for Tagalog as uh I could imagine N C R and excellent public and private schools in learning Mathematics and Science thus favoring native Tagalogs especially those in already excellent public and private schools\n\n\nLearning was facilitated by Pilipino while English was maintained and enhanced a decided advantage of Tagalogs in urban communities, \n\n\nOff the record we uh the U P uh uh I can't remember the year I was still Vice-President at the time uh gave tests in both languages okay  medyo nagkamali naparami 'yung Pilipino , \n\n\nWhen, when uh we looked at the results okay it turns out that all in all regions of the country\n\n\nWhat we did was we analyzed the results okay for English only, uh Tagalog Pilipino only answers in English only answers in English and Pilipino only and uh uh the mixture okay\n\n\nWe studied all three\n\n\nAnd we looked the ones who passed the UPCAT were those who uh passed you know uh, those who had higher grades in Pilipino those who had higher grades in English and the combination\n\n\nSo no one was disadvantaged\n\n\nAnyway what we found out was except for N C R, uh those who took Pilipino had higher uh achievement in all the regions had  you know\n\n\nWe compared it with the previous prior years uh better uh, scores in all regions of the country\n\n\nSo we cannot say that uh the the Tagalogs have and I have uh I think I have a reason\n\n\nIt 's because uhm in in Manila in N C R most of the most of many of the kids who take the UPCAT are from the private schools and the better high schools and they they are quite fluent in English\n\n\nSo, that 's, uhm so you know, \n\n\nUh, I 'm sorry uh, \n\n\nThe findings forces us to rethink the basic objective the teaching and learning of Pilipino it turns out that its contribution to the learning of content subjects even in  Araling Panlipunan  is minimal\n\n\nThese are the studies in the elementary and high school \n\n\nOops   sorry, \n\n\nUh, and uh number six the transfer of English language skills between Pilipino and English\n\n\nIt shows increasing dependent on Pilipino to learn English in the upper grades but decreasing dependence on English to learn Pilipino uh\n\n\nSo again that 's an interesting result of the study uhm, \n\n\nAnother one is that the non-B E P students those who were not following the uh policy in students in grade ten scored significantly better in English I just I can imagine that there were no significant differences in Math and Science\n\n\nWhile B E P students scored significantly better in Social Studies higher in Pilipino a not expected result unexpected result because they were learning in Pilipino uh, \n\n\nNow since our interest is really in the tertiary level\n\n\nNo for English the best predictor of achievement was Science, for Pilipino Social Studies and English\n\n\nAnd for English Pilipino was significant though a minor predictor\n\n\nThe other thing that we learned from the UPCAT is that those who are good in Science are also good in Language and those who are good in Language are good in both, English or Filipino, \n\n\nAt the tertiary level it seems that uh B E P is not a priority at the college level considering that only slightly more than one third of the schools in the study implemented it\n\n\nThis was in nineteen eighty-eight okay\n\n\nAnd it was a study from seventy-four to eighty-four\n\n\nMost of the tertiary institutions that implemented it had no carefully designed comprehensive and long-range support system for its implementation\n\n\nImplementation was more a perfunctory compliance than a desire to try B E P as a solution to the language-of-instruction problems in tertiary education\n\n\nGenerally moderately positive the attitudes of administrators faculty members and and students at best could mean simply openness to the policy or at worst an accommodation of it through lip service\n\n\nThis is tertiary level\n\n\nOn the one hand respondents perceived that Pilipino can be a language of unity or national identity\n\n\nIt may be pointed out however that one can be a nationalist even without communicating in Pilipino\n\n\nI had a long argument last night with some of my relatives about this language policy", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood morning everybody\n\n\nI 'm sorry I 'm late, \n\n\nUhm my topic is on creative therapy, and uh when they told me about this topic, I had to think really hard because uh, sometimes when you practice for a while you don't any more uh you know reflect on what you 're doing\n\n\nIt 's sort of like it comes and sometimes I think to myself that when I face a particular patient, I 'm not really the one there you see I 'm just an instrument\n\n\nSo it more or less has a lot to do with uh being open  'no  \n\n\nYou open yourself to, to the patient and whatever it is that the patient says to you\n\n\nSo uh when you when you decide to do therapy with a patient unlike when I initially started as a therapist that I was very careful about referring to specific uh theoretical models\n\n\nWhat happens is I don't know which comes first\n\n\nIs it the theoretical model\n\n\nIs it the experience that I have\n\n\nIs it me\n\n\nIs it the patient or is it uh, is it enlightenment from above you know\n\n\nSo I decided to really sit down and think about think about uh what it is that that a person does\n\n\nI think that after a certain time all of you without knowing it you become creative,  'no  \n\n\nWhat stimulates the creativity primarily I think is the desperation that you sense from your patient and you don't really have very much time to reflect uh on it it 's like you respond automatically  'no  to the patient\n\n\nSo uhm, I I sort of look back into my, my notes and I said to myself uh maybe the best thing for me to do is really sit down and systematically show you, uhm the various things that that goes through that that goes through the process of of uh doing therapy with a patient\n\n\nI 'm only speaking for for myself  'no  \n\n\nAnd I think I have, sort of referred this to some of my colleagues  Doktora  Ruiz is one of them  'no  so I I don't know if you 'll agree  'no  \n\n\nFirst of all I 'd like to define what the meaning of \" therapist \" is, for me\n\n\nFor me a therapist is a healer, specifically a therapist is a healer of the psyche, of the soul if you want to call it or of the spirit\n\n\nAnd the spirit or the soul or the psyche has been wounded uh and the wounds come from human conditions, \n\n\nAnd so uh by the very nature of the psychic wound, uh the therapist must explore the realm of the unseen  'no  of the abstract of the symbolic\n\n\nSo most of the time it 's intangible and uh, that 's the reason why, uh in my work in the hospital I work with psychiatry residents and these people these medical residents have spent twelve years of their lives working with the concrete\n\n\nIn other words they work on the human body\n\n\nSo they know all about the circulatory system all about the nervous system all about the digestive and the reproductive system\n\n\nThey know that very well and then suddenly they enter the world of psychiatry, where there is where you are required to make a dramatic shift from the concrete to the abstract, \n\n\nNeedless to say it becomes a very difficult task for a medical student who has always been hands on on the physical to suddenly shift  'no  and go to the abstract process\n\n\nSo I think for me working with psychiatry residents the first year is the most difficult wherein there is a shift from the concrete to the abstract\n\n\nThe concrete is now just symptomatic because you are more concerned with the abstract process or what the unseen what you don't see really  'no  \n\n\nI don't find that as difficult when I work with uh psychology uh students they seem to automatically shift  'no  into the abstract process, or let 's say the symbolic process or what is unseen by the naked eye\n\n\nSo that that that 's those are the two things that that that uh really strike me\n\n\nIt 's by the nature of your own training, \n\n\nAlso I think, no matter what a person says or no matter what people say that you can become a therapist, I also think, that you cannot force yourself to be a therapist\n\n\nYou must already have been one, maybe unfinished or there must have been that must be your gift from the beginning  'no  \n\n\nSo some of you might have known from early childhood that you could see certain things that other people cannot see I 'm not talking \" psychic \"  'no  \n\n\nYou can see uh you can sense that somebody is hurting, whereas perhaps your brother or your sister tells you oh you it 's all in your mind \n\n\nYou know what I mean\n\n\nYou can sense it\n\n\nYou can pick up sadness  'no  \n\n\nYou can pick up conflict\n\n\nBut you don't have those terms but you already have that gift\n\n\nSo coming into a more professional training what they try to do or what the institutions try to do is they just try to give you uh, systematic ways of figuring out how it is that you are sensing this  'no  \n\n\nAnd sometimes I don't know if that 's good or bad\n\n\nWhen you take a P H D as I 'm telling my class you end up pressured harassed and depressed  okay\n\n\nSo in other words you 're so pressured  kasi  to memorize all of these various theories\n\n\nAnd you 're so harassed because you have these fifty thousand papers okay\n\n\nAnd you 're so depressed because you 're not giving yourself enough time to reflect on what you 're doing and if you are a therapist you are a natural reflector  'no  \n\n\nSo sometimes you just want to sit down and say to yourself wait a minute what 's happening to me \n\n\nAnd for me that is what a therapist is all about for as long as you 're working with someone else\n\n\nIt 's not only that someone else that you 're dealing with you 're also dealing with your own, \n\n\nHow am I reacting to this\n\n\nAm I interpreting this person 's issues because of my own issues or what  'no  \n\n\nSo there 's a constant interplay between you and your client\n\n\nSo you might have a person who is fantastically trained, in psychoanalysis, but that person is not anything for the client because that  that analyst never interacted never gave of himself  'no  \n\n\nSo more than that creative therapy I think is the ability to be able to touch the other person in a healing way, and at the same time allowing that person to touch you and to make you grow\n\n\nNeedless to say I think what happens is  somewhere along the way most therapists get burned out,  'no  \n\n\nI think anybody who 's in a helping profession gets burned out\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause I think our tendency is always to look to the needs of others and forget our own needs, \n\n\nSo hopefully creative therapy will be a way, of, getting your psychic perks  'no  by in your interaction with your patient as well as providing your patient uh with psychic perks  'no  \n\n\nSo by the very nature of the wounds that your specific client has in other words we get a lot of those kinds of people in the hospital they come in and they have a thorough check up and they have all sorts of doctors looking at them and then the doctors will say there 's nothing wrong with you you can go home \n\n\nAnd the clients and the patient says no I don't feel well, and then the doctor will come out and show all the results you see your blood is okay your x-ray is okay there 's nothing wrong with you\n\n\nGet out of that bed because we need it for somebody who 's really sick okay \n\n\nBut they don't know that this person is really sick\n\n\nIt is what you would call perhaps in the Bible \" sick in the spirit \" or what you would call \" experiencing the dark night of the soul \" \n\n\nAnd it is what perhaps what uhm what you would say not in the presence of if you are spiritual not in the presence of God 's grace or someone who has shut himself completely from any kind of uh, interaction\n\n\nIn other words that person has become stagnant inside  'no  \n\n\nSo how do you say that how do you put that in a chart\n\n\nDear Dr So-and-So thank you for your kind referral\n\n\nMy diagnostic impression of this patient is that he is experiencing the dark night of the soul  \n\n\nOkay now what would happen to you is they would confine you in the psychiatric unit beside the patient that they referred to you\n\n\nSo you don't say that although at the back of your mind you know you just know\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause this person perhaps is manifesting certain kinds of behavior which even as a child you could already sense, \n\n\nI don't think there 's any one person in this room, who has not had, that kind of, call it what you will intuition sensing or whatever \n\n Even as a child they could feel the other person 's pain, \n\n\nSo, by the very nature of the wounds the therapist must consider several things\n\n\nYou have to have you can say oh I can feel you are in pain, nobody gives very much value to your feelings \n\n\nSo what they have tried to do I think uh as you go into higher education is they try to sort out manifestations of this pain\n\n\nAnd so what is the main manifestation of of this particular pain in your patient or this particular conflict, \n\n\nThat is what you are studying now\n\n\nThat is what you would call the behavioral symptoms\n\n\nSo we are very attuned to behavioral symptoms\n\n\nUh examples of behavioral symptoms would probably be constant ticks you know like that or uhm, signs of uh restlessness or disorientation forgetfulness okay use of language\n\n\nHow do they use their language\n\n\nDo they do they speak in uh, a a gentle tone or do the words come out, very rough  'no  \n\n\nSo these are symptoms\n\n\nAnd other behavioral symptoms probably would be if you go a little further a person can no longer use his right hand, although neurologically and muscularly he can he 's supposed to, okay but he can't use it anymore\n\n\nUhm, aches and pains that have no pattern  'no  \n\n\nSo a person has an ache here an ache here okay notice usually if there 's an ache it 's all on one side that 's supposed to be the pattern\n\n\nBut you have people who have aches and pains all over their body and if you suggest you have a pain here yes doctor there too  \n\n\nOkay so in other words whatever you suggest there 's pain\n\n\nSo you are able to pinpoint that sort of thing\n\n\nAlso you have to pay behavioral symptoms pain symptoms language symptoms voice tone okay\n\n\nYou know that very well in neurolinguistic programming  'no  \n\n\nIs the person auditory visual kinesthetic\n\n\nThose things you take into consideration too, okay\n\n\nWhat are all these symptoms uh, \n\n For, for the therapist these symptoms are nothing more but the expression of the patient 's conflicts anguish frustrations and anxieties okay which John of the Cross summed up as \" the dark night of the soul \" okay\n\n\nTake for example a man, who all his life has always done the right thing upright, \n\n\nI just had this kind of patient a couple of months ago\n\n\nHe has always done the right thing\n\n\nHe has always abided by the rules\n\n\nHe has always been the ideal husband and father, \n\n\nThen one day his wife 's mother died and so she had to go back to the province and she brought her children with her but he could not go because he had to work in Manila\n\n\nThe man is forty-three years old, okay\n\n\nTwo months later when his wife came back, he sat down and he told his wife I no longer love you and I don't want to live with you anymore\n\n\nI want you and the children to pack up your bags and go back to the province \n\n\nAnd so the wife said what did I do \n\n\nI mean you know was I a bad wife \n\n\nNo you were not a bad wife, \n\n\nThen what is it \n\n\nI just don't feel for you anymore, \n\n\nAnd so the children of course reacted and what did they say what kind of a father are you\n\n\nYou 're not the person we know\n\n\nOur mother is so good \n\n\nAnd so it became a family problem\n\n\nBut actually what was the problem was this man, \n\n\nSuddenly he had to confront aspects of his life which he thought he had overcome many many years ago by being very strict with himself, okay\n\n\nSo the wife said there must be another woman \n\n\nAnd then he said no there 's no other woman \n\n\nThen there must be another man  okay\n\n\nThen he says he says no there 's no other man \n\n\nSo I I came across this man not because he was my patient the children the children were my patients because the wife was saying that the children were acting up\n\n\nSo they would manipulate ways and means of getting him to come\n\n\nSo finally when he came he said he just doesn't feel anything for anyone\n\n\nHe just wants to quit everything\n\n\nHe wants to quit his job\n\n\nHe wants to quit his family\n\n\nHe wants to quit everything okay\n\n\nBut the wife is such a formidable person that she said I am not going to quit, I am not going to give you up without a fight \n\n\nAnd the husband said you can fight with your own shadow because I am not going to be there",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWhere is your president\n\n\nMr President, fellow inventors ladies and gentlemen\n\n\nAt one of the occasions uh I was invited to, after uh addressing the crowd uh a man sprang up and asked a question with certain degree of enthusiasm and said why did you address us uh fellow inventors \n\n\nThen I shoot uh another question how many children do you have and he said I have eight \n\n\nOh my God you are as good a prolific inventor as I am but I uhm I mean you are more prolific than I am I have only two, \n\n\nMy point really is that, everybody is an inventor in his own right\n\n\nRight\n\n\nPerhaps you have invented so many alibis  and justifications for coming late at night because of such uh an exciting date\n\n\nBut if we agree that uh necessity is a mother of invention then everybody 's necessity has to be addressed with certain degree of inventiveness, \n\n\nAt any rate before we go on inventing let me just briefly tell you about the Filipino Inventors Society\n\n\nIn nineteen forty-three during the war, a group of true blooded, Filipino nationalists grouped together to organize the Filipino Inventors Society at a time when imports were curtailed you know that uh if the war is uh ongoing freedom halted, \n\n\nAnd so the Society was formed if only to address the promotion and development of local inventive capabilities, \n\n\nSo along that direction the Filipino Inventors Society was able to lobby and uh Congress approved the then known as Republic Act number thirty-eight fifty and then later was amended by  Apo  Ferdie Marcos by P D, fourteen twenty- three to be responsive to the need of our so-called technological requirements\n\n\nRegrettably, under the current administration I don't know who of you are pro or cons especially the treaty, the Republic Act number was abolished\n\n\nThat would include the tax exemptions that we were enjoying\n\n\nThat would include the funds that supported the development of crazy ideas, \n\n\nYou know ideas have to be prototype to make it you know make it to make them workable demonstrable and then perhaps convert that into economic realities, \n\n\n Yun ang nakakalungkot  \n\n\n Kung baga ako may trauma kahit na kasama ako sa EDSA  \n\n\n Dahil nung panahon ni Apo  the Filipino inventors were given  kahit na consuelo de bobo mayron din  \n\n\nTo tell you frankly we were given enough support we were holding, regular  week in which contests were held and for which Presidential Awards were given including the international awards of the World Intellectual Property Organization under the U N system\n\n\nBut under this current predicament we have been plagued by what, the doom of the referendum the  lahar  the Mount Pinatubo the quake the flood\n\n\nWhy is this country cursed\n\n\nOh my God almighty have mercy upon us, \n\n\nWhat is happening to this country ladies and gentlemen\n\n\nFor the last fifty years we have stagnated\n\n\nImmediately after the war we were only said to be second to Japan\n\n\nBut what is our  per capita  income now\n\n\nIt 's about seven thousand dollars  vis a vis  Japanese twenty-two thousand dollars much higher than the U S twenty-one thousand, \n\n\nThis is very regrettable\n\n\nThen we have to address this\n\n\nAnd we have to ask questions like why have we stagnated\n\n\nThe following statements will give some  unassailable answers\n\n\nLet me read to you so that I 'll not get lost\n\n\n In seventeen ninety the President of the United States George Washington during the inauguration of Philippine Patent Office said  the advancement of agriculture trade and industrial manufacture with all appropriate measures may not need a special recommendation but I cannot refrain from pointing out to you the necessity of effectively encouraging introduction of inventions from abroad as well as the skills and genius at home for the production of these inventions   \n\n\nMr <unclear> name </unclear> an attorney-at-law head of the Japanese and Far East Department Max Planck Institute Munich Federal Germany he said  industrial property as an element of national industrial strategy , \n\n\nHe said uhm averred in his paper  regardless of development or growth economics regardless of whether you have a developing or industrialized country or regardless of which branches of industry a given industrial strategy strategy focuses on one factor that is essential to all was essential for sustained high growth in Korea and Taiwan is technological progress  \n\n\nWerner von Siemens the inventor of the telephone that we are using now perhaps whose efforts were decisive for the adoption of patent protection in Germany he added  national interest and national industry must come first because patent law was established so that industry should develop not for the inventor himself to make money or especially good profit that, is only secondary\n\n\n Our industry shall blossom and progress for this inventive activity is necessary not for itself   \n\n\nMr Takasha Takashi Tahakashi Korikyu of Japan founder of the Japanese Industrial Property System he said  pasensiyahin mo yung  English  ng Hapon  we have looked about and see what nations are greatest so that we can be like them \n\n\nAnd he  and he said uhm what is it that makes the United States such a great nation and we investigated and found that it was patents meaning inventions, and so we will have patents \n\n\nAnd look at Japan now\n\n\nOf course the organization of which the Filipino Inventors Society is a member Mel said uh a voting member yes and the United Nations uh World Intellectual Property said  industrial progress and prosperity are to a large extent heavily dependent upon the inventors  \n\n\n The significance of the inventors becomes overwhelmingly, evident when we consider a situation had many of the great  inventions never been made  \n\n\nThe latest uh statement I have gathered the U S claims to a foundation Educational Foundation of Inventors quote our inventors are the single greatest national resource unquote\n\n\nThese are some statements which perhaps can address the question, we asked earlier\n\n\nAnd in this uh in the country we have uh a very, active uh secretary then of President Marcos and I have been overwhelmingly fascinated by his uh  popularized phrase\n\n\nAnd he said innovate or stagnate \n\n\nSo at least you know now why we have stagnated, \n\n\nIf we  venture to say that the government has failed to employ the invention or the technological inputs into its economic agenda then it is a sign it is a reflection that will tell us, perhaps it 's indifference or outright ignorance of putting the invention into the industrialization process\n\n\n Alam mo , don't uh be malice about this you know the government has been embarking on industrialization thrust\n\n\n Ang sabi ko sa Bisaya , we can never  industrialize I tell you we can never industrialize\n\n\n So sinabi ko sa Bisaya patuli ako uli papatuli akog utru kung makakamot makamtan nato ang industriyalisasyon sa  the year two thousand\n\n\nI don't have to interpret that in Tagalog anymore because  namimilipit yung dila ko  \n\n\nIt is sad to state ladies and gentlemen, that our government has been inventive I tell you, has been inventive\n\n\nLook at the invention of the Garchitorena scam, the graft and corruption, the two billion PAL scandal, the  borloloy , the Lear jet\n\n\n Alam mo binili raw ng Amerikano e ay  seven million  e  dollars  pero ang dini-clare ay  five million  lang  \n\n\n Nung bumalik dito ang sinisingil ay  seven million  nahalata tuloy  \n\n\nI think uh at the very late I mean lately I think you have not that lately uhm you have perhaps seen some T V pluggings no during the time of Joe Con\n\n\n Alam mo yung  background  dun  is the song of uh Ninoy Aquino  yung  favorite favorite  niya yung  the Impossible Dream, \n\n\n Baka nangangarap lang tayo nananaginip tayo sa ating industriyalisasyon  without the aid of science and technology\n\n\nIt 's uh  nakakalungkot no  \n\n\nIt 's a sad thing that uh why this government has not been able to establish a strong science and technology policy\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nWhy the private sector perhaps like you has not been able to address that problem of science and technology as one single economic factor because if we have to industrialize we should employ technological innovations or inventions\n\n\nThere is nothing else there is no way else that we can industrialize without the aid of science and technology, \n\n\nSo additionally, the Filipino Inventors Society has been aggressive to restore what was abolished by Execution Order one two eight I mean Executive Order one two eight that abolished the incentives\n\n\nThere is now the  the Senate Bill seventeen  uh seventeen fifty-eight which embodies the ten year tax exemption for inventors who may be able to to to commercialize an invention a fifty million guarantee fund but this bill is still pending in the Senate\n\n\nThere is also the House Bill three three eight seven which would make the Filipino Inventors Society as a chartered organization, \n\n\nAs a chartered organization it can now enjoy tax exemption corporate tax and perhaps customs duties to be free if an import would complement the R and D activity of the Filipino Inventors Society\n\n\nLet me mention some Filipino inventions for your information which have uh   uhm gone into some kind of a world fame but uh\n\n\nI know you know Rizal\n\n\nHe was the first to invent the  the block-making machine that could produce at that time six thousand blocks a day\n\n\nI don't know if you are aware of that\n\n\nThen he invented a cigarette that he gifted to Dr Blumentritt and other friends at the age of nine\n\n\nAnd then he made a some kind of invention an irrigation system that only made with uh was made with bare hands and some innovations that irrigated his autarchic republic within the republic during his exile in Dapitan  'no  \n\n\nHe he collected about three hundred forty-three conchology items,  'no  \n\n\nAnd then he invented some equipment for bakery making biscuits among others\n\n\nAnd so I think from the very from the very history of the Filipinos the inventive gene has been there\n\n\nThat 's why I call you inventors uh, in your own right\n\n\nTake a look at the fluorescent lamp this is documented\n\n\nDuring the time of Quezon this was presented by Agapito Flores to to the President\n\n\nBut uh  wala ngang alam e ng  invention  di mayro'n mayroong  certain diplomatic visitor there who was interested  doon sa kumukuti-kutitap uh nakikita niya e  \n\n\nAnd so he brought uh Agapito Flores in the U S and it was further developed and perfected there\n\n\nAnd so it was known flores-cent lamp\n\n\nLook at also the Moonbuggy\n\n\nOne of the aggressive designers was Ed San Juan\n\n\nDuring the time of Marcos he came over and we presented him a plaque of appreciation\n\n\nHe died two years ago, in the luxury of wealth at the NASA\n\n\nLook at the signal light  yung sa yung sa kotse baka hindi ninyo alam yan  \n\n\nIt was patented by a Filipino in nineteen twenty-one in the United States  'no  \n\n\n Kaliwa kanan kaliwa kanan ha  by Buncio William Buncio\n\n\nThe T V telephone association it was demonstrated in nineteen sixty-seven between the  the Development Board office at Herran and Malaca&ntilde;ang during the time of President Garcia\n\n\nIt was done by Dr Greg Sara\n\n\nThe multivitamins and and many other inventions but the recent one the sing-along system was copied everywhere else\n\n\nThis was originated by then president Roberto del Rosario  'yung sa Trebel 'no  \n\n\nIn fact he has invented a new a new tape colored tape\n\n\n Yung mga paos yung mga sintonado pwede nang kumanta  \n\n\nBelieve me  'no kakanta kayo pwede na  \n\n\n Tatlong kulay yun na-  distinguish  yung kulay ng boses nyo  \n\n\n Sabi ko nga hindi yan  colored tape  kung hindi  voice range  uh voice range finder\n\n\nAt any rate, unless we do something about our inventors this is quite uh self-pity but I have to say with all candor from within my heart\n\n\nUnless we do something with our inventive capabilities and put this into the vortex of economic strategizing we will never never industrialize\n\n\n Ang sabi ni Concepcion  we have there is already an investment to as much as three billion dollars or three hundred billion dollars in the country\n\n\nWhat three hundred billion dollars\n\n\nDo you think that is an industrialization per se\n\n\nNever\n\n\nBecause this capital siphoned in would only exploit your skills and my labors our natural resources\n\n\nAnd what is foremost is the repatriation of income\n\n\nPerhaps  hindi pa magbabayad ng  income  sa atin  \n\n\nAnd that would tend to exploit rather than industrialize our country\n\n\nSo unless we do something about this we would be left singing  to dream the impossible dream to reach the unreachable star no matter how hopeless  \n\n\nThen the N I C or the new industrialization program of  Tita  Cory  administration will never be as good a dream as a nightmare\n\n\nThank you very much  \n\n\nOkay  as per international statistics the ratio between success and failure is anywhere from ninety-five to  ninety-seven failure only three to five percent success\n\n\nRemember Thomas Edison when he was experimenting on one of the items, uhm,   sinabi do'n sa boy uh ang nagreklamo yung boy e sabi niya 'yun boy eh  uhm Sir  sagad na  \n\n\n Do'n sa  calibration  'no  \n\n\nUh that was the that was the limit according to the boy", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood afternoon everyone  \n\n\nUhm I 'm actually scheduled to do I was supposed to read <unclear> 3 words </unclear> \n\n\nFor a monk who does not who should remain in a life of silence\nI speak a great deal  especially on occasions when I 'm outside the monastery uh \n\n So uh I actually prepared two lectures because they asked for \" A Question of Heroes \" and I felt it would be appropriate to deal with the the two major heroes Andres Bonifacio and Jose Rizal\n\n\nDepends if we will have time for the second one\n\n\nUhm I decided to speak first on Andres Bonifacio simply because eighteen ninety-seven is his centennial year\n\n\nWe are celebrating  we 're not supposed to celebrate it but uhm this is one reason why Bonifacio Centennial unlike Rizal last year there was such a lot of things going on re-enactment <unclear> word </unclear> stamps coins contests uhm even kite flying  and they had all sorts of things last year for Jose Rizal\n\n\nBut for Andres Bonifacio we could not celebrate it uh simply because uh May ten eighteen ninety-seven a hundred years ago uh he was killed in the mountains of Maragondon Cavite by uh fellow Filipinos\n\n\nI mean uh with Rizal Rizal was killed by Spaniards that 's fine  \n\n\nUh Bonifacio was killed by fellow Filipinos that 's not it 's not something you want to remember uh but since uh we are dealing with uh history and I think if uh Pepe Diokno were alive he would 've liked to listen to something that we sweep under the rug and uh Bonifacio unfortunately is one of the heroes we like to remember but we only remember bits and pieces of him so the  history  you will hear this afternoon uh is kind of shocking in some parts \n\n It is uh it is something I wish I did not see anymore and uh I would have been happy just dealing with what my teachers and my textbooks told me then\n\n\nOf course it is uh one of the tasks of a historian to present truth even if half the time that truth is not popular or might even be painful for people\n\n\nSo uhm people usually assume uh that I spend most of my time researching in libraries or archives or  date matching  \n\n I 'm always at my desk which seems like an easy life\n\n\nI mean in my monastery for example some of the Brothers cannot understand why I spend half the day in front of my computer so for them they don't think it is quote unquote \" work \" because \" work \" means leaving at eight o'clock going to an office and coming back at five\n\n\nSo if you sit in your room half the day reading uh half the time sleeping  uh actually I 'd rather think that is reflection   'no  uh or resting in the Lord but then uh the Brothers are not so keen on that\n\n\nUh what many people actually do not see is the heavy burden that responsible historians carry on their backs and even if we think eighteen ninety-six and eighteen ninety-eight something to be celebrated there is very much underneath the glorious trappings that is a very painful cancer to Filipinos who seriously look into their past\n\n\nPersonally eighteen ninety-six is a very distressing part of our history and if I did not have the great misfortune of being both a historian and a journalist I would rather sweep it under a rug than talk about it\n\n\nAt the time Andres Bonifacio began the Philippine revolution in Balintawak in the latter part of August eighteen ninety-six because we 're still fighting over the dates uh little did he know that he would be swallowed up by the very revolution that he started\n\n\nThis is the greatest irony of Andres Bonifacio\n\n\nBonifacio was killed by the very revolution he started\n\n\nThis is our first painful lesson for this afternoon\n\n\nUnless we come to terms with this part of our history we will never get anywhere and you remember the proverb   ang hindi marunong lumingon sa pinanggalingan tae ang maaapakan    or again as <unclear> words </unclear>  in order to foretell the destiny of a nation one has first to open the book of her past  \n\n\nNow one of the main problems is that Philippine history is sadly written by rather dull and uh rather mediocre people  \n\n\nWe have uh many textbooks but we don't have interesting books of history\n\n\nUhm if you go to a bookstore and this is not well uh my books are not very serious you don't have something that every interested  Pinoy  must know \n\n All you have are these thick books with dates and names but the thing is history is not just this accumulation of data\n\n\nIt must be presented in good and lively writing and it must give a point of view for without it history is a story without meaning\n\n\nOne of the main problems facing Filipinos is our terribly short memory\n\n\nUh the fact that Imelda and Imee Marcos sit in Congress is a very great proof of that\n\n\nWe have very little or no historical sense at all and it does not help that our historians cannot get their act together\n\n\nThe end result is that Philippine history is often confused and confusing\n\n\nSo this is one example\n\n\nLast year we had a roundtable discussion in the University of the Philippines\n\n\nWell I call it the <unclear> 2 words </unclear>  \n\n\nUhm we had this uh roundtable for a whole day in the hope of resolving this fifty-five year controversy of where and when the first cry of the revolution occurred\n\n\nIs it Balintawak or is it Pugadlawin\n\n\nIs it August twenty-three eighteen ninety-six or August twenty-six eighteen ninety-six\n\n\nSo I was invited to react to uh one of the papers presented on the forum because three years ago I wrote two essays on the thing and I could not resolve it either \n\n And to be rather flippant I just teachers and students keep writing or interviewing me can you give us a definite answer \n\n \n\n\nSo the thing is they couldn't quite understand it\n\n\nI think personally that the controversy is like the controversy of the first Mass\n\n\nUh where was it held\n\n\nWas it in Limasawa or is it Masau Butuan\n\n\nAnd of course being a monk I think I should be interested in it but I always tell my students we shouldn't even discuss that at all\n\n\nIt should be thrown in the  basura  and it shouldn't even be in textbooks at all because uh if you know what a galleon was like they were having Mass every day so we really do not know when this first Mass was held  and come to think of it so much precious time is wasted on something which is so uh well it 's important but it 's not very very important\n\n\nSo anyway getting back to this roundtable conference we began at nine o'clock in the morning with only two options Balintawak or Pugadlawin\n\n\nBy the time we adjourned at five in the afternoon we had more questions than answers  \n\n\nAs an added bonus we all left with a very big headache because at after from nine to five uh we started with Balintawak and Pugadlawin but we ended up with Bahay Toro Kangkong Pasong Tamo <unclear> words </unclear> Pugad ng Lawin and Pakpak Lawin  and  ano pa  \n\n\nAnd one of the light moments was when one of the scholars said it was  Pugad Baboy   \n\n\nSo then uh it was not only that\n\n\nSo we started at nine o'clock with two things August twenty-three August twenty-six eighteen ninety-six that was before lunch\n\n\nBy late afternoon we had the following dates August twenty twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six and to top it all someone even suggested a wild card in <unclear> 1 word </unclear> September  \n\n\nI mean you know uh this did not faze me uh this was nothing new \n\n Uh then somebody said uh since we can't settle that let 's settle something else they said \n\n \n\n\nAnd then uh then there was another debate there\n\n\nSo somebody said you know in Spanish it 's  grito de  Balintawak like  grito de  something in Mexico and Cuba so it is we shouldn't take it literally you know described so uh rather we should see it symbolically as the beginning of the  revolution so it 's a figure of speech  etcetera etcetera  \n\n\nSo then later on what happened was somebody said there was no shout at all there were two shouts somebody said  \n\n\nSomebody said there was one shout and then  sige na  let 's leave that  na lang  \n\n\nSo let 's uh do other things  na lang  \n\n\nSo uh after this so we talked about other things and then uh somebody he brought up what Bonifacio was like and uh uh we when you look at a statue of Bonifacio today what do you see\n\n\nYou see him wearing a  kamisa de chino  that 's open here and you can see his muscular chest  and then uh he 's always with his red  kundiman  pants and then he 's holding a bolo and he 's always angry he 's always shouting or he 's mad or uh whatever\n\n\nUh a few months ago I talked for example to the daughter of Gregoria de Jesus uh Bonifacio 's widow and then she said uh look at those  kundiman  pants and I said yes yes that 's what 's in all the statues and then she said you know adults do not wear  kundiman  pants only children wear those pants <&> audience laughs  \n\n \n\n And then I said no no you try your best to camouflage yourself you 're a moving target there \n\n\nSo it occurred to me I started thinking of other things \n\n Did he really fight with the bolo\n\n\nEveryone is so upset now when I tell them that although he 's always brandishing his bolo Bonifacio never fought with the bolo\n\n\nThe preferred weapon was always a gun and the thing was when he went to uh Balintawak in August of eighteen ninety-six this scandalizes everyone he went to Balintawak dressed as a woman  because it was he could not pass through all the sentries so Andres Bonifacio tied his uh bandanna on his head and he wore a woman 's dress and of course he cannot travel in a woman 's dress carrying his big bolo  \n\n\nUh so what he did was he kept the bolo in <unclear> place name </unclear> and brought his gun uh which is why uh we find out later that his preferred weapon was a bolo\n\n\nSo you see every day everywhere you will see images of Bonifacio which are historically inaccurate but then that is the image that we see in our textbooks in pictures in  plazas  in everywhere  'no  \n\n\nSo uh what what really happened \n\n \n\n\nSomebody said there was no such thing maybe they didn't tear any  cedula  and then somebody said no there 's a source that says they tore their cedulas twice and I said how can you tear a  cedula  twice in three two different areas\n\n\nUh people found that strange until later on I found a document that showed that Andres Bonifacio was using fake  cedulas  which means he probably had half a dozen on himself", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "41488763-d1b4-4269-b2c2-2f30b14a0dd5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.204228+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\n And the regular polymer that you see around okay\n\n\nWhy you can look at it you can feel it you can touch it but don't\nturn it , \n\n\nNow there was a bit of uneasy concern on my part when I was\nrequested to give a talk about the role of polymers in the environment\n\n\nBut after hearing some of the speeches and reading articles on\npolymers I thought that this talk would be timely enough so as to clear a lot\nof biases that most people have about polymers in general and plastic in\nparticular\n\n\nNow as a polymer, now as a scientist we usually measure progress\nin terms of technology and the amount of innovation we introduce\n\n\nAnd on the other hand as an environmentalist we would like to use\nthese innovations and technology in order to better, if not maintain a\nbalance between polymers and the environment\n\n\nNow the main concern or one of the main questions we would like to\nanswer at the end of this talk is have we maintained a balance between\npolymer technology and, environment\n\n\nOr are we tilting the scale way towards technology\n\n\nIf so are we trying to do something in order to bring back the\nbalance between polymers technology and innovation and the environment\n\n\nSo hopefully at the end of the talk you 'll be enlightened enough\nand you can answer that question, \n\n\nNow as I 've mentioned before polymers at present has affected our\nday-to-day activities\n\n\nMost of the conveniences that we enjoy now are due to polymers\n\n\nIf we refer back to this century as the atomic age then the next\ngeneration can aptly be called as the polymer generation since by that time\neach and every facet of our lives will be influenced by polymers\n\n\nNow it is a sad fact though that students get out of the university\nwith having the barest knowledge of polymers\n\n\nNow this same indifference can be seen even during the early\nbeginnings of polymers\n\n\nIt was in eighteen thirty-nine when the Goodyear  \nbrothers Charles and Nelson transformed natural rubber and vulcanized it and\nformed as a formed a more thermoset material that we use now\n\n\nAnd one of the products that is being used uh that came out of this\ninnovation is the  ebonite which is used as bowling balls\n\n\nNow we have tires automobile tires\n\n\nAnd after Goodyear 's inventions and even before world war first\npolymers were considered more of an art and an empirical formula rather than\na science\n\n\nSo in the field of polymer science art precedes more than or\nprecedes that of the science\n\n\nFor almost a century polymers had been used and commercialized but\nit was only after forty years when polymers were taken seriously and\ndeveloped as a science\n\n\nIt was also  during those last forty years that polymers\nexperienced a tremendous growth in science and technology\n\n\nOne of the, one of the forebears of polymers science is\nStaudinger\n\n\nNow  Staudinger laid the groundwork towards an\ngroundwork of polymer as a science and at the time that he was working on on\nthe concept of science he was advised by his colleague and I quote  \ndear colleague leave the concept of large molecules well alone there can be\nno such thing as a molecule as a macro molecule  \n\n\nNow getting this kind of of letter or advice from your peers is a\nbig turndown especially in the field of science\n\n\nBut in the year nineteen twenty Staudinger was able to demonstrate\nthat natural and synthetic polymers are not aggregates like colloids or\ncyclic compounds like cyclohexane but are long chain-like molecules with\ncharacteristic and groups\n\n\nNow Staudinger went on to win a Nobel Prize\n\n\nNow what are polymers then and what makes them different and unique\nfrom regular compounds\n\n\nNow I brought some visual aids in here, \n\n\nNow according to composition we can classify polymers either as\naddition polymers,, okay, \n\n\nNow I pick a necklace bead in here and addition polymers okay are\nmade up of the same kind of beads same sizes all throughout\n\n\nNow polymers can range in length it could be short, like this or\nit can be real long, \n\n\nNow you can, you can form longer monomer polymers if you want\nby connecting one specific, polymer to another polymer as what I 'm doing\nright now, \n\n\nOkay, \n\n\nSo you can have one polymer chain and mix it this one up with\nanother polymer chain and form longer and longer polymer chain\n\n\nNow you can make a lot of structures out of this\n\n\nIn fact one of the common inventions that are being done right now\nor what we call the structural polymers you can make stars out of them, \n\n \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nNow you can make ladder polymers out of them\n\n\nIt looks like a ladder, \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nHere we go it 's not perfect but it looks like a ladder\n\n\nAnd you can make comb-like polymers out of them\n\n\nYou can make all the structures you want to make out of polymers\n\n\nNow there 's another kind of polymer which you can observe\n\n\nTake a look at this\n\n\nNow you have different sizes of the bead\n\n\nWe have small sizes this is the big one <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nNow this kind of polymers can also be made\n\n\nNow here 's a more uniform kind of polymer\n\n\nWe have an alternating small big and small beads in here\n\n\nAnd this is another kind of addition polymers\n\n\nNow condensation polymers are those polymers you prepare using two\ndifferent kinds of monomers\n\n\nSo if I have this purple one and I mix it with the yellow one then\nwe end up with what you call condensation polymers\n\n\nNow what is the importance of using addition and condensation\npolymers\n\n\nNow it depends upon the end use\n\n\nSo polymers in general are prepared in order to satisfy the\nconsumers\n\n\nNow according to structure okay according to structure we can\nclassify polymers into three different kinds\n\n\nWe can have the elastomers or rubber okay\n\n\nThis is what came out from natural rubber\n\n\nIt 's it 's not so sturdy you can break it you stretch it a little\nbit and you break it\n\n\nWhat Goodyear did was vulcanize this and form a little bit more\nstrong rubber\n\n\nNow another one, now some of the examples of, polymers we\n, okay, \n\n\nI mentioned earlier elastomers and the natural rubber for the\nchemist\n\n\nThey are otherwise known as the <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n\nNow we have neoprene which is polychlorophene they are used for\nautomobile parts\n\n\nNow we have <unclear> word </unclear> in rubber or known as\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> S and <unclear> word </unclear> S is the one that\nyou use for automobile tires\n\n\nNow we have polydimethoxyethylene that 's our silicon rubber\n\n\nAnd silicon rubber are the one used for biochemical or for purposes\nbecause for purposes of uh biological parts because silicon is biologically\ncompatible so heart valves okay ahm, contact lenses are example of poly uh\nxylene\n\n\nNow we also have polyalkaline sulfide otherwise known as xylopol\nand chlorosulfinated polyethylene or Hypalon\n\n\nNow for fibers you can have cotton wool and silk which are\nsynthetic fibers\n\n\nAnd the first uh these are <unclear> word </unclear> or natural\nfibers\n\n\nAnd the first synthetic fiber we have is nylon six-six\n\n\nNow this was uh synthetically prepared I think in the year nineteen\nthirty-six pretty close and we have polyethylene dacron and acetate rayon\n\n\nNow the last three have played a very important role especially in\nthe aerospace industry, \n\n\nOkay all of you have seen this one okay you 've seen a picture of a\nspaceman walking in the on the moon and, wearing a heavy suit\n\n\nNow this suit is made up of reinforced nylon composites\n\n\nAnd what they put in there is are what <unclear> word </unclear> we\nhave alkylated uh polyethylene and the purpose of that is you don't want it\nto get burned okay\n\n\nNow they 're made up of different layers and rather uncomfortable\n\n\nWhat they 're trying to do right now is to move towards polymers\nwhich are lightweight and and examples of these are what we call the acetates\nor the polyacetates\n\n\nOkay now here 's your uh space mobile okay\n\n\nAnd, you have very few metallic parts in here most of the metal\nparts that you see in there are just used to hold the structure together\n\n\nNow most of them are made up of again reinforced composite light\npolyurethane and also <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n\nNow you can see an aluminum foil uh covering out of this\n\n\nThis is the module where uh, where this where this is the module\nwhere the scientists live okay\n\n\nThis is where they live during the space exploration\n\n\nAnd as you can see it 's not very convenient or tight packed in\nthere you can have only about five of them\n\n\nThe maximum is five if you have more of them then it will be very\nuncomfortable okay, \n\n\nNow this is uh this is the cabin where similar to the one that I 've\nshown you the first time and you can see that you have the mobile arm in\nthere\n\n\nThe mobile arm is the white one that comes out and this is where\nall the astronauts go through so it 's way way up in there it 's so small and\nall of them are made up of reinforced uh composites or polymers\n\n\nNow here is another picture of the mobile space mobile that I 've\nshown you before\n\n\nAnd okay all of these are placed inside your spacecraft and if you\nlook at the spacecraft they look like rubbery in form yes simply because they 're\nreally made up of reinforced rubber again in different layers, \n\n\nAnd this is when you scrape off the  the outer layer of\nthe spacecraft\n\n\nYou you scrape it off and look at what is in there\n\n\nYou can see that it 's made up of Plexiglass and Plexiglass is one\nof the more common structural materials we have\n\n\nUrethane is another one, \n\n\nNow, one of the innovation of polymer is computer okay\n\n\nWithout polymers there won't be any computers\n\n\nAnd as you can see this is the Kennedy Space Center with all the\n\n computers installed in there and what they do is monitor space\nexploration and every time they have airplanes or not airplanes spacecraft\nbeing sent in space, \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nNow the third third kind of polymer is the most visible kind and\nthose are the plastics\n\n\nAnd the plastics are made up of polyethylene and under this we\nhave the low density polyethylene the one that you use for packaging\n\n\nThis is an example of a low density polyethylene okay\n\n\nNow the high density polyethylene are the one that you use for\nmilk and juice bottles\n\n\nAnd the linear low density polyethylene are also used for\npackaging\n\n\nNow it 's  the linear the L L D P E are sturdier than\nthe linear poly  low density polyethylene\n\n\nSo we increase the tensile strength of the polymer by increasing\nthe or varying the proportion of these polyethylene uh polymers\n\n\nNow polystyrene is what you normally see every time you buy\nsomething from fast foods so you could go to McDonald or Wendy 's now you\nhave those uh we call them expanded polystyrene and those are made up uh by\nsimply getting your basic polystyrene and  trying to inject\ngaseous substances into it\n\n\nNow polyethylene terepthalate are what you see inside the bottles\n\n\nThere was a time that most of the drinks we have are in in bottles\nokay\n\n\nThose are easy to recycle but we 're shifting a little bit now\ninto plastic and that is when you have  polyethylene\nterepthalate uh being used more often\n\n\nNow the cover that they use for the soda bottle is made up of high\ndensity polyethylene\n\n\nNow if you come across the structure uh which is, glass-like\nokay it looks like plastic but it 's a little bit more glass-like that is\npolymethyl methacrylate okay or otherwise we know as Plexiglass or fiberglass\nas what you mentioned\n\n\nNow polyvinyl chloride is another polymer which is being used for\npackaging\n\n\nAnd polyoxymethylene is a polymer which is used for gaskets okay\n\n\nSo all of the polymers under plastic in there you 'll find out\nthat polyethylene polystyrene polymethylene terepthalate are the one actually\nthat is our main concern, \n\n\nThe visibility of plastics as a consumer item, and the\nmisconceived notion that we can do nothing to get rid of plastic safely has\nmade plastic subject to inordinate amount of attention and legislation\n\n\nThe alternatives given range from either recycling to outright ban\nof plastic packaging\n\n\nPeople 's biases towards plastic has subjected polymers as a whole\nunder critical scrutiny\n\n\nIn nineteen seventy-six the United Nations met in France and\nformally introduced a new concept in resource management and environmental\ncontrol\n\n\nNow this no-nonsense front end approach to environmental control\ninvolves minimizing resource input and effluent output even to the extent of\nrevamping and redesigning industrial processes and products\n\n\nNow for quite some time, this was met with indifference and\nbranded to be impractical expensive and idealistic", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "71a0f1ba-33ae-462b-b3b9-e1fb6abe1f02", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.205331+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\n Thank you very much\n\n\nTen thousand apologies\n\n\nIt was my fault\n\n\nI we  I had an interview with someone else and I didn't realize it was so late\n\n\nSo we actually left at five minutes to one\n\n\nAnd I want to thank the they were so good they were sitting there so quietly you know and I didn't know it was so late already uhm\n\n\nI 'm also happy this is the is this the first time  'no pala  this is the second time I 've entered La Salle\n\n\nThe other time was somewhere else just before EDSA I think it was\n\n\nSo I 'm happy to be here with you\n\n\nUhm actually I 've been turning down a lot of the offers for talks  requests for talks because I 've been so busy but I couldn't say no to you because uhm Our Lady 's message is directed specifically to the youth\n\n\nAnd it 's very important that you know this\n\n\nBecause even in Medjugorje she had one year that she called for all the youth to come\n\n\nAnd then the next year she had an extension and she 's calling the youth because this is a message that you probably hear sometimes when you graduate whether from high school or college or what\n\n\nAnd they 'll tell you you know the world is in your hands or you face a hall of life and you can do much to change what 's going to happen\n\n\nBut that 's precisely why she 's calling you because it is in your hands and you have to believe it\n\n\nYou have to believe it and you can take a hold of it you can grasp it\n\n\nIt is within your hands to change the world  in what it 's it 's it 's rushing head long to today\n\n\nAnd uhm I 'm very happy to hear that that you 're talking about the devil as if he really did exist because sometimes you know there are people who refuse to accept the existence of the devil\n\n\nI have had friends who have told me don't talk about the devil because it 's negative\n\n\nUh uh it 's it 's negative I don't want to upset my children and soon\n\n\nAnd that 's when he works the hardest and he works the best\n\n\nBut when you recognize that he does exist and that you are aware of how he will uh of how he makes use of you and of things of the world then you are already halfway there\n\n\nThe key is recognizing\n\n\nThat 's what 's happened to this world today\n\n\nAnd that 's what 's happened to the youth today\n\n\nYou see this world teaches you that the devil no longer exists is he or doesn't exist or never has existed\n\n\nThis world tells you in terms like positive thinking negative thinking etcetera and so on\n\n\nUh the old ways in which even we were brought up and raised in you know we were brought up and raised into the fact that hey you know there 's a bogeyman out there\n\n\nWell it 's true\n\n\nLet me tell you there 's a bogeyman out there and he 's working and he 's working with you he 's working with us\n\n\nThe first thing that he has set off to destroy is the family and even this our Lady has said very specifically in Medjugorje\n\n\nThe family is the first thing that the devil will attack\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause the family is supposed to be uh the haven for love for happiness security uh\n\n\nI think when I think of Jesus coming and I think of the fact that Jesus came uh as he did many people point out you see Jesus ' love for the poor because Jesus himself was poor\n\n\nThere 's a deeper message than that\n\n\nJesus came in a family\n\n\nJesus could have materialized out of nowhere could have walked out of the desert and started doing all of his miracles and they still would have happened\n\n\nBut Jesus chose to come in a family\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause he wanted to show us that that 's the most important unit uh in the world that exists\n\n\nThe most integral unit is the family\n\n\nIf you don't if you cannot if people who love each other can't even live together in love meaning giving accepting being kind and and so on to one another sacrificing for one another how much more can you expect to love your neighbor your classmate how much more can you accept uh other people who are not of the same cultural background\n\n\nAnd later on how can you expect other  to love other countries\n\n\nAnd so that 's what happened\n\n\nYou dissolve this integral unit of the family and everything else starts to follow\n\n\nAnd that 's exactly what is happening in the world today\n\n\nAnd now you have uh just as your professor has pointed out you have you have women who have taken on to themselves the duties if not the duties or the rights of God\n\n\nYou have young women who have taken on the rights to decide on life whether they can choose in other words they now have what they call they fight for the right of choice\n\n\nThe there are millions and millions of abortion that have been taking place in this last decade alone uh\n\n\nSomewhere in the scriptures it talks about how streets are running red with blood\n\n\nYou don't have to see it flowing on the streets\n\n\nThey 're running on the canals\n\n\nThey 're running in the canals of all the great cities of the world\n\n\nWhen I was in Korea to see the uh apparition that was happening there a priest a Belgian priest was telling me Sis you know here in Korea uh abortion has been legitimized by the government \n\n\nAnd that 's just say he says for an example if you say that there 's one abortion just only one abortion that takes place a day that 's thirty abortions a month\n\n\nAnd if it has the consent of both parents that 's sixty uh that 's sixty murderers that you have a month\n\n\nBut talk about it I mean this is what he was saying alright uh you have six hundred murderers in ten months\n\n\nI mean these are people who will carry the burden and the scar of that in their souls\n\n\nAnd you have women in the United States who will fight for the right to the life of a dolphin who will go after women who are wearing fur coats because it 's inhumane okay\n\n\nThey arrested a guy and put him in jail because he poisoned the tree in Austin Texas under which the Constitution was signed\n\n\nBut they go ahead and they kill, their babies and nobody puts a stop to it\n\n\nThe elections ninth next year of nineteen ninety-two is a very pivotal election, even for the world\n\n\nBecause next year the election in the United States is going to hinge on one very important issue, abortion\n\n\nRight now everybody has been making their moves\n\n\nThe the elections that took place last year for the governor and the state Senators  etcetera  and so on was hinged on that\n\n\nSo much so that even men who didn't believe in abortion kept silent because they didn't want to jeopardize their political careers\n\n\nAnd that 's what happens because we have uh careers to think of because uh we have other priorities we have kept silent and so the murder of the innocents goes on\n\n\nAnd in the end we will have to answer for that\n\n\nThat 's why our Lady is coming and that 's why our Lady is crying and that 's why our Lady is calling because I think you have to understand that we must participate in our own salvation\n\n\nAnd we must participate also in the salvation of others\n\n\nThat 's her strongest message\n\n\nShe is saying that we have at this time lost all sense of sin\n\n\nWe 've learned to justify everything\n\n\nHusbands and wives split up because they are unfaithful to one another\n\n\nOr they don't they can't get along with one another and the lives of their children are destroyed\n\n\nTheir children grow up broken-hearted embittered and so on\n\n\nMany of them go on to have broken families themselves\n\n\nIn fact there was a study that was revealed that was released in a Newsweek magazine about two years ago where psychiatrists and psychologists who had done several tests on broken homes uh discovered that they were wrong\n\n\nBecause normally psychiatrists and psychologists will say uh if the husband and wife or the parents start to fight and they fight uh intensively then it is best that they separate because the children suffer the trauma of hearing their families fight\n\n\nWell they discovered twenty thirty years later after they had propagated this message that almost ninety percent of the children who came from families that had separated have all got married grew up got married and had separated themselves could not keep their families together\n\n\nWhereas the children whose families have stayed together despite the fact that they were fighting managed to grow up and have families that stay together\n\n\nAnd so they released this article and saying they were wrong\n\n\nBut in the meantime you have an entire generation of wrecked home lives because they were being taught what was wrong\n\n\nWhat happens to the idea of sacrifice\n\n\nOur Lady says we must learn to sacrifice for others that 's why she 's coming\n\n\nShe 's appearing in almost every country of the world\n\n\nI just got a call this morning five thousand people in Georgia in a place called Conyers or something like that in Georgia went out uh\n\n\nShe 's been appearing there to a white woman a very simple white woman in Georgia and she 's been giving messages on the thirteenth of every month and Jesus would appear too and five thousand people were there and they saw in the sky what looked like cloud formation but very very clear\n\n\nThis woman who called me told me she saw it herself\n\n\nShe says I saw it so clearly it was like you were watching on T V\n\n\nIt was etched so clearly the face of Jesus Our Lady and the Father\n\n\nThe signs are everywhere\n\n\nGo back to the Bible and read what it says there\n\n\nThe signs are everywhere\n\n\nIt 's happening in the sun\n\n\nIt 's happening on the earth the earth is trembling everything is happening and Our Lady is crying\n\n\nI don't wanna sound like a prophet of doom but you should know you should know that right now everything is making  tugma  \n\n\nOur Lady is appearing in many places of the world and the and the  and the and the messages that she 's giving there in some remote mountain or some hill or some poor village or what will tally exactly with what she 's saying somewhere else\n\n\nAnd everything is coming together\n\n\nAnd so she 's calling on the youth and she 's telling parents a lot of her messages now her latest messages\n\n\nI didn't have time for my Lipa I don't know how many of you saw my Lipa show but uh I mentioned in the Lipa show that the petals were falling again and that the messages that she 's receiving messages again\n\n\nWell the messages are directed at parents very strong that parents have to realize they have a responsibility to bring their children to God\n\n\nThat parents have to realize that they must give the good example for their children because many times it is the  the fault of the parents who cannot bring their children who don't teach  the children that God is an intrinsic part of their lives\n\n\nOur Lady says she teaches us in Medjugorje she says begin and everything begin and end everything with God\n\n\nShe said you know the problem with you is that you you work too much and you pray too little \n\n She says you know if you reverse the process if you reverse the process she said you 'd see how easy it would go \n\n\nAnd she was talking to people who are farmers\n\n\nIn Medjugorje very poor very hard rocky country they grow tobacco\n\n\nAnd you have to work hard for tobacco", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nOkay uh good morning my fellow administrators\n\n\nUhm a student uh came to me one day to interview me for a school paper\n\n\nAnd the first question he asked me was uh, how do you find your work as an administrator\n\n\nBy way of an answer I said uh would you tell me what you call the season from June to December here in our country \n\n\nAnd at first his answer was rainy season Ma'am\n\n\nAnd I said not quite because sometimes in a normal situation you don't find any rain in December\n\n\nAnd because he sensed that I was driving at something he said uh it 's the typhoon season Ma'am\n\n\nAnd I said precisely that is the season that we go through as administrators\n\n\nTyphoons come sometimes if you 're unlucky you uh you get from Akang to Bening to Herming to Yoling  \n\n\nAnd we have to you know handle them well\n\n\nAnd uh today I am going to give you as share with you some of the cases that we 've have come our way in Dasmari&ntilde;as\n\n\nAnd uh give you a short background and maybe uh tell you how we handle the case, \n\n\n faculty member she was on her second year of probation who sued the school for illegal dismissal and unfair labor practice\n\n\nYou know this is uh a baptism of fire for me because the decision of the National Labor Relations Commission uh which was final and executory came during my first month in office\n\n\nSo I was telling myself my goodness this is the tail end of typhoon Akang, \n\n\nBut there are some lessons that could be learned and these I 'd like to share with you because in this case the faculty member who was on probation was rehired after one year despite the unfavorable evaluation of the Chair\n\n\nThat is she was given a second chance\n\n\nAlthough the Chair 's evaluation  uh pointed to her teaching approach as not fit to college level teaching\n\n\nUh we were saying that maybe that should not have been done because one year would be enough for us to assess two uh two semesters to assess the competence of a faculty member\n\n\nSecond the faculty member felt that her poor evaluation was a personal bias on the part of the Chair and the coordinator\n\n\nBecause records show when I saw this in the file that to substantiate their stand against the faculty member they did an interview of her students and she learned about this\n\n\nUh people who were present at that time intimated to me that if only those involved had sat down to talk and had really engaged in a sincere dialogue and discussion this could not have been a court case\n\n\nThe University lost the case uh we paid back wages and attorney 's fees in the amount of three hundred thousand pesos\n\n\nWe tried to appeal the case to the Supreme Court but then the lawyer did not take good care of our case and therefore we really lost the case and paid the attorney 's fees and the back wages\n\n\nThis is for three years back wages for three years\n\n\nLuckily the the salary at Dasmari&ntilde;as is low so even for three years it amounted only to that much\n\n\nUh the second case I 'd like to uh share with you is a case of breach of contract, uh by a faculty member\n\n\nAll these cases are involving faculty members\n\n\nThe University was constrained to seek the assistance of a  legal counsel to handle the case of one faculty member who abandoned his classes at the middle of the semester in favor of a job abroad\n\n\nConsidered a beach a breach of contract the abandonment really caused tremendous difficulty on the part of the school who assigned classes to other faculty members\n\n\nBut a close look at the case revealed that his immediate supervisor failed to explain to him the consequences of his act and even facilitated his exit by endorsing his letter of resignation to the V P Academics\n\n\nSo we asked the help of a legal counsel which is ACCRA and ACCRA sent him a letter informing him that he indeed uh committed a breach of contract and demanding a payment of twenty thousand pesos for moral damages\n\n\nTwenty thousand is not much money but we wanted to give the teachers in school a lesson not to abandon their classes in mid-stream\n\n\nWell he has complied with this requirement but the harm has been done to the classes that was assigned to him and that is for one, half of the semester\n\n\nThe third case I 'd like to share with you is a case of misappropriation of funds, \n\n\nUsing a college trust fund we have trust funds in our University\n\n\nA check was issued by the University to one department chair for implementing a school activity\n\n\nI think this was a case of a debate this was a debate to be attended by a group of students in one university\n\n\nNow at that time one faculty member who was also on probation was in-charge of the activity and the money was entrusted to him by the Chair\n\n\nThe activity did not push through for some reasons but the faculty failed to return the money\n\n\nMeantime the status board had to meet because the faculty member was on probation and it was the term was about to end and the the decision was to let his contract expire\n\n\nWhen he learned about this he stopped coming to school\n\n\nBut of course he had given the examination that was the end of the semester, \n\n\nWhen the course card distribution came he could nowhere be found\n\n\nAnd so the Chair uh did his best to look for him\n\n\nHe succeeded in retrieving the grades\n\n\nBut the money is still uh not returned to the school\n\n\nWell in our opinion the person accountable for the money should have   should have disbursed the fund himself\n\n\nAnd entrusting the same to one who is on probation and had a record of indiscriminate borrowing from fellow teachers should not have should have been avoided, \n\n\nAnother case is the case of uh cheating during examinations\n\n\nWould you believe that we we had a teacher who tolerated cheating while proctoring a class and a uh a group of students complained about it\n\n\nAnd now because the complaint was written we had to to uh institute due process\n\n\nAnd so therefore we had the grievance board and there and so forth and so on\n\n\nAnd the findings by the grievance board showed that the teacher was indeed guilty of the charge and he admitted it in writing\n\n\nWell the V P Academics consulted me and asked me what are we going to do with the case\n\n\nI said well uh we can terminate him  'no  but uh out of compassion we simply asked him you resign now because the students might you know pursue the case\n\n\nSo he resigned at the middle of the term, \n\n\nUh this is one case where the vigilance on the part of the faculty could have prevented a formal complaint by the students because we were informed by some faculty members that in the past similar cases had already happened uh involving the same teacher but these were not reported to us and therefore nothing was done so far\n\n\nSo only when the complaint was filed that we had to act on it\n\n\nAnd the last but the not the least uh case I 'd like to share with you I entitled it Status Board Decision versus Promised Ranks by the Chair and the coordinator, \n\n\nUh as in other units ranks are decided by a Board not by individual persons  'no  \n\n\nBut in this uh instance uh many times the decision proved to be different from those promised by a Chair when he hires or recruits the faculty member\n\n\nAnd a crisis occurs when the concerned faculty who was promised a higher rank than the one decided by the Board will not respect the Board 's decision\n\n\nAnd in our case the faculty member even stopped teaching after two weeks because he did not get the rank that he wanted\n\n\nBut we have a Faculty Manual which has to be followed and uh it has to be respected, \n\n\nSo the situation could have been avoided we said if an initial but thorough assessment evaluation of the credentials of the faculty member had been done even before promising anything\n\n\nAnd maybe he 's telling the faculty member that that is just an estimate don't don't take it as as already awarded to you the the appointment the rank\n\n\nBecause it is the Board that makes the final decision\n\n\nWell ideally and I think we all should observe this no one starts handling a class prior to his official appointment so that we will not get into trouble\n\n\nAnd that presupposes then that those of us in the departments should be ready with the papers and all the hiring requirements so that the Status Board can meet the Hiring Board can meet before the start of any term\n\n\nThat 's all that I can share with you today", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5e782b04-a1e0-4ffd-a2be-52a4cfabd4bf", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nNow I know that I succeeded in teaching  \n\n\nThat was a very very good lecture\n\n\nThank you very much Tish\n\n\nUh, you do not know how happy I am because uh you are not the\nprofessorial uh honoree  \n\n\nBut with all you around here uh why you honor I don't know how much\n\n how honored I am with your presence here\n\n\nUh I do not have a unlike Brother Andrew who wrote his paper I note\nthat it is just \" Remarks \" \n\n\nDr Castillo made a mistake when she said \" A Few Remarks\n\n\" it just says \" Remarks \" here uh in other words I\ncan make as many as I want  \n\n\nUh  thirty years ago in nineteen sixty-two when I left\nthe Department of Education after uhm twenty-nine years in the Bureau of\nPublic Schools earlier Bureau of Education uh when I was leaving I can still\nremember my friends at the General Office telling me there must be sand in\nyour head or rocks in your head there must be there 's something wrong\n\n\nHere you are about to become a big shot a superintendent and I must\nsay that the ambition of every classroom teacher when he starts is to be some\nday a division superintendent so that he will have many men under him, \n\n\nBut uh I had just gotten my P H D the previous year I got my P H D\nvery late uh and uh I became dissatisfied with what I was doing in the Bureau\nof Public Schools as a General Office Supervisor\n\n\nThere was no time to think no time at all to think\n\n\nWe would I would travel all over the provinces in for two weeks I\nsaw almost all the provinces in the Philippines then come home\n\n\nAnd what do I do\n\n\nWrite a report then afterwards while you are writing your report\nyour boss tells you , I can still see my boss now\nMr Jose Cortes and Mr Tupas  just before five o'clock time to go\nhome Boni will you please stay because we have to write a speech for the\nSecretary\n\n\nWell I was just a General Office Supervisor so I stayed and we\nwould write this speech because it was going to be read the following morning\n\n\nI thought that uh this was not the life I wanted so uh when I had\nthe request from the University of the Philippines and the Philippine Normal\nCollege at the same time almost at the same time\n\n\nOne day the late Dr Aldana called for me and said uh Sibayan there\nare two requests here for you to either go to P N C or to U P and he  and he said if I were you I 'd go to the P N C because you are not a U P\ngraduate  Aldana  ha  Aldana  Director of Public Schools\n\n\nThose of you who know academe in this country know what that means\n\n it 's a commentary on our  on our culture\n\n\nSo I left and uh I remember Doming Landicho I 'm giving you his\nname so that you know him from Batangas he said why do you leave now\n\n\nSoon you 'll be, there in the Philippine Normal College you 'll\njust be a classroom teacher\n\n\nYou 'll have only maybe thirty forty students at most\n\n\nYou must be crazy\n\n\nI left\n\n\nI have never regretted my leaving  the\nDepartment of Education for academe because imagine the people I would have\nmissed\n\n\nI would have missed you  I would have missed my\nstudents and there are quite a number here\n\n\nAnd even if they were not my students I would have missed people\nwith whom I would not have had the privilege of coming in contact trying to\npit one 's uh ability to think through a certain problem with another one who\nthinks he has a better solution\n\n\nI think that 's there 's nothing more exciting than that\n\n\nAnd then of course terrifying your students to quote  Tish last year she said terrifying your students to excellence\n\n\nUh let me look at my notes because\n\n\nYou know at my age sometimes well it seems I 've accomplished\neverything\n\n\nThe only thing I don't have is money  uh but that 's\nall right\n\n\nSome day I 'll win the sweepstakes maybe\n\n\nUh somebody asked me Well now you have accomplished practically\neverything\n\n\nWhat do you want\n\n\nWhat 's your next ambition\n\n\nAnd I said my next ambition is to reach my next birthday  because we 'll listen again to a lecture like this you know  \n\n\nThere 's something to look forward to\n\n\nSo I 'll live one  one day and one year at a time right\n\n\nSo that 's my that 's of course I have many major and minor\nambitions\n\n\nThat 's a major ambition now yes\n\n\nA minor ambition is to make money\n\n\nIt 's too late  according to Nanette uh here it 's\ntoo late that 's right it 's too late\n\n\nUhm about two weeks ago I got a proposal for a doctoral for a\ndoctoral dissertation\n\n\nAfter reading it  I called up Dr Otanes where 's\nFe is she here oh I 'm disappointed\n\n\nShe 's Dean of the Graduate School and I said let 's postpone this\nuh this colloquium because we 'll have a colloquium because I 'm going to\nconvince Brother Andrew and Tish Bautista to be members of the panel of uh of\nthose who will question this girl\n\n\nSo I asked them what time they would be available and they said\nthey they would be available tomorrow afternoon at two\n\n\nSo we will be at the Philippine Normal College tomorrow afternoon\nBrother Andrew and Tish and I to grill this girl uh she 's here  she 's there  on her proposal\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause here 's a proposal here 's a girl willing to do something\nthat nobody has ever attempted to do before\n\n\nAnd it is something that we should have scholars in in this uh\nfield uh  besides of course uh I didn't know too much\nabout the subject\n\n\nIt 's Tish Bautista who 's number one in the Philippines today in\nthat field and uh Brother Andrew is now a very close number two  because he 's so busy in the \" Bulletin\n\n\"  and and\n\n\nAnyway so but when we find a student I think the most the thing\nthat is good about teaching especially in graduate school is that when you\n\n find a very good student that 's a gem you begin to become\nexcited you know you want to to mentor this student you you want to to to, \nI I cannot describe to you what what joy you can get uh by by working with\nwith a good student\n\n\nThere 's there 's  nothing you can compare it with\n\n\nUh Brother Andrew has a uh has an expression which I will not say\nhere because it is not said in polite company  but that that 's what I mean you see without telling you what he said\n\n \n\n\nI 'm glad that I 'm very happy that Tish talked about the classroom\nbecause I 've said many times I said it in fact about last month I think\nJanuary four when I spoke at the Philippine Normal College\n\n\nWithout the classroom teacher without the classroom education will\nnot will not take place\n\n\nUh the teacher when the classroom teachers of the City of Manila\nwent on strike not all the superintendents and the supervisors and the\ncoordinators I don't know what kind of job is that coordinator not all these\nuh non-teachers could do anything to educate the children\n\n\nSo the classroom is still, you you have to go back to the\nclassroom really to to get education going\n\n\nAn uh oh the future I wish I were young again\n\n\nI wish I were I said last year I wish I were sixty but this year\nthis time I think I wish I were fifty\n\n\nMaybe next year if I will reach the one more year I 'll wish I were\nforty and conquer the world  \n\n\nSo one thing that we are trying to do now actually in fact it seems\nmy interpretation of Tish 's lecture is that finally we are trying to find\nthe problems in search of a solution\n\n\nYou see we have many solutions uhm in fact teaching is when you\nface the class the first time you begin applying what you know you know the\nsolution you never find out the problem\n\n\nYes uh that 's why so many pupils fail because we don't know the\nproblem\n\n\nWe have so many\n\n\nLook at for example the first comment the first recommendation of\nthe Angara Commission\n\n\nThe decision is correct but the timetable is wrong\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause they know the solution but they don't know the problem when\nthey said that we are going to uh you know replace English in ten to fifteen\nyears from first year to fourth year uh high school uh with Filipino\n\n\nIt just shows they know the solution but they don't know the\nproblem\n\n\nThey are like my  when I had my my windshield\nwiper was not working so I brought it to the repair shop\n\n\nAnd I found a guy there trying to fix a car like that the lights\nwould not go go out\n\n\nHe tried everything he tried everything and then finally he gave up\n\n\nHe knew the solutions but he didn't know the problem\n\n\nSo I 'm very happy that uh we 're going to find problems and\neventually find solutions  \n\n\nYou know if you will allow me to talk I can talk until tomorrow\nmorning but I 'll not do that  \n\n\nUh, so uh, by the way I was invited to talk on May eighteen\non uh on the role of grammar on uh in uh the development of Filipino but I 'm\ntelling Gani Cruz Isagani Cruz here who is going to run this that I 'm not\ngoing to talk about that uhm the role of grammar as if I know the solution\n\n\nNo what I 'm going to talk about is uh \"  Mga\nMahalagang Suliranin tungkol sa Pag-uunlad ng Filipino  \" \n, okay good  \n\n\nSo my friends thank you very much for coming here taking your\nprecious time and I know that at this hour to go home is uhm not only a\nproblem it 's a compounded one and uh I 'm really honored with your presence\nand I hope that I will realize my ambition of reaching my next birthday and\nthat you will come again\n\n\nWell and I hope one more of my students will read the next lecture\n\n\nThank you very much   \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm may I also thank all my friends\nhere uh the moment you appear here you are my friend yes  like Colonel Ravina there whom I met and the lady I uh who\nsits beside him who is your sister-in-law uh your sister your sister okay\n\n\nYour lecture Dr Ravina  reminded me of many things\n\n\nI was reminded of that the most famous one of the most famous uh\nletters written in the teaching profession during the early days of this uh\ncentury\n\n\nUh any old teacher like me knows this uh story this\n\n\nUh there was this lady who turned in her resignation and uh uh said\nuh you know at that time every, if you write to the Division\nSuperintendent of Schools it 's always \" the Division Superintendent\nof Schools Baguio \" and it 's always \" Sir \" \n\n\nIf you are below if you are inferior in position you say \" \nSir \" but if you are superior and you write to a teacher it is\n\n\" Dear Sir \" or \" Dear Madam \" \n\n\n And this teacher  tendered her resignation and said\nuh  Sir I have the honor to resignate because the salaries are too few\nand the works are too many and besides that the supervising teacher are\nalways is always making too many lovings to me    \n\n\nNow this is one of the most famous uh resignations in the annals of\nPhilippine  education\n\n\nUhm I do not know whether her resignation was accepted or not  but it must have been  \n\n\nUhm errors errors errors\n\n\nUhm, Dr Otanes who 's here who was my colleague at the\nPhilippine Normal College once told me that English has not deteriorated\nbecause we always say \" the deterioration of English in the\nPhilippines \" \n\n\nNo English has not  deteriorated and it is still\nthere very good\n\n\nThe  the ones that have deteriorated are the teachers\nand the pupils\n\n\nMaybe that 's true\n\n\nSo uh now uh , there is I think a\ndifference between correctness of English and acceptability\n\n\nYou mentioned about acceptability\n\n\nMy favorite story or anecdote about this is about this man who\nworked in a shipyard and he noticed that during lunchtime nobody would like\nto have lunch with him\n\n\nAll the other workers would group themselves and he would be left\nalone\n\n\nAnd uh uh one day he had the courage to ask one of his friends why\nis it that nobody wanted to have lunch with him and uh he was always left\nalone\n\n\nAnd so the man said Brother do you want to know the truth or shall\nI tell a lie\n\n\nAnd he said uh tell me the truth\n\n\nLook he said do you not notice in this dockyard he said you are\nthe only one who is always saying \" those ships \" while\neveryone here says \" them ships \"  \n\n\nSo it may be wrong but it 's the acceptable thing\n\n\nSo sometimes we are uh we don't know those of us who have taught\nEnglish is it correct but not acceptable or wrong but acceptable\n\n\nThat 's a that poses a dilemma", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nMs Subido, participants in this uh afternoon 's affair at the Management of Financial Institutions good afternoon\n\n\nWhen uh Mr Anderson went to my office to invite me to be your guest speaker this afternoon I immediately accepted the invitation notwithstanding the very tight official schedule that I have, because we always look at this opportunity to clarify whatever misconceptions people have about the Bureau of Customs, \n\n\nYour written invitation requested me to say or to speak on the subject of the role of the Bureau of Customs towards nation building\n\n\nI don't know really if this is the real intent because if this is the one it will be much easier for me\n\n\nBut maybe many of you here who are in one way or another has something to do with the Bureau of Customs either you personally or your parents or your friends who 'd like to know about the Bureau of Customs, \n\n\nI think all of you are students of Economics and uh our economics textbooks tell us that the primary purpose of the Bureau of Customs is to facilitate trade, \n\n\nSo that the revenue-generating function of the Bureau of Customs is only secondary\n\n\nHowever in a developing country like the Philippines wherein the sources of revenues of the government is not enough, to meet all the financial obligations of the government, the Bureau of Customs is considered as a major revenue-generating agency, \n\n\nThe Bureau of Customs is second only to the Bureau of Internal Revenue in revenue generation\n\n\nFor this year the original target given to the Bureau of Customs to collect is eighty-five point one billion pesos\n\n\nThat is thirty-five percent of the expected revenue of the government, \n\n\nIf you will compare this with developed countries, percentage wise what is being expected from the Bureau of Customs is too much\n\n\nIf you take for instance Japan or the United States their customs services only collects about three percent of the national revenue of those countries\n\n\nYou can see therefore that the Bureau of Customs is heavily burdened by our government to collect revenues, \n\n\nThe expected revenue for this year was eighty-one eighty-five point one billion\n\n\nBut the computations of this expected revenue were based on several assumptions\n\n\nFirst the assumption is the volume and value of imports which was estimated to be thirteen billion dollars, \n\n\nIt 's also assumed that sixty-five percent of non-oil imports will be subject to tax and duties and thirty-five percent are exempted from the payment of duties and taxes, \n\n\nIt was also assumed that the oil-import, ninety-five percent will be tax-exempt will be subject to tax and five percent will be exempt from tax\n\n\nAnother assumption was, the nine percent levy I think all of you have already heard of this nine percent levy will be applied for the entire year of nineteen ninety-one\n\n\nAnd that the dollar exchange will be twenty-eight pesos and fifty centavos to a dollar\n\n\nThese were the major assumptions in the computation of our target\n\n\nHowever there are economic developments not only in the Philippines but in other parts of the world that affected our economy\n\n\nFor instance the Gulf War\n\n\nAnother is the national calamities that happened in our country, \n\n\nSo that sometime in July the target for the Bureau of Customs was recomputed and it was lowered to seventy-eight point five billion\n\n\nHowever as of last month September, our planning institutions particularly the NEDA have come up that the most reasonable target for the Bureau of Customs this year is sixty-four point eight billion\n\n\nIf this latest assessment will be followed we in the Bureau of Customs, are very confident that we are going to meet our target\n\n\nAs of now we just have to collect sixteen billion up to the end of the year to meet the target\n\n\nAnd the rate of import is very encouraging\n\n\nAdministration of the Bureau of Customs is not simply collection of duties and taxes\n\n\nIf you are really interested on the role of the Bureau of Customs on nation-building, in addition to the revenues that the Bureau of Customs collect for the government we have to consider the many services that we provide to importers and exporters\n\n\nYou can see that there is a continuous growth of importation in this country even if we remove the effect of inflation\n\n\nIn other words if we consider the real value there is a definite increase in the amount of imports in this country\n\n\nThe same thing can be said about our exports\n\n\nThe same thing can be said about investments of foreign businessmen into the country\n\n\nWe can say that in the growth of import growth of imports export and growth of investment the Bureau of Customs contribute in the proper administration of all their activities\n\n\nLet me start from the pricing of imports\n\n\nWhen I first joined the Bureau of Customs in nineteen eighty-seven our processing procedures required forty-two signatures before an importation can be released from the Bureau of Customs\n\n\nAnd sometimes it will take up to a month or more before an import can be released\n\n\nSo the very first thing I did was to examine our import procedures\n\n\nAnd with the help of my staff we were able to reduce the number of signatures from forty-two to seven\n\n\nAnd the number of stations from fifteen to seven to, four, \n\n\nSo we really expedited the processing of import documents\n\n\nI ordered that unless there is something wrong in the importation, they should be released within seventy-two hours upon unloading in our country\n\n\nThis system that I have initiated we call it the non-stop processing in the release of shipments\n\n\nAs we progressed we further improved our uh processing procedure\n\n\nWe came up with what we call express processing in the release of shipment wherein theoretically, import documents can be processed even before the arrival of the goods\n\n\nSo that when the goods arrive in the pier they can be transferred from the ship to your truck, to your warehouse\n\n\nSo it is possible that a shipment can be released from the Bureau of Customs within hours upon arrival into the country\n\n\nThis is our biggest contribution to the importing industry by facilitating the release of their shipment\n\n\nWe have several procedure in the handling of exports\n\n\nWe have also   systematized the procedure so that exportation would be very easy for our exporters\n\n\nThe second line of services that we provide is in the storage of raw materials\n\n\nIn other words the Bureau of Customs supervises the warehouses that our importers and exporters operates\n\n\nIn the Metro Manila area alone we have more than eight hundred warehouses warehouses of all kinds manufacturing miscellaneous public and private and garment\n\n\nIt is the Bureau of Customs that supervises the operation of these warehouses\n\n\nBefore I came to the Bureau of Customs for every warehouse there is assigned a warehouseman a storekeeper that will account for the raw materials that they 're importing and they are exporting\n\n\nIn view of the numerous complaints of warehouse operators of abuses committed by customs personnel and with the advent advent of computers we have adopted the what we call \" open banded system \" wherein the monitoring of imported materials is done through computers by account officers in our central office\n\n\nThis procedure dispensed the services of a warehouseman and a storekeeper\n\n\nYou can see that in almost everything that we do in the Bureau of Customs is to support our importers and exporters who after all are the prime movers of our economy\n\n\nWe cannot point out a single project that supports economic development but we can say that in almost all economic activities in this country the Bureau of Customs has some participation\n\n\nSo as you can see, the Bureau of Customs is one of the most essential element or agency of the government\n\n\nBut sad to say because of the very unfavorable image of the Bureau of Customs in the past and the very unsympathetic attitude of many of our politicians the Bureau of Customs is encountering so much difficulty in performing its mandated function\n\n\nFor instance the Bureau of Customs last year collected forty-eight billion pesos but our appropriation was a measly amount of three hundred eighty-eight million\n\n\nThere is not a single centavo appropriated for equipment\n\n\nMaybe some of you have gone to the Bureau of Customs and you saw for yourself the very pitiful and miserable working condition of the Bureau of Customs\n\n\nFor example in the Manila International Container Port a port that collects about hundred ten million pesos a day is housed in a former warehouse\n\n\nI mention this because, while so much is expected from the Bureau of Customs very little is given\n\n\nI think uh Mr. Anderson can tell you the appearance of the office\n\n\nIt could not maybe even equal the office of a section chief of the G S I S or the Philippine National Bank\n\n\nBut that is the attitude of our people\n\n\nThey feel that because the Bureau of Customs is collecting so much money everybody in that agency has plenty of money and the agency as a whole is supported with the proper amount of money in its appropriation\n\n\nThe Bureau of Customs is facing so much problems\n\n\nI have already mentioned to you the financial support, \n\n\nThe second is public apathy and the corrupting influence of our society\n\n\nI say \" public apathy \" because, many of our people know a lot of illegal activities of our importers and exporters\n\n\nBut they would rather remain silent because they don't want to be involved\n\n\nOr if they do they make anonymous letters to the newspapers or radio announcers accusing personnels of the Bureau of Customs or the agency as a whole for graft and corruption\n\n\nAnd yet they would not like to come forward to be identified, \n\n\nOur newspapers are only very good in printing articles or stories derogatory or against the Bureau of Customs\n\n\nThey have never taken pains to study and understand the many reforms that we have instituted in the Bureau of Customs to make it an agency useful to the economy and more responsive to the needs of the people dealing in the Bureau of Customs\n\n\nThat 's why sometimes when I open containers involving irregular shipment I would rather not invite the press or the radio and television people because many people have already developed the impression that the main purpose of the Bureau of Customs is to catch smugglers\n\n\nIf ever we are doing that it is only incidental\n\n\nWe catch smugglers to protect our local manufacturers who are being prejudiced by the items that they are smuggling and to protect the interests of the government so that we can collect the proper amount of duties and taxes\n\n\nThere are many other areas of the Bureau of Customs which I can discuss with you but as I told Mr Anderson I think it would do us better if I 'll just give an overview and you ask questions\n\n\nBecause by so doing I 'm sure that I will be addressing the issue that you are interested to know, \n\n Like for example I don't know how many of you here would like to learn more about our anti-smuggling campaign\n\n\nHow many of you here would like to know what are the measures that I 've taken to fight graft and corruption in the Bureau of Customs\n\n\nHow many of you here uh are interested to know what are the things I have done to help importers and exporters\n\n\nAnd what are the measures I have done to improve collection efficiency in the Bureau of Customs\n\n\nAnd I said the topic which you wanted me to talk about is the role of the Bureau of Customs in nation-building\n\n\nAnd I can simply state that our contribution in nation-building is by facilitating trade so that our importers and exporters can conduct their activities in such a way that will promote growth and stability\n\n\nSo I leave you at that\n\n\nI am prepared to answer any question about the Bureau of Customs",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nOkay can you hear me\n\n\nUhm I think that it 's very difficult for people to to just listen\n\n\nUh I think we 've spent too much of our time in classrooms where all the teachers gave us was the talk talk talk talk so I think I 'll just stay here\n\n\nThis morning uh before we even begin to think about the possibilities for early childhood development in the media I would like to put a put it in a proper context  'no  in terms of the relationship of children and media\n\n\nBecause as an educator I still think that nothing takes the place of hands-on parenting and hands-on teaching especially for young children\n\n\nSo let me qualify with that premise right away\n\n\nAt its best any form of media television radio CD-ROMs  'no  books can only be a supplementary learning tool\n\n\nAnd uh in that way we have to put it in its proper place\n\n\nIt can't work miracles\n\n\nIt can only be like a good book a good an additional resource for a parent\n\n\nBut the children today are growing up in an environment where media plays different roles for them\n\n\nIt 's been called the surrogate parent\n\n\nIt 's also <unclear> word </unclear> for the youth considered a touchstone by which they define their standards\n\n\nAnd recent studies among Metro Manila youth and even the the nineteen ninety-six survey of the S W S among Filipino youth bares this out  'no  \n\n\nThey spend more time watching television listening to the radio than they do interacting with their own parents\n\n\nAnd these are the youth from the ages of fifteen to twenty-four\n\n\nUhm we could also consider some some Filipino youth who are in urban centers as trekkers of the information superhighway\n\n\nAnd we like to think that Filipino children belong to a global village  'no  but how how actively they are participating in that I I would question later on\n\n\nHow do parents use the media, maybe this also tells us how children especially now in urban centers spend more time than they should watching television, and what 's on television, \n\n\nFilipino children spend an average of three to four hours a day watching T V, \n\n\nThis is a cartoon but it 's actually correct data because yes by the age of six that 's about the number of times a child would see murders\n\n\nOur organization has just completed a study monitoring content of children 's television for the last year\n\n\nAnd both advertising and day time television contains not only a lot of violence but also a lot of sex sex sexist uh gratuitous or something that is beyond what is uh appropriate for children to deal with okay, \n\n\nWhat 's the media landscape like for Filipino children\n\n\nWe we say that they are uh media users we say that they 're media consumers, okay\n\n\nIf this if we were to take a look at it this is how it 's like \n\n \n\n\nI was in Ifugao just recently and uhm in the  sari-sari  store in the  poblacion  I had behind me several grade schoolers borrowing  aksiyon pahiram nga ng aksiyon  \n\n\nSo  pagtingin ko ano 'yung aksiyon 'yung mga  Ramon Revilla Bong Revilla movies  'no  all the violent kinds of Filipino movies\n\n\nSo they 're no longer sheltered from those kinds of action movies they call them\n\n\nIn urban centers you have everything  'no  there 's access\n\n\nOf course this this would depend on the socio-economic group okay\n\n\nIn terms of access to channels we now live in a world of multi-channels we have many options  'no  \n\n\nCable is increasingly more popular among the middle class and upper class students or children\n\n\nUhm teenagers take in thirty hours of broadcast media and spend much less time reading okay, \n\n\nThere are four four hundred ten T V programs now on air\n\n\nEighty-nine only are considered children 's programs\n\n\nIt 's a very skewed uh balance  dito  uh for this ratio because children spend more time watching than adults\n\n\nBut even when we were working on the Children 's Television Act with Secretary Escudero the K B P was strongly against the provision to to compel uh all broadcasters to allocate fifteen percent of air time\n\n\nBy the time we got to the Senate so  nakalusot 'yan sa  House  kasi pinilit ng mga  Congressmen by the time we got to the Senate on the last before the bicameral conference they were still at it\n\n\nFinally I said you say you value Filipino children\n\n\nWhen you say form these organizations these networks because you uh value the quality of T V that should be given to Filipino children but it 's lip service because you refuse to give even that fifteen percent\n\n\nSo  sabi ko puede ba ibalato na lang natin 'yan sa batang Pilipino  \n\n\nBut until now that 's still a thorny point  'no  \n\n\nSo uh it 's still a question of how much time and what there is for children, okay\n\n\nFilipino kids watch twenty to twenty-eight hours a week which means a thousand up to one thousand thirty-four hours per year so by the age of thirty they would have spent four to five years of their lives watching television\n\n\nWhat a waste if what they see on television is like the cartoon I showed you wasteful okay\n\n\nSo what about content  'no  \n\n\nWhat does television have to offer our children\n\n\nIn our monitoring study that we did on what what children have now aside from the fact that seventy percent are imported meaning mostly American second Japanese cartoons uhm dubbed also in Filipino okay the others are  they 're mostly really the kinds of cartoons that are  'yung  wacky type  'yung  Looney Tunes type\n\n\nThey 're the ones which the U C L A study a national television study did in the U S in in by it it 's the biggest national study of its kind they are the cartoons which are considered violent\n\n\n 'Yung mga maya't-maya merong napipisa o kaya nadadaanan ng pison o sumasabog 'yun  \n\n\nUhm it 's not a problem if you 're dealing with children seven and above but if you 're dealing with children five and below and they have an overdose of those kinds of cartoons then you are in effect desensitizing them to that kind of physical aggression\n\n\nThat 's the for me the biggest problem in violence in television is not the fact that there is violence because if violence has a context our own historical struggle as a people is very violent  'no  \n\n\nIn  Batibot  we had to uhm to show Filipino ethics and there 's no avoiding the violent the conflict because that is the story of our that 's our collective history as a people\n\n\nBut there is a context\n\n\nBloodshed had a context\n\n\nAnd there 's also a way of deemphasizing it rather than making it the major part of the story\n\n\nSo the biggest danger really of children 's continued exposure to violence is that they become desensitized to it\n\n\nThat it becomes a normal fact of life\n\n\nThat it becomes the one best solution\n\n\nAnd so how do we deal with it if the content is uhm overtly violent or overtly sexual and children can take can only look at it out of context\n\n\nWe have to take a pro-active stance and that 's what we 're trying to do in the last many years  'no  \n\n\nUhm  Batibot  was born after \" Sesame \" the Philippine co-production of the Children 's Television Workshop had to go to sleep or we had to put it to bed because the nineteen eighty-three political and economic crisis did not make it tenable to keep uh paying the Children 's Television Workshop all those dollars  'no  \n\n\nSo we looked at one another and said  sayang 'yung natutunan natin  \n\n\nSo let 's go for it\n\n\nPremature but let 's give birth to a premature baby and nurture it\n\n\nSo far  Batibot  is on its fifteenth year\n\n\nAnd so we 've literally helped to rear to nurture a generation\n\n\nAnd uhm now I still meet college students as I 'm invited to speak to different groups and they tell me I grew up with  Batibot  \n\n\nAnd I ask them what was it that made it uhm you know meaningful to you or relevant to you\n\n\nMany of them were saying that it taught me that I could be proud to be a Filipino \n\n\nAnd I think if only for that we 've accomplished what we set out to accomplish\n\n\n Hindi ako nahiya magsalita ng Tagalog o ng Filipino  okay\n\n\nI know that now and FUSE specialists are very concerned about uhm the problem with English learning\n\n\nAs an educator and especially in terms of early childhood development one of the most important developmental milestones is language learning\n\n\nAnd it is an asset for cognitive development if an individual has a dominant language even if you are going to be  multilingual\n\n\nI I can take myself as an example\n\n\nI think I 'm quite fluent in English\n\n\nI speak two other languages in addition\n\n\nBut my language is Filipino\n\n\nMy parents brought us up to speak Filipino in the household  kasi nagkataon pareho silang Tagalog  \n\n\nIf we were maybe Ilonggos we would have spoken Ilonggo\n\n\nBut they felt strongly that we should have a good grounding\n\n\nAnd that grounding was important for cognitive development as I later learned in in my undergraduate and graduate courses\n\n\nWhy because you have a conceptual base\n\n\nLanguage and thought are too closely interrelated\n\n\nIf the language of the environment is your predominant language is also your dominant language then it is  easier for you to strengthen that conceptual base\n\n\n Hindi ka lito  \n\n\nI have worked with college students who could not write a complete sentence U P  ito  who could not write a complete sentence in either English or Filipino\n\n\nAnd I would say to them  mag-desisyon ka nga  choose one language and use it but use it well okay\n\n\nAnd I think uhm if we give our younger children a firm base in Filipino from which to understand  'no para maging  framework  nila  for understanding not only other languages but especially mathematics especially science which are really uh heavily reliant on cognitive skills then we give them a firm foundation for literacy\n\n\nAnd we give them a firm foundation for critical thinking\n\n\nAnd that is why the choice of Filipino for  Batibot  many years ago was deliberate\n\n\nIt was not just a nationalistic fervor\n\n\nI was fully convinced as an educator that I must help we must help lay a firm foundation for that conceptual framework for that base from which children will make sense of their world\n\n\nLanguage and thought the two most interesting and most critical uhm tools that only human beings have\n\n\nThat 's the only thing that sets us apart really from the rest of the animal kingdom\n\n\nAnd every generation of young children must reinvent  'no  the use of that language\n\n\nSo uh that explains why until now if you think that  Batibot  should be in Filipino\n\n\nWe 've developed a Filipino Chinese program called \" Pin-pin \" to teach Hokkien  'no  to Filipino Chinese\n\n\nWe are working on a program that will be for older children seven and above that will be about media literacy and that will be bilingual\n\n\nBecause we then I think from seven onwards it 's important to teach in a very systematic way both English and Filipino to complement the school system\n\n\nBut we give them that strong base \n\n uhm is to teach children to value what it is to be Filipino okay\n\n\nWe want to teach them that uhm you can have a positive self-esteem and share it with other Filipinos, by appreciating first of all knowing knowing\n\n\nFor example there are children or even adults who tell me  'yung bubot pala trumpo 'yun  \n\n\n Alam n'yo ba 'yun 'yung bubot  \n\n\n Bubot  is a top\n\n\nIt 's a top that Ifugao children make\n\n\nAnd  sabi nila sa Batibot lang nila 'yan natutunan  \n\n\nOr certain words like uh in nineteen eighty-five to eighty-seven we approached the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and we and told them you want to reach more people at the time when it wasn't really in fashion yet to be pro-environment and to teach about protecting the environment\n\n\nWe said let 's do something on  Batibot  okay\n\n\nUhm four years later so first we started with introducing some basic concepts and we looked at the most severe environmental problems\n\n\nFirst  we teach  is domestic waste\n\n\n 'Yan ang  main problem  natin talaga 'no  \n\n\nWe are probably uh the most inefficient and really uncaring in in dealing with our waste", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f89b52c9-1595-4cb4-8db0-cf488f75a93a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.210993+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nUh thank you Dr Quirino\n\n\nUh before I begin uh let me thank uh first of all FUSE for extending\nthis invitation for us to disseminate to you the results of our  \nresearch for the past seven months and of course  Doktora  \nCortes uh the President of U E who was the one who recommended me to FUSE\n\n\nSo let 's begin\n\n\nThe one you see uh in front of you this is an aerial photo of uh\nManila taken in nineteen ninety-six\n\n\nOur project area is that uh area\n\n\nSo let 's begin with the title\n\n\nThe title of our project is \" Potential Initiatives for\nUrban Renewal of the University Belt in the City of Manila \" \n\n\nAs you can see this was funded by the U E Foundation for Research\nand Advanced Study through a grant from PAGCOR\n\n\nMay I may I at this point introduce my co-study leader uh who 's\nright at the center Environmental Planner Joel Oa&ntilde;a\n\n\nSo uh I think the word \" urban renewal \" has to be\ndefined here what we mean\n\n\nThis is really a development approach that aims to have a\nrevitalization of the urban environment\n\n\nAnd what is very critical here is community participation to be\nable to ensure sustainability\n\n\nSo let me go over very quickly the objectives of the study\n\n\nFirst we looked at what are the problems and issues and concerns in\nthis area particularly in the context of urban renewal public-private\npartnership and community governance\n\n\nAnd then based on an understanding of what these problems issues\nand concerns are we proceeded to have uh to draw up a preliminary area\ndevelopment framework\n\n\nThis led to the identification of the development initiatives\n\n\nWhen we say \" initiatives \" these are the some of\nthe proposed programs and projects that may be implemented in this area\n\n\nSo we also looked at what development schemes and policies uh that\nwe could introduce to be able to have a renewal of the University Belt and\nfinally it uh aims to create awareness that 's why we have this dissemination\nphase and possible partnerships particularly among the stakeholders in this\narea\n\n\nSo uh what would be the study area\n\n\nThis is our study area actually\n\n\nIt 's composed of six blocks covering fifteen hectares we begin\nwith Legarda going to Claro Recto Nicanor Reyes or Morayta P Campa then\nTortosa and M V de los Santos\n\n\nWe 'd like to clarify that the University Belt is very very large\n\n\nAnd because of the largeness of the area we needed to have a pilot\narea of six blocks which is a doable area to demonstrate that the private\nsector can come in and be involved in this\n\n\nThis is about thirty-seven percent of the land area of Zone\nforty-one and this falls within the fourth district of Manila\n\n\nNow our conceptual framework uh there there are three essential\nelements of urban renewal\n\n\nThat 's place people and partnership\n\n\nTo be able to understand the place we did an area resource\nassessment and we will present the findings to understand the the capability\nof the people to undertake urban renewal\n\n\nWe did an area capability assessment and based on an understanding\nof place and people we proceeded to identify what kinds of partnership may\ncome about\n\n\nAnd as you can see the word \" effectiveness \" is\nin red uh that really means to say that to be able to have a successful urban\nrenewal it is it is really premised on having effective partnerships on the\nground among the stakeholders\n\n\nSo what are the findings\n\n\nWe did the study uh in terms of a survey of students of U E which\nis about a large sample uh survey the these are the three major uh there will\nbe three major streets that will be shown to you\n\n\nSo what did the students say\n\n\nHow did they describe the area\n\n\nIn the order of description based on the most frequent frequently\ngiven answer, first it 's dangerous then it 's dirty it 's disorderly for\nthe following reasons there are many criminal elements there 's an L R T two\nconstruction on-going there are just too many people who are loitering aloun\naround there 's a lot of garbage dilapidated buildings inefficient drainage\nleading to flooding there 's congestion of traffic unsystematic parking and\nbasically noisy environment\n\n\nWe proceeded to ask about other streets that are vital F Dalupan\nwas asked this is Gastambide the old name\n\n\nThe same thing emerged in the order of  in the\norder of frequency of answers\n\n\nIt was described as dirty disorderly displeasing to the eye almost\nsimilar reasons given\n\n\nAnd the third one is S H Loyola this is the former Lepanto and R\nPapa\n\n\nAgain they said this place is dangerous dirty and disorderly\n\n\nThese are alarming answers coming from the major uh population who\nare frequenting the area which would be the students\n\n\nBased on this let us uh we tried to validate whether there 's any\nbasis for the students to say this or to describe the area\n\n\nSo we did part of the area resource assessment is a physical and\nvisual resource assessment\n\n\nSo what did we find here\n\n\nWe looked at it from both good and bad side\n\n\nAs you can see we 're  saying there are arcaded\nsidewalks like these\n\n\nThey represent very unique urban spatial character\n\n\nYou don't always see these arcaded walkways in other cities\n\n\nBut then what do we see under these uh uh arcaded walkways\n\n\nWe see sidewalk vendors uh that are in the area we see breaks in\nthe arcaded walkways so you get wet when you cross from one building to the\nother\n\n\nSo basically there 's non- adherence of some buildings to the\ndesign of the uh as given in this area\n\n\nBut then we looked at also are there historical sites here no\nmatter how dilapidated the area is\n\n\nWe did find some historical sites\n\n\nThis is  La Gota de Leche  \n\n\nThis is a, old old building nineteen O six which was used before\nas a feeding center and still continues to be one today and uh as you can see\nit is in a state requiring a lot of restoration and adaptive re-use\n\n\nThis is found along Lepanto\n\n\nNow walkways\n\n\nWe looked at the walkways\n\n\nThere are there 's really no unifying design they 're all different\n\n\nNow in terms of landscaping you can see some have trees some are\nwaste baskets already and some are just grasses\n\n\nThis is the state of the area\n\n\nNow uh because of the lack of public spaces where students can\ncongregate they tend to go of course to the shopping mall which is Ever\nGotesco and fast food chains like McDonalds Jollibee and Chowking\n\n\nSo there 's really no open spaces or public parks where they can\ncongregate\n\n\nNow we did a pedestrian count\n\n\nWe actually fielded counters on a straight eleven-hour basis just\nto find out how many people are walking in the streets\n\n\nClaro Recto has uhm about twenty-nine thousand eight hundred one\npeople or pedestrians uh followed by R Papa which connects F E U and U E and\nwhere you have P S B A and other schools about over twenty-five thousand and\nNicanor Reyes or Morayta which has about over twenty-five thousand\npedestrians at any given date of a straight eleven-hour\n\n\nYou can see that in the morning in rush  uh rush hour\nin the morning between eight and ten\n\n\nR Papa has the heaviest pedestrian movement\n\n\nAnd therefore you the reason I 'm giving stress to R Papa is\nbecause we have program recommendations for R Papa which connects a lot of\nschools\n\n\nNow there 's another major uh thing there which is on-going the\nconstruction of L R T two\n\n\nThis is the old Sampaloc uh site which will be the L R T two\nstation\n\n\nSo it really cuts across and that 's the reason why the students\nare saying that this is really basically disorderly because of the\nconstruction and this will be operational by two thousand four\n\n\nNext to the Sampaloc market the next station will be the old\nBilibid Prison  across Quezon Boulevard\n\n\nNow what about the traffic\n\n\nYou can see those big areas\n\n\nThis is where you have the choke points and choke points are caused\nby indiscriminated indiscriminate loading and unloading queuing of  \njeepneys  at intersections\n\n\nThere 's also narrow turning points like in this Lerma junction and\nof course uh pedestrians dash across the streets so they don't get run down\nplus of course  pedicabs  \n\n\nSo this is a concern which is uh validated when the students say\nthat it 's really quite dangerous to cross and a disorderly set up\n\n\nNow there 's also flooding there 's also as as seen in this picture\nand also seismic hazards because this is very close to the Quiapo Santa Cruz\narea which is a high risk area for earthquakes\n\n\nThe U-Belt really is uh because of the population size that\ntraverse it is a high solid waste generator\n\n\nAs you can see uh in this area this is a common sight where you\nhave these kinds of uh environmental problems\n\n\nNow we looked at the economic resource assessment as well and uh\nlet us let me share with you the findings\n\n\nWe did an actual establishment survey actually counting business\nestablishments\n\n\nAnd there are about three hundred thirty-six uh business\nestablishments the largest is services\n\n\nAnd this is understandable because they cater uh to principally to\nthe students\n\n\nNow in terms of the sidewalk vendors we call them the informal\nvendors they 're about hundred forty-one and they 're largely selling food\nand the others plus of course services like those uh of repair key\nduplication\n\n\nWhat 's the implication of this\n\n\nUhm when we looked at the establishments both registered and\nunregistered and we just looked at the universities along Claro Recto the\nratio is very high\n\n\nThere are about thirty-four establishments per hectare and about\nseventeen establishments per educational institution which means instead of\nhaving a dominant educational character in this area because of the presence\nof so many schools what is dominant is the commercial character\n\n\nSo there has to be a bit of a balance\n\n\nWe 're not saying we should remove commercial but it should be a\nbit more balanced than what it is today\n\n\nSocio-cultural resource assessment\n\n\nSo we looked at the people uh in the area and then we looked at the\nestablishments\n\n\nHere is a very interesting thing\n\n\nThe University Belt is very important\n\n\nIt 's historically significant because this is where the pioneers\nof tertiary education chose to locate\n\n\nStarting in nineteen O one with San Beda and La Consolacion\n\n\nThis is the Mendiola side\n\n\nAcross the bridge from Mendiola you have the non-sectarian schools\ncame about starting with the University of Manila in nineteen thirteen in\nnineteen twenty-eight with F E U and U E in nineteen forty-six\n\n\nSo really uh there is a lot of justification for having this\nrenewed because of that historical significance in terms of tertiary\neducation\n\n\nNow furthermore uh when you see this area in terms of\nsocio-cultural we found out that the resident population is very small\n\n\nIt 's roughly only about six thousand\n\n\nAnd we 're talking only of the pilot area not the entire\nUniversity Belt\n\n\nAnd then uh there are about in the tertial tertiary level about\nhundred thousand transient tertiary students who don't live there  no\n\n \n\n\nUh this is only considering eight colleges and universities\n\n\nSo what 's the implication the of this\n\n\nHaving a very small resident population which is serving a very\nlarge number of students who are not in fact their students they 're not\neconomically active\n\n\nThe implication is there 's a very high social service and\ninfrastructure burden imposed on the residents and local legitimate business\nthrough the tax system\n\n\nAnd you 're talking of garbage uh collection police protection\ntraffic management road repair and improvement\n\n\nSo what 's the consequence of this heavy burden\n\n\nWhen cost and capacity to pay for such services do not match\ncoupled with the very highly dense daytime population you would expect that\nwithout serious efforts on the part of different sectors you will have a\ndeterioration in the quality of urban services\n\n\nSo you have garbage you have traffic you have flooding\n\n\nThis is almost an automatic consequence of that\n\n\nSo what can we what can we do actually\n\n\nUh this is the challenge that the researches pose\n\n\nBecause of the importance of the educational sector in the history\nof the University Belt the challenge then to the affected universities is to\ntake a more active role in the  in the renewal of the urban\nenvironment where they operate\n\n\nAnd here you have six universities and colleges\n\n\nA Advance Academy now has a new name\n\n\nIt 's called Saint John Bosco Computer School very recently it has\na change in name\n\n\nThe challenge translates to having the community partnering with\nthe government to bringing about a better quality of life in the U-Belt\nparticularly for the students and the rest of the academic community\n\n\nThere 's a further justification of why we should move\n\n\nBecause as we have uh as I have shown to you there are historical\nassets here\n\n\nThere are also century-old institutions here like  \nColegio Medico Farmaceutico de Filipinas  University of Manila the\nP U P Rizal campus\n\n\nThese have been recognized by the National Historic Institute and\nare already reflected in the historical markers book of the N H I\n\n\nTherefore we 're saying preservation of the culture and heritage\n\n\nAnd this becomes another major argument for urban renewal in the\nUniversity Belt  1", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f083f766-d889-46c1-b87a-e807b275b6f6", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.212084+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nThank you for your kind introduction\n\n\nUh good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, \n\n\nToday 's  uh my paper this afternoon deals with the biological waste water treatment as applied to industrial and agricultural wastes\n\n\nAs a researcher interested in waste utilization and in biotechnology as a biochemical engineer, I have come to appreciate the conventional processes in industrial and agricultural waste treatment\n\n\nUsually organic uh industrial waste water are treated by the activated sludge process while agricultural wastes uh by an  aromic  anaerobic digestion\n\n\nI believe that applying the principles of environmental biotechnology and biochemical engineering, we can formulate more efficient treatment schemes,  \n\n\nI want to apologize if uh there will be some uh discrepancies because I did not have enough time to prepare because of the busy schedule during the past uh two months, \n\n\nBasically uh this is the outline of my paper, \n\n\nI will discuss some considerations in biological treatment schemes with some comparison of the those used for industrial and agricultural waste water\n\n\nAnd then I will discuss some of my uh recent research works\n\n\nAnd how I will uh get some of the distinguishing or uh advantageous features which you can integrate and adopt for a new process or a preferred uh process\n\n\nThat is we can use especially cultured microorganisms\n\n\nWe can improve the bio reactors and uh we can advocate the use of anaerobic fermentation, \n\n\nNow let 's have a comparison of the usual treatment schemes for industrial and agricultural waste water\n\n\nAs I said usually the activated sludge process is used for industrial uh waste water\n\n\nOf course these are for organic uh waste waters while uh anaerobic fermentation usually production of biogas is uh used for agricultural wastes\n\n\nWe know that the activated sludge process is an aerobic process and needs uh, oxygen while the, for agricultural waste it 's commonly the anaerobic process that is in the absence of oxygen\n\n\nThe activated sludge process needs tremendous power for aeration and agitation while in uh biogas production we have we can get methane that can be used as an energy source\n\n\nOf course from uh, the original design, we have had modifications such as the trickling filters fluidized bed packed bed and in the same manner in the in agricultural waste water there have been similar, uh modifications\n\n\nOf  and uh the latest, uh method is to immobilize or retain the microorganisms within the reactor, \n\n\nThis is the conventional activated sludge process\n\n\nYou have the aeration tank the clarifier and a  resecretion  system for the microorganisms, \n\n\nThen the modifications, this is the conventional uh, activated sludge process an aerator and a clarifier can be modified to be uh to have a flood flow configuration or in terms of a tapered aeration step aeration or contact stabilization where most of the sludge is uh revived, \n\n\nThe prime consideration is the aeration and here is where the expense uh of the process is\n\n\nThen these are the different uh further modifications quite some departures from the original type\n\n\nYou can have multi-stage you can have static mixers multi-tubes with recycle or with uh  external recycle and internal recycle, \n\n\nOne of the uh, design that is used and is very effective is a deep shaft process whereby by using a depth of uh as as high as fifty meters the solubilization of oxygen is higher, \n\n\nNow the aerobic treatment or as it is called the bio methanation process can have the traditional biogas systems\n\n\nThe example in particular here are those from uh China\n\n\nAnd then the different modifications you can see from the batch in a similar manner the development follows that of the activated sludge process\n\n\nFirst you can have uh from uh, from the batch to the fed-batch to continue a system stirred and complete flow\n\n\nNow uh also the the same uh principle in activated sludge is the retention or the recycling of microorganisms\n\n\nSo in this case you can have more efficient digestion by collecting the sludge or the microorganisms and recycling them\n\n\nAnd so on up to a modification of the sedimentation tank called the clarigester\n\n\nAgain with the fluidized bed and then the late the the in the seventies we have the uh high rate anaerobic filters such as the anaerobic filter you can have an up up flow where uh in these processes the microorganisms are retained by support materials can also have step processes\n\n\nAnd of course for uh solid waste you can use landfill, \n\n\nNow let us uh compare  the aerobic and anaerobic treatment\n\n\nThe aerobic process, proceeds in the presence of oxygen and leads to the  mineralization of the organic matter into carbon dioxide and water\n\n\nAnd some of these are used in the production of the sludge or the microorganisms while in the anaerobic process the organic matter is reduced to ethanol methane acetate and butanol\n\n\nBecause of the use of aerators the aerobic process is energy intensive\n\n\nLess energy is used by the anaerobic process and in the and it also produces extra energy\n\n\nThe metabolism in aerobic process is faster so that microorganisms multiply very well\n\n\nIn anaerobic uh fermentation microorganisms grow slowly\n\n\nBecause of this we have faster reaction rate in aerobic processes while slower in anaerobic process\n\n\nAnd this leads to shorter retention time in  aerobic processes usually uh eight hours and longer retention times in anaerobic process could be five to ten days\n\n\nSo while the energy uh, requirement is the major expense of the aerobic process the size of the anaerobic uh treatment plant is  is uh larger, \n\n\nNow the next consideration is the use of uh, uh especially cultured microorganisms\n\n\nThe activated sludge process or even uh, the anaerobic digestion uses naturally occurring microorganisms\n\n\nNow we can speed up the process by using cultured microorganisms\n\n\nWe know that the fermentation process is due to enzymes\n\n\nAnd if we can employ enzymes, from uh efficient producers then we can speed up the reaction\n\n\nUsually we can get as a result faster reaction, higher loading rate formation of sludge is rest\n\n\nAnd sometimes uh some of these microorganisms are facultative so that you can cut off the oxygen supply some hours in a day for energy savings\n\n\nNow these microorganisms are available commercially, \n\n\nAnd this is an example of a commercial product used for treating uh for instance phenols uh phenol containing wastes biphenols waste containing organic solvent residues aromatic hydrocarbon, \n\n\nSo when the for the activated sludge process, the problem is when the wastes contain poorly degradable substances or synobiotics and other toxic compounds, some uhm microorganisms can treat this\n\n\nFor instance pesticides uh chloroaromatics or even oil uh containing uh waters can be treated, \n\n\nNow the, by using these especially cultured microorganisms we can improve the performance of activated sludge, process but then we still need to provide the energy for aeration\n\n\nNow if we are able to use anaerobic processes then uh the expense for aeration will be eliminated\n\n\nAnd actually the anaerobic fermentation should have been the vogue of the researches in nineteen eighties\n\n\nHowever it was overshadowed by the development in genetic engineering where aerobic processes for uh, some uh biochemical substances have been used\n\n\nSo this is to the application\n\n\nSo it is expected that in the future beginning in the nineties the use of the of anaerobic fermentation will be the more efficient process\n\n\nNow I will present some of my researches that is directly related to this and uh in the future I have already have plans to go into this uh research that is anaerobic fermentation\n\n\nFor instance in production of acetic acid this is done by uh fermentation or uh the oxidation of ethanol\n\n\nWe know that in biogas production there are microorganisms or bacteria that produce acetic acid\n\n\nBut of course the problem is how, to speed up the growth of these anaerobic microorganisms\n\n\nNow I will present a case study on the treatment of waste waters high in phenol content\n\n\nAs I have said the microorganisms are available commercially\n\n\nHowever the technology to utilize these microorganisms is either not available or they are very expensive\n\n\nSo even if you buy these microorganisms which cost around one thousand pesos per kilo, you will not be able to use them, \n\n\nNow uh, there is a company in the Philippines that produces  two-four D  two-four dichlorophenoxy acetic acid as a herbicide\n\n\nThis is the structure, \n\n\nThis is the manufacturing process\n\n\nUh  two-four D  is produced from uh the reaction of, two-four dichlorophenol and uh sodium the sodium salt of uh chloroacetic acid\n\n\nAnd in the process this is neutralized with sulfuric acid\n\n\nAnd this is where most of the pollutants come from the high acidic high acidity uh between one and two P H and the unreacted two-four dichlorophenol and the chlorophenoxy acetic acid\n\n\nNow uh in this process this rest which is just the modification of the  two-four D  acid produces little or no waste water at all\n\n\nSo the problem of the plant is really in this portion\n\n\nThis is the waste water characteristic and uh you can see the C O D up to fifteen thousand which is uh non-biodegradable very difficult to degrade\n\n\nThe phenol as high as five hundred parts per million, very high uh I mean very low P H\n\n\nAnd uh these are the major pollutant, \n\n\nNow I did some uh experiments in batch processes and uh these are the characteristics of the microorganisms available commercially\n\n\nYou have to supply it with fertilizer ratio ten to one for every one hundred parts of C O D, \n\n\nNow this is some of the results obtained up as high as uh ninety-eight percent reduction of phenol\n\n\nBut however you can note the length of time requires about four days\n\n\nOf course this depends on also on the amount of microorganisms so we can go maybe twenty-four between twenty-four and thirty-six hours, \n\n\nThe C O D is reduced up to ninety percent\n\n\nNow from the result of these batch studies, we came out with a process similar to the activated sludge uh process where we have the we neutralize it first aerate then clarify and return the sludge\n\n\nHowever we encountered problem, \n\n\nThat is due to the size small size of the microorganisms it will not settle it will be difficult to recycle them\n\n\nIt will just overflow with the effluent\n\n\nNow we we found the solution that is to simulate the activated sludge process\n\n\nOr another uh alternative is to condition the activated sludge to high phenol contents\n\n\nBut then we have to dilute the waste water by six hundred times, \n\n\nThe solution used is that we can use activated carbon powdered or silica gel to use as a carrier or support material of the microorganisms\n\n\nNow the <unclear> 1 word </unclear> are provided so that they are easily fluidized by introduction of air\n\n\nAnd then we can recycle this carrier\n\n\nAnd some is disposed or reprocessed\n\n\nWe did this by, designing this type of aerator which is essentially a plug-flow uh starting feed and this uh providing a clarifier which will recycle part of the microorganisms\n\n\nAnd then continue into the third uh compartment going to the effluent\n\n\nNow this is uh the uh plan view neutralized waste water goes in\n\n\nThese are the aerators clarified here and then the sludge is returned\n\n\nWhile uh some goes on to the next stage finally clarified and the effluent uh polished\n\n\nWe were able to get the final uh, phenol content to as low as one or point five P P M, \n\n\nThis is uh the result with uh using support material and that is recycling\n\n\nWe got uh almost similar result\n\n\nIn this manner we can retain the microorganism and recycle them, \n\n\nWe were not able to uh construct the original set up plan but in this case we had three containers or three stages with uh recycling in each stage, \n\n\nYou can see foam uh while aeration and in fermentation you can tell the microorganisms are happy if foam is forming\n\n\nNow we had this uh first the design parameters we used\n\n\nThis is now for the treatment of the plant usually we we estimated this using the parameters for activated sludge because uh for the process the we have no basis yet for the design\n\n\nAnd according to this estimate, about uh one million over one million or at the cost now it could be two million", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f7bba7bd-0b67-494a-8a87-7cdc38654d68", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nToday I decided not to speak on education because it 's I think\nover-discussed over-talked and still no action\n\n\nSo it 's there is a sense of frustration on my part that despite the\nvery familiar and well-known problems of education in this country not not\nmuch in terms of policy change in terms of uh of reform initiatives have\ntaken place\n\n\nAnd uh so I said I 'm going to choose another topic which also\naffects in a way not directly but affects in a way our educational our\neducation our standards our or or the state of education and that is\ncorruption  e  corruption in our country, \n\n\nI have a Powerpoint  here like like Dan 's\nintroduction it 's also a summary also a summary presentation\n\n\nThis will not be the last word on the state of corruption in our\ncountry\n\n\nBut I 'd like to sketch to you in general terms the magnitude of uh\nofficial and political corruption in our country and uh how in my mind it\naffects the the even the direction of our country\n\n\nSo let me begin by saying that the stench of corruption is the only\nconstant it seems in our public life\n\n\nFor every peso for every peso spent on infrastructure projects and\nthe procurement of goods and services you know public bidding for goods and\nservices between twenty to fifty centavo of that peso is lost to corruption\n\n\nSo if you have a let 's just for simplicity a one hundred peso road\nthat road is only fifty peso worth so very very shallow and one night of rain\nwill be washed away, \n\n\nNow this is the this is an official study an official study\nconducted by the World Bank not just of the Philippines but of uh of several\nmember nations of the world in uh last year\n\n\nYou see the magnitude of money of public resources lost to official\ncorruption in the last twenty years forty-eight billion U S dollars and as of\ntwenty O one that would have been sufficient to pay off our debt our foreign\ndebt\n\n\nYou know I attended an anti-corruption conference in Ottawa in the\nmiddle of October\n\n\nOne of the resource persons is the president of the World Institute\nwhich initiated this study and gave an overview of corruption in the world\n\n\nAnd I really sat so embarrassed because he cited us specifically as\none country that has not done anything to stem the tide of corruption\n\n\nWell this is familiar data the Transparency International a\nBerlin-based monitoring and surveillance agency last August issued this  this uh finding\n\n\nOur country is the eleventh most corrupt among one hundred two\ncountries that places us in the same category as  Pakistan  Zimbabwe and Romania\n\n\nI think that this uh level of corruption is also eating up into our\ncompetitive status into our competitiveness\n\n\nBecause another study by the World Economic Forum which is a\nGeneva-based uh uh group of uh businessmen that holds regular fora all over\nthe world came up with this competitiveness <unclear> 1 word </unclear> \n\n\nLast year we were forty-eight number forty-eight in the\ncompetitiveness ranking today just one year later we have dropped to\nsixty-one a change of thirteen thirteen levels\n\n\nThe same group the World Economic Forum has a Public Institution\nIndex and the components of this index is how we administer contracts what is\nthe state of our law the independence of the judiciary  etcetera\n\n and the other is the corruption level\n\n\nHow do we rank in the Public Institution Index\n\n\nLast year we were number sixty-three today this year barely a year\nwe have dropped to number seventy\n\n\nSo the the pace the pace and and character of corruption in our\ncountry is is on a rapid decline rather on a rapid rise\n\n\nNow how much does our country lose every year in terms of purchase\nof goods and equipment and the commissioning of civil works\n\n\nThat is the calculation not by us the opposition that is the\ncalculation of our own Department of Budget\n\n\nWe 're losing twenty-two billion pesos a year  on\naccount of corruption in the public bidding process\n\n\nWhat can twenty-two billion do\n\n\nThis is a rough translation of what twenty-two billion a year if we\nhave that can do\n\n\nWell it can we can build forty-four thousand seven hundred new\nclassrooms we can buy twenty-four million new books we can purchase four\nmillion desks and acquire forty-four thousand computers new computers\n\n\nSo if we can only save on what we lose through corruption I think\nthis perennial school crisis that we encounter every school opening of lack\nof classrooms lack of teachers lack of desks and textbooks can be alleviated\n\n\nWe I think we we remain the only country in the whole of North and\nSouth East Asia with the largest class size\n\n\nOur class size is averaging fifty-five to sixty pupils per per per\nclass\n\n\nChina with one point two billion pesos  \nhas a class size of only thirty-two thirty-two pupils\n\n\nMalaysia Malaysia and Singapore of course they are relatively\nprosperous has a class size of nineteen\n\n\nSo that that measures the magnitude of the lack of basic basic uh\nneeds of the education sector in our country\n\n\nNow but what can we do\n\n\nShould we just uh uh tell each other and relate this sad story to\neach other and not do anything\n\n\nWhat can be done as a practical doable way\n\n\nI suggest that uh this I think this can be done\n\n\nNumber one we must strengthen the oversight function of Congress\n\n\nUnfortunately our people the public doesn't doesn't think that  that Congress could be a redeeming factor which is quite\nunfortunate and that congressional investigation helps\n\n\nBut in in any in any parliamentary democracy Congress oversight\nfunction is an effective deterrence to public wrongdoing of government\n\n\nSo we we ought to to do this and strengthen the oversight function\nof Congress\n\n\nWe must reform the the public bidding process of our country\n\n\nThe the bidding process of our country which requires a\npre-qualification uh stage then a main main evaluation is so designed that it\ncan be easily manipulated\n\n\nFor instance my own experience in the Department of Agriculture\nwhen we were bidding out not just millions but billions of pesos for\nirrigation projects shows that in the pre-qualification process itself you\ncan already favor the contractor you want\n\n\nSomehow they 're able to to arrange that a favored contractor and a\nfavored contractor is usually one who can give the most is chosen even before\nahead of the main evaluation of the uh tenders\n\n\nSo I have filed and I am I have we are now debating in the plenary\na Government Procurement Reform Act and this essentially this essentially\ncontains the the following requirements\n\n\nWe are now going to announce bids not just in a newspaper but uh\nbut in the Internet we 'll put we 'll post it on the web site\n\n\nEvery government agency must post it on the web site\n\n\nThis practice of putting a floor also deprives government of the\nopportunity to get really the best price because usually the the floor set\nthe floor set is generally higher than what the market tells us\n\n\nWe 're going to prohibit or at least regulate the so-called price\nadjustments and change orders\n\n\nWhat what does what does this mean\n\n\nWhen you are a contractor you will bid and you will submit probably\na ridiculously low low bid\n\n\nAnd under our rules since the lowest bidder is the is awarded the\ncontract then I will get the contract but after we 've concluded the contract\nI will ask the agency to change I will submit a change order or the agency\nwill submit a change order\n\n\nAnd it 's not unusual that the original bid which won can be\ndoubled through these change orders and price adjustment\n\n\nThe classic case of that is the so-called Diosdado Macapagal Avenue\n\n\nIt doubled not because of the original bidded price but because of\nchange orders\n\n\nThe contractor won it because he really underbidded everybody and\nby our rules he he got the contract\n\n\nWe 're now going to impose a five-year warranty which there is none\nas of the moment\n\n\nA contractor can build that road to your village in one year it may\nbe wiped out by the rains and he 's not liable at all even if you can\ndemonstrate that he put in less gravel he put in less cement\n\n\nAnd finally this open and competitive public bidding\n\n\nAs I said tenders now will be placed on the Internet on the web\nsite\n\n\nAnyone anywhere in this country can bid\n\n\nSo we hope that uh by making public bidding more open and more\ntransparent we would at least reduce the incidence of under-the-table and\ncorrupt practices\n\n\nThe third uh the third area of concern to us is campaign finance\n\n\nIn this country you can really pinpoint the business interests the\nbusinessmen who regularly finance electoral campaigns whether for president\nor senators or congressmen or\n\n\nAnd maybe I am exaggerating but Sonny knows this there are regulars\nthey 're professional fund uh campaign donors year in election after election\nthey are the regular regulars\n\n\nBut when you are elected as a result of the support of this these\nfew who do you think you owe your allegiance or your loyalty\n\n\nDo you think you can really introduce radical and structural reform\nin business in the society if your funder or his interests will be hurt\n\n\nBut that is the traditional state of campaign finance in our\ncountry\n\n\nBut there is a new even more sinister funding source and that is\nthe gambling and the drug and the drug lords\n\n\n Jueteng  lords have always funded especially the\nlocal elections but we 've seen that even national elections have been\nsupported by  jueteng  lords and we 've tolerated it I think\nand we have not made any outcry at all up to now\n\n\nBut we are seeing drug money going into the electoral uh system and\nto me that is that is so dangerous\n\n\nAnd that 's why that 's uh we I I put together with other Senators\na Campaign Finance Reform Act and I 've convinced my colleagues in the House\nto file it too\n\n\nThat will may not eliminate it totally but at least bring it out\ninto the open compel candidates and donors to disclose their donations in the\nsame manner that many countries outside the Philippines have done so\nconsistently and uniformly in the past two or three years\n\n\nWe 're the only country now remaining without a Campaign Finance\nReform Act\n\n\nBecause when you come come to think of it maybe the state of\npolitics in this country is such because we 've not taken care of the way we\nare financing and choosing our leaders\n\n\nAnd if unless we do something about it I think we will be\nperpetually held hostage by vested interests gambling and other illegal\nactivities syndicates as well as drug drug lords\n\n\nNow let me go back to effective oversight, \n\n\nReally if uh if our parliamentarians realize the the good that can\nbe achieved by the proper exercise of of parliamentary oversight of\ncongressional oversight I think we will we will it will serve a very powerful\ndeterrence to wrongdoing in government\n\n\nBut unfortunately as I said you know people don't look very kindly\non Congress and on our investigation and that 's why it 's important that we\ninvest our Congress that quality of integrity and credibility otherwise we\nwill never we 'll never be able to effectively provide the check and balance\nthat we need in in our country\n\n\nAnd also that means that the committees and and its staff must be\nwell-trained and well-motivated\n\n\nI 've been to to several international fora discussing all this and\nI 'm really quite impressed at the efforts being exerted by many parliaments\nby many governments in providing support in terms of training and resources\nto to parliaments and and the professional staff which we are not doing in\nthis country, \n\n\nNow let me  go back again to the political\nparties\n\n\nWe must also worry about the political parties because political\nparties both in theory and practice is supposed to be the the screening\nmechanism by which we select potential leaders of our society and of our\npolitics and supposed to provide the training and the orientation to them\n\n\nThat 's not being performed by any political party in this country\n\n\nBecause as you very well know and I 'll repeat the trite remark\npolitical parties in this country are more factions rather than genuine\npolitical parties based on ideology based on programs it 's more\npersonalistic than you can ever find\n\n\nI just attended over the weekend an international conference of\npolitical parties of Asia and uh and uh many political parties in Asia except\nthe except the totalitarian states really have a competitive party system\n\n\nThey look to the parties to to influence the course and content of\npublic policy and through their selection of the present and future leaders\nthey really make a big impact on the society\n\n\nNow what is the bane of our political parties apart from the lack\nof ideology\n\n\nWhy is it that it 's so easy to leave your party and join another\n\n\nThe  yung balimbing   I think that 's unique to us\n\n\nI think that that 's also a function of the of the political system\n\n\nOur political system is a winner-take-all system\n\n\nUh  pag natalo ka talagang talo ka e   you 're wiped out and all the all the patronage and\nthe advantages go to the winner who now dispense the perks and the pork\nbarrels\n\n\nBut that 's not I think the main goal of of the party system just\nto patronage and all but yet that is how it operates in our country  3", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThank you very much and good afternoon\n\n\nUh how many of you are familiar with N L P already\n\n\nAnything that you know about N L P, \n\n\nOkay uh spelled out  'no  we use N L P to really mean neurolinguistic programming\n\n\nAnd when we talk about neurolinguistic programming this involves looking into the nervous system\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nAnd when we talk about the nervous system we focus on the five senses that I hope you remember from your grade school years\n\n\nWhat are the five senses\n\n\n Bakit kayo sa  touch  nag-uumpisa ha   \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nTouch\n\n\nOkay sight hearing, taste and smell  'no  \n\n\nOkay the idea here is that we get in touch with the world and we experience the world through the five senses\n\n\nAnd this is what uh the neuro aspect of N L P refers to\n\n\nSo we become aware of the world we become uh familiar with many things about the world and then we respond to the world in terms also of these five senses that we have\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nNow the linguistic aspect focuses on the fact that we use language whether consciously or unconsciously internally or externally to represent this experience of the world that we have\n\n\nLike for instance  'no  when you 're feeling warm internally you may be saying  ang init naman  you know\n\n\nThen  nagpapaypay ka  \n\n\nOr for instance uh a very handsome man passes by  'no  you may not really be saying it verbally but internally you might say  ang gwapo  you know like that\n\n\nSo whatever comes in contact with a part of your or with one of your senses gets to be linguistically represented  'no  \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nAnd then the programming aspect means that we really systematize our responses to the various experiences that we have\n\n\nSo we systematize  'no  we encode and we decode certain uh messages\n\n\nNow as we grow then some aspects of responding become patterned\n\n\nThat 's why it 's already programmed  'no  we are sort of programmed okay\n\n\nNow uhm so that 's what basically the three words would mean\n\n\nNow simply speaking N L P says really that this may be the world that we really have  'no  \n\n\nOkay this is the world that we really have\n\n\nBut we may not experience the world as it really is\n\n\nIf this is the big world which we might be able to respond to actually we just make representations of the world or we make maps or models of the world  'no  \n\n\nOkay uh if you think about a model airplane what comes to your mind, huh\n\n\nSomething what, that looks like an airplane from the outside but it 's a small version so it cannot really function the way a real airplane would  'no  \n\n\nIt cannot fly or perhaps if it flies only within certain parameters or only within a certain period of time\n\n\nAnd it may not be able to accommodate passengers just as the real airplane would be able to  'no  \n\n\nSo in a way when we make models or maps of the world the models that we make may resemble the real world but may not actually possess all the faculties or the functions of the real world\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nNow so supposing uh you there are three of you one 's model of the world may be bigger the other one 's may be smaller and the third person 's model may be even smaller\n\n\nNow the smaller the model of our world is then the less it approximates or the less it resembles the real world\n\n\nYou 'll notice that  'no  \n\n\nA globe is a model of the world\n\n\n Hindi ba 'yung  globe has all the countries of the world and the the shapes and all that\n\n\nBut the smaller the globe is  'no  the less countries it can contain  'no  \n\n\nMaybe the Philippines might not even be found in that small model or the small globe\n\n\nSo that is it  'no  \n\n\nPeople develop different sizes of the models of the world\n\n\nThe problem is, some people 's model of the world may be so small  'no  that it really incorporates very little of the big world\n\n\nAnd the smaller our world model is then the more  tamed  we can be the more problems we have\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nNow what makes the world model small or big  'no  \n\n\nMaybe we can talk about it being smaller than the actual world model because there are constraints that we experience\n\n\nWhat are some of the constraints of the uh modeling process  'no  \n\n\nOne would be that we have nervous system constraints \n\n\nUh there are neurological constraints\n\n\nLike for instance  'no  if I ask you right now right now at this point what are you aware of, okay, \n\n\nOkay can you enumerate what you became aware of, \n\n\nYou 're aware that you 're hungry okay\n\n\nWhat about you what are you what were you aware of when I asked that, \n\n\nHaving a lecturer in front of you\n\n\nAnd what about you\n\n\nOkay you were aware that you were listening  'no  okay\n\n\nSo three of them had different areas uh  uh where they were aware of or  of which they were aware  'no  \n\n\nNow uh the thing is there are many things that you could have been aware of at that given moment  'no  \n\n\nLike uh some of you might have been aware of this microphone stand or the podium or the box here or the tables there the chair the chair there the lights the sound of the air conditioner the picture over there the people around you\n\n\nYou could have been aware of such things\n\n\nBecause they were in existence during the time that I asked you what are you aware of  'no  \n\n\nBut see some of you were focused or uh just one or two items at that given moment  'no  \n\n\nAccording to the proponents of uh neurolinguistic   Bundler  'no  and Grinder we can be aware only of seven plus two chunks chunks  'no  seven plus two chunks of information at any given time\n\n\nSo  bale  a maximum of nine information at any given time  'no  \n\n\nLike and we say \" chunks \" \n\n\nLike you can say I am aware of this specific person this specific person this specific person\n\n\nYou 're saying I am aware of people I am  that 's a chunk of information\n\n\nI am aware of chairs  'no  \n\n\nI am aware of the sound system rather than different sounds specifically  'no  \n\n\nSo at any given time we will only be aware of seven plus two chunks of information\n\n\nTherefore our nervous system already limits  'no  \n\n\nWhat we do not become aware of do not become part of this world model okay\n\n\nNow we are also limited by our language  'no  uh\n\n\nLike some of you may be coming from one region another a few may come from another region and you might have different dialects  'no  \n\n\nLet us say somebody is somebody is from Iloilo  'no  and he 's talking to a Tagala  'no  okay\n\n\nNow this Ilonggo had a very very uhm fantastic experience  'no  \n\n\nAnd as she is describing it in Ilonggo she can describe it very very well in very very specific more felt ways\n\n\nBut then this Tagala says I cannot understand what you are saying you translate it to Tagalog\n\n\nAnd then when she translates it to Tagalog   nahirapan siya  or the meanings of the experience are lost already\n\n\n Parang  it doesn't sound so good anymore\n\n\nLike for instance  'no  when you say in  let 's say the Tagalogs  'no  in Tagalog you say  nalulungkot ako 'no  \n\n\nThat 's Tagalog  'no  \n\n\nWhen you say  nalulungkot  yeah there 's a certain element of sadness and you just feel that something is missing something is lacking  'no  \n\n\nBut if a person can say  nawiwindang ang puso ko 'no  it has it gives you a different feeling\n\n\n Di ba  \n\n\n Nalulungkot  there 's a certain sense of sadness  kasi  something is missing something is lacking\n\n\nBut  nawiwindang  means there is something more actively eating you up or devastating you  'no  \n\n\nThat 's why when you say I 'm sad rather than I am devastated it has a different meaning\n\n\nNow if you cannot use the more accurate terms to graphically describe your experiences your world model may be smaller\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nNow for instance I ask you what 's another word for \" snow \", \n\n\n Ano, yelo,  \n\n\n Ano pa  \n\n\n Nieve  \n\n\n Ano pa  \n\n\n Trinanslate n'yo na sa  different languages\n\n\n O ano pa  \n\n\nOkay\n\n\n Tayo 'no  we have a hard time really translating\n\n\nSome people would say another word for \" snow \" is \" ice \" \n\n\nBut you make an image of ice and you make an image of snow are they the same\n\n\n Hindi ano  \n\n\n Di ba  \n\n\n Ganyan  \n\n\nBut the Eskimos  'no  okay the people from Alaska they don't want to be called \" Eskimo \" anymore\n\n\nSo the people  'no  from the cold cold place  'no  have seventy different words for snow\n\n\nSo  alam nila kung ano 'yung  snow  'yung pwedeng paglaruan kung ano 'yung  snow  na pwede nilang i-  expose  ang sarili nila puwede ring uh lumabas 'no  or go out only for necessities or don't go out at all\n\n\nThey know which kind of snow would be harmful by the use of the different terms\n\n\nBut we cannot find a synonym for \" snow \" because we are not exposed to snow at all okay\n\n\nThat is the linguistic uh constraint  'no  \n\n\nAnd we also have what we call individual constraints in this world uh building  'no  \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause we are individuals we have unique experiences and we have unique interpretations of the experiences\n\n\nSo our individual histories can affect how we will view the world\n\n\nLike for instance  'no  uh if you have a girl who grew up in a family  where the father was very loving the mother was very caring  'no  and she felt very much loved\n\n\nAnd you have another girl whose father abandoned them when they were young and whose mother committed suicide or attempted suicide several times  'no  \n\n\nWho would have a better outlook about relationships with the opposite sex\n\n\nThe first one  'di ba  \n\n\n Kasi siya 'yung tingin niya ah maganda ang  marriage  maganda mag-  fall in love you will be happy and all that\n\n\nBut the other one may huh I 'm not saying automatically she would  'no  but the other one may be very skeptical or very cynical about the permanency of love or the fact that love really exists  'no  \n\n\nSo  ang tingin nila ang ang  world model  nila  would be different  'no  \n\n\nThe other one would say oh being in love is a beautiful thing marriage is a beautiful thing\n\n\nBut the other one may say marriage is a dangerous thing  'no  \n\n\nSo that becomes part of their world model\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nAre you clear\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nNow those are the constraints that I said would affect the size of your world model\n\n\nNow there are also what we call uh the universals of the human modeling process\n\n\nFor instance I say to you can you complete the sentence A man with a moustache is \n\n\nCan you answer that\n\n\nCan you complete that sentence A man with a moustache is, uhm\n\n\nFor you, \" is old \", \" is mature-looking \", uhm \" is big \" \n\n\nOkay what about this gentleman, \n\n\n\" Is different \" okay\n\n\nWhat about the one beside you\n\n\nA man with a moustache is, \n\n\nJust for you don't ask anybody, \" is bad \" \n\n\nNext, \" masculine \", \" is not a woman \" okay  \n\n\n Kanta 'yan ng Apo Hiking ano  uhm\n\n\n O ano pa, ha  \n\n\n\" Good looking \" okay\n\n\n\" Scary \" okay\n\n\n\" Dirty-looking \" \n\n\n\" Old \" okay\n\n\nYou notice that I asked several of you  'no  \n\n\nTwo people answered old one answered mature looking\n\n\nSomeone answered uh cute I heard it I overheard it\n\n\nSomebody said scary\n\n\nSomebody said bad\n\n\nSomebody said good looking  'no  \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nYou have a different kind of response  'no  for each person\n\n\nNow when you see  na  therefore  'no  depending upon the response that you gave when you see a man with a moustache what is the likely response that you will have or reaction that you will have  'no  \n\n\n Pag sinabi mong  scary or bad  'no kahit na sino pa siya basta meron siyang bigote matatakot ka  or  iiwasan mo pag sinabi mong macho lalapitan mo 'no  cute  lalapitan mo di ba kahit ano pa siya\n\n\nThis is what we call a generalization  'no  \n\n\nwe are saying okay you 're answering once when a man with a moustache is cute\n\n\nBut when you really see men with moustaches are they really cute all of them\n\n\nNo  di ba  \n\n\nOkay are they really all bad\n\n\n Hindi naman 'no  \n\n\nAre they really all scary\n\n\n Hindi   \n\n\nAre they really all macho\n\n\n Hindi naman 'no  \n\n\nSo you will notice that there is a really really a difference\n\n\nBut the thing is sometimes we have a generalization  'no  \n\n\nWe generalize that just because a person has this attribute or an experience occurred then it will have the same outcome  'no  \n\n\nLike for instance one generalization that we can have is this  kunyari  umaakyat tayo ng hagdanan ano tapos nahulog tayo 'no tapos nabalian tayo  okay\n\n\nThen what happens every time that you see that staircase what happens\n\n\n Natatakot ka na 'no nag-ge-generalize ka na na komo nahulog ka noon mahuhulog ka na naman hindi ba  \n\n\nAnd you forgot perhaps the one hundred times before that you climbed up that staircase and you did not fall\n\n\nYou only remember that particular time that you fell that 's why every time that you approach that staircase  medyo sumasakit ang tiyan mo o kaya ingat ka hawak 'no  you really hold on very very tightly  'no  \n\n\nOkay so you generalize",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nYou know uhm  I just wanna say thank you for uh inviting me over to share with you a little bit of myself uh more than just my music\n\n\nUhm I can see that uh all of you are uh uh  \n\n\nYou know I hardly  \n\n\nIs it okay if I just talk from here\n\n\nOkay  lang 'no  because uh I do have some\n\n\nI I wrote down some things that I 'd like to share with you and it will be easier for me to just use this if that 's okay with you\n\n\nOkay  lang  \n\n\nOkay,  \n\n\nOkay uhm you know before I begin I just like to tell you all that when I got the invitation to come over to speak to all of you it was uhm a very big surprise 'cause usually when I 'm invited to come over to the D L S U it 's usually to perform\n\n\nBut tonight it 's not uh this afternoon is not a performance you know\n\n\nI 'd like this to be as casual as possible\n\n\nAnd later on I 'm opening the floor to whatever questions you might have or whatever questions you might want to ask me\n\n\nI don't want it to be you know like a forty-five minute talk on just you know a one-sided talk\n\n\nI want it to be you know like what it says you know a dialogue\n\n\nFirst of all I 'd like to introduce myself\n\n\nI 'm Gary Valenciano\n\n\nAnd the reason why I wanna do this is because sometimes or most of the time people say you know and now here he is without any further introduction \n\n\nBut actually there 's a lot of things I 'd like to share with you\n\n\nI 'd like to give you a little background on who Gary Valenciano is\n\n\nFirst of all I 'm uh the sixth of seven in the family\n\n\nThere are two boys and five girls uhm\n\n\nI 've been a La Sallite since nineteen seventy-one\n\n\nI studied in the States in nineteen seventy-nine and I came back in nineteen eighty\n\n\nAnd I entered uh La Salle Greenhills again\n\n\nIn nineteen eighty-two I joined the  Kundirana   and it was the beginning it was the start of a new chapter in my life that has been going on since then\n\n\nNineteen eighty-three I entered De La Salle Taft and uhm it was also in nineteen eighty-three that I turned professional in my singing career\n\n\nNineteen eighty-three also was the year where I met my wife Angeli\n\n\nAnd uh that 's also another chapter that has been going strong ever since then\n\n\nIn nineteen eighty-four I did my first movie and uh which was entitled Hotshots and I did my first uhm major concert entitled Gary V Live at the Araneta Coliseum\n\n\nAnd then nineteen eighty-five uh well nineteen eighty-four also introduced Reaching Out into the airwaves\n\n\nNineteen eighty-five I joined the Tokyo music fest and  Di Na Natuto  came out\n\n\nIn nineteen eighty-six  Paano Huwag Mo Na Sanang Isipin  uh and Take Me Out Of The Dark uh started being played\n\n\nEighty-seven  Eto Na Naman  \n\n\nEighty-eight was a U S tour and a U S album that I recorded\n\n\nEighty-nine Take Me Out Of The Dark again was uh aired\n\n\nNotice  'no  from eighty-six to eighty-nine it was only in nineteen eighty-nine that Take Me Out was really played on the airwaves\n\n\nIn nineteen ninety uhm, the songs Look In Your Eyes and Each Passing Night and songs like that came out and Major Impact was staged\n\n\nUhm in nineteen ninety-one I had the privilege of performing for the very first time uh at the Amphitheater in Los Angeles\n\n\nI recorded another album this time in Japan under Toshiba E M I Records to be released on June of nineteen ninety-two\n\n\nAnd you know I can go on you know I 'm telling you all the wonderful things that I 've gone through\n\n\nNow some of you may ask how does Gary V do it \n\n\nOr some of you might have you know why is Gary V telling us you know giving us all this information about what he has accomplished \n\n\nWell definitely this is not being shared with you to impress you with the things that I 've done because frankly speaking this was not done by me you know\n\n\nThis was all just given to me\n\n\nIt is my way of revealing to you the secret of my success\n\n\nAnd maybe impress you with the one who has given me all this and much much more\n\n\nFor one who never used to dance or write music or play any instrument you know like me and received you know and yet received all this one cannot help but say to all who wonder and who care to listen that one that the one who takes full credit is Christ Jesus himself and no other\n\n\nHe has been the sustaining force behind all of what you see and hear of me today\n\n\nHe is the rock that my family is built on\n\n\nHe is the one who has put me and my wife together and the one who will keep us together through all the ups and downs that life has to offer\n\n\nHe is the one who has given me my music\n\n\nHe is the rhythm of my soul\n\n\nAnd he is the one who has given me my fans and my friends like you\n\n\nAnd he is the one who has come not just for people like me but for you as well\n\n\nAnd I guess this is what you 've always heard of Gary V you know uhm uh having this kind of relationship with the Lord\n\n\nBut I can go on and on and on talking about it but I know that there are questions in some of your minds about my faith about the industry about uh what the future is for Gary V about what the future is for the industry\n\n\nAnd that 's why I 'd like to open up the floor you know for you to ask any question\n\n\nI want you all to treat this like not  uy  you know we 're getting to meet Gary V but, \n\n\nI mean I 've been around for nine years now and I just want you to treat me like the way you treat any friend of yours you know if you have any question just ask\n\n\nI 'm opening up the floor now\n\n\nWe 've got enough time and uhm then later on you know uhm if it would be possible I 'd like to you know render you with one number  \n\n\nBut before  but before that but before that uh I just wanna say one thing\n\n\nUhm you know when I entered show business in nineteen eighty-three there was no expectation of lasting this long in show business because excuse me because to be honest with you I never really used to sing\n\n\nWhen I used to sing uh in nineteen seventy-nine I used to sing over I mean  hindi pa uso ang  minus-one when I was in the States and it was a very traumatic experience for me when I lived one year in the States that I got to listen to the kind of music that I believe has molded my music today\n\n\nAnd I was singing over the voices uhm that was already recorded\n\n\nAnd so I 'd send it home to my sisters and my father and I 'd say hey listen to my tape \n\n\nAnd they couldn't hear my voice you know uhm obviously because I was singing I didn't have the technique and the style yet\n\n\nBut I came back in nineteen eighty you know and I entered De La Salle I mean I entered La Salle Greenhills  Kundirana  in eighty-two and still you know there was no expectation there was no dream of becoming a singer or a performer\n\n\nThere was no idea in my mind\n\n\nThere was no there was no uh uh picture of of Gary V performing on a stage like one that you 'd see in uh at the Ultra or at the Araneta Coliseum\n\n\nThere was none of that\n\n\nAnd I never used to play keyboards\n\n\nAs a matter of fact I still don't know what I play\n\n\nI just play\n\n\nAnd obviously this is not again  'no  this has not come out of my own doing because I don't practice every day\n\n\nI just you know when I when I dance it just comes out with the help of my choreographer from the Maneuvers who you all know\n\n\nAnd these things uh honestly I don't you know when I come out on stage I don't think okay I 'm gonna do this in this part I 'm gonna do this in that part\n\n\nIt it just happens\n\n\nAnd that 's why I cannot contain myself from sharing with you the reason and the secret of my success\n\n\nSo if there 's any question that any of you would like to ask you know I 'm I 'm open to any, \n\n\nDon't be shy\n\n\nIf there 's anyone who 's supposed to be shy it 's supposed to be me 'cause I really don't come up and talk like this\n\n\nNot often at least you know\n\n\nBut I 'm talking to uh fellow La Sallites and for me that 's the hardest crowd to uh relate to\n\n\nI don't know why but I always feel that way, \n\n\nOkay okay the question is did I did I ever have any formal voice lessons\n\n\nNo\n\n\nI never had any voice uhm uhm professional vocal training\n\n\nAll I remember was in the  Kundirana  we 'd rehearse from six to nine every night including exam week\n\n\nAnd I guess that gave us the not the not the the the technique or anything like that because I think each singer was able to develop his own\n\n\nBut because of that training every night from six to nine there were nights I 'd come home I wouldn't have a voice and my my father would be so alarmed what 's happening to you and all that but it helped later on you know\n\n\nNow I can really go days on end you know with hardly any rest and yet perform maybe not a hundred percent but I still have the voice here,  \n\n\nYes  \n\n\nI know you\n\n\nGo ahead,  \n\n\nI 'm sorry\n\n\nYou can go ahead you can use the mike  \n\n\nWhat made me turn to God\n\n\nActually, actually there was no intention to look up and to turn to God because there was no need to at that time so I thought\n\n\nThis all happened in nineteen eighty-five\n\n\nAnd in nineteen eighty-five some people consider it to be still my biggest hit  'no  uh  Di Na Natuto  came out\n\n\nThat song was played in the airwaves for more than seven months and was on the charts for more than six months\n\n\nAnd I felt because of all that I had gone through in life prior to this point I felt wow for the first time I did something on my own\n\n\nAnd really there was no you know it was like I looked up and I said yeah okay I know You 're there but hey I did this on my own so you know You can just leave me now I 'll be okay and if I need You I know You 're there for me \n\n\nIt was that kind of a god that I had pictured in my mind someone who I could just run to when I had problems\n\n\nI didn't realize that he was there from the very very beginning even through all the trials\n\n\nNow just to give you some trials that I 've gone through \n\n In nineteen seventy-nine like many of the kids today like many of all of you like many of you rather well some of you rather might have family problems and might have homes that are separated\n\n\nThat 's exactly what happened to me in seventy-nine\n\n\nIt was also in nineteen seventy-nine when I discovered that I had diabetes\n\n\nI came back and in nineteen eighty-one my house in Makati burned but that was a blessing in disguise 'cause I moved to San Juan and there was a piano there and I again would practice two hours every morning not knowing what I played you know just this sounds good and that sounds good", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThank you Owen that 's a funny name for a for a girl, \n\n\nI 'm not used to using the podium so I hope you don't mind if I just move this aside\n\n\nCan I sit down\n\n\nOkay uhm\n\n\nFirst and foremost I 'd like to thank uh the organizers of this activity\n\n\nIt 's an  alternative class program\n\n\nIt 's uh interesting to note that uh despite the fact that you have your classes you uh put put aside  'no  your regular academic uh requirements at least for an hour and a half in order to come up with discussions on issues that are not necessarily well academically  you know uh  uh what do you call it are not necessarily academic in nature\n\n\nI 've always believed that uh you should not let your academics interfere with your education\n\n\nIn other words uhm education is not limited to the four walls of your classroom\n\n\nI suppose many of you know this\n\n\nBut then we are in another classroom but this time we 'll be we will be discussing the First Quarter Storm as was requested by the organizers\n\n\nWhat is the First Quarter Storm\n\n\nDoes anybody have an idea\n\n\nIt happened some twenty-two years ago most of you were not born yet\n\n\nI was still in I wasn't even in elementary\n\n\nI 'm still young but I 'm not as young as you are\n\n\nSo so don't don't think that I belong to the the era of the First Quarter Storm  'no  \n\n\nNo I don't\n\n\nIf at all my only recollection of the First Quarter Storm is that we used to live in U P Village and that 's uh very lose to the U P Diliman campus\n\n\nAnd I was playing in our in our garden and all of a sudden I smelled tear gas\n\n\nAnd we all ran to the house  we were all crying at least we were four or five because of the tear gas and we were wondering what the hell that was\n\n\nOf course nobody told us that uh U P the U P Diliman campus was in fact invaded because of the Diliman commune anybody familiar with the Diliman commune\n\n\nWell the students decided to take over the university after a five centavo increase in uh in transport rates were hiked  'no  were raised uh were imposed by the government\n\n\nYou can imagine how volatile the situation was\n\n\nBut that was one part of the First Quarter Storm\n\n\nWhat is the First Quarter Storm\n\n\nWell twenty-two years ago at uh this time there were massive mobilization there were several mobilizations  'no  massive mobilizations of students and youth marching in the streets calling for radical reforms and changes in our country\n\n\nThat was around twenty-two years ago from January to around March wave after wave of student protests engulfed the entire country\n\n\nLeaders like Edgardo Jocson Nilo Tayag uhm Chito Santa Romana Ericson Baculinao uh student leaders were actually marching in the streets calling for reforms in the country\n\n\nThat was twenty-two years ago\n\n\nSome of you are probably asking what so what  'no  \n\n\nSo they were marching in the streets and uh that 's good or is it good\n\n\nWhy discuss the First Quarter Storm in the first place\n\n\nWhy are we here discussing it today after twenty-two years\n\n\nWell, you it will be a surprise to some of you perhaps many of you are also familiar with it and I suppose many will agree when I say that reforms are still very much necessary even up until today\n\n\nThe problems of poverty the problems of social inequality the problems of social unrest or the roots of social unrest which were actually the uh reasons for the mobilizations some twenty-two years ago they still exist today\n\n\nExcept that perhaps there are some uh qualitative changes in terms of population in terms of gravity of the problem or incidence of poverty\n\n\nBut the reason why students marched in the streets over two decades ago and the reasons for poverty and hunger and unemployment that that exists today are very much the same  'no  \n\n\n Naroroon pa rin  \n\n\n Naroon pa rin 'yung usapin ng kagutuman naroon pa rin ang usapin ng kawalan ng hanapbuhay  \n\n\n Ngunit 'yung  First Quarter Storm  ang namuno nu'n ang mga mag-aaral ang mga estudyante  \n\n\nI suppose none of you will debate with me when I say that our country is in a rut right\n\n\nI mean we have problems right grave problems\n\n\nPoverty incidence is seventy percent  \n\n\nWhat does poverty incidence mean\n\n\nWhat does that mean  'no  \n\n\nYou have to earn something like four thousand pesos uh uh monthly and you still belong to the poverty line\n\n\nAnd the minimum wage is way way below the poverty threshold\n\n\nIn other words the workers and the professionals at least as far as minimum wage is concerned will have to work two days in order to be able to feed an average family of six for one day\n\n\nBecause as far as NEDA is concerned I think the minimum wage is one hundred uh eighteen uhm right one hundred eighteen\n\n\nDuring my time five years ago it was only sixty-four  'no  \n\n\nBut then NEDA says that for an average family of six in order to provide for the basic the must basic of needs food shelter clothing he has the family must earn something like two hundred forty to two hundred sixty pesos a  uh a day\n\n\nSo that 's where we are now\n\n\nThe uh  per capita  income of uh the Philippines if you are to compare it to other countries in Asia ours is something like seven hundred dollars per capita\n\n\nHong Kong is something like eleven hundred dollars\n\n\nChina is something like uh no I I stand corrected uh\n\n\nTaiwan and uh Japan Japan is something like twenty-three thousand  per capita  \n\n\nSo you can imagine how 's how far behind we are\n\n\nUhm Indonesia is something like five hundred\n\n\nAnd uh Bangkok is something like eleven hundred,  'no  much higher than four hundred dollars higher than our  per capita  income\n\n\nAnd that 's already Malaysia Malaysia too  'no  around thirteen hundred\n\n\nWe are lagging far far behind\n\n\nIn nineteen sixty-two we were only second to Japan in terms of uh development\n\n\nToday we 're second to Bangladesh in terms of underdevelopment, \n\n\nMany of you are perhaps familiar with the power shortage at least in Mindanao we 've we read about it\n\n\nThe water shortage which we expect in uh the summer months\n\n\nThe power rates are being increased, \n\n\nThe incidence of violence is also a a a concern\n\n\nPerhaps some of you are familiar with C P Lopez who was a student here\n\n\nMaureen Hultman is another\n\n\nUhm Leny Villa\n\n\nThe incidence of violence and the victims of lawlessness and violence in our country\n\n\nOn a daily basis kidnapping has been has been uh is already syndicated\n\n\nEldon Maguan was shot dead simply because he couldn't back out his car\n\n\nAnd most of them if you will notice most of the victims are are from our ranks from the youth\n\n\nThere is still social unrest very much even in the countryside\n\n\nThe insurgency continues to take its heavy toll on our people Marag Valley for example\n\n\nThere are problems in our country\n\n\nThere are grave problems in our country and we are in the process of trying to I hope formulate solutions to these problems\n\n\nThe I M F World Bank continues to burden us with a foreign debt service uh agreement that allows for close to both local and foreign debt close to around forty percent of our national budget goes to debt service both local and foreign\n\n\nBut they say that the local debt ballooned because of the need to service our foreign debt\n\n\nSo forty percent of your one peso instead of buying food instead of buying medicines instead of buying the necessary needs the necessary the basic needs of our people we have to pay debt service\n\n\nTough luck for those who cannot afford medicines and they happen to be the majority in our country\n\n\nThe incidence of poverty when you say poverty incidence there are three factors  'no  indicators\n\n\nSeventy percent of the of our people live below the poverty line\n\n\nAnd there are three indicators of what the poverty line is\n\n\nOne you can only afford two square meals a day\n\n\nTwo if you get sick you cannot afford medicines\n\n\nAnd three two changes of clothing in a week  'no  \n\n\nThat uh  these are indicators of the poverty line and, more than half of our population find themselves in such a situation\n\n\nNot to mention of course the fact that many of our people the unemployment rate is so high I think the underemployment rate is something like thirty-five percent and the unemployment rate is somewhere between ten to fifteen percent\n\n\nIt 's no wonder why most of our people have to go abroad to find work there\n\n\nThey end up becoming prostitutes in Japan chambermaids in Singapore house domestic help in Malaysia and contract workers in Saudi Arabia\n\n\nI mean why is this\n\n\nThis is this happens because our economy is unable to provide for necessary employment and the decent wages\n\n\nAnd hence our people have to go abroad have to be separated from their families and have to be subjected to the most cruel and inhuman conditions in certain areas\n\n\nOf course to us the youth what the hell do we care\n\n\nFor studying we hope to get a good job especially D L S U if you are a graduate of D L S U it 's you know it 's like a ticket to I don't know where  a ticket to a a a good paying job in a multinational corporation\n\n\nWe are students we are reviewing we go through our daily work daily homework daily assignments\n\n\nBut the situation in the country is there too\n\n\nEnvironment I failed to mention the environment\n\n\nPerhaps some of us are familiar with the massive destruction of our forests\n\n\nIf we continue to log the way we 're logging today by the year two thousand virgin our virgin forest cover will be gone\n\n\nA friend of mine took a trip to Isabela Cagayan the Cagayan province in Isabela province rather\n\n\nFrom here Manila up to Isabela is something like eight hours\n\n\nAnd he counted the number of trucks that were covered with uh what do you call it  'yung  canvas  'yung  illegal logs, for eight hours\n\n\nHe counted just one day and that 's the average on a daily basis\n\n\nWho can give us a guess as to how many trucks\n\n\nHundred twenty\n\n\nHundred\n\n\nHe counted hundred eighty-seven trucks, \n\n\nThat 's on a daily basis\n\n\nThe movement which I had which was mentioned earlier National Movement of Young Legislators we are a an organization of city municipal and provincial uh elected officials who are all young who are to a certain degree idealistic  'no  \n\n\nIsabela our regional assembly in Isabela came up with a position for total log ban\n\n\nTwo days after they received candles telling them not to interfere in the logging that is being undertaken in their province\n\n\nIt was a death threat\n\n\nEach of them received uh a a candle\n\n\nI don't know how big the candle was but it was a candle\n\n\nBut the level of of destruction in our environment is so great that we might end up in an uninhabitable hell in the future\n\n\nThe present generation does not really benefit much or will not really be affected much because in fifteen twenty years they will not be here\n\n\nBut we will\n\n\nAnd we will be here inheriting whatever is left of the continuing destruction of our environment\n\n\nThe pollution in Metro Manila is two hundred percent more uh is higher than the acceptable world standards\n\n\nSo of course many of us go home in our air-conditioned cars\n\n\nWe 're not familiar with the pollution\n\n\nWhy don't you try it one day\n\n\n Buksan n'yo  \n\n\nAnd others of course who take the jeep would know this\n\n\nOnce you get to your house you clean your nose you know you think gosh where did all that black particles come from\n\n\nBut that 's pollution for you\n\n\nAnyway all these problems we encounter\n\n\nSome of us are perhaps more familiar to this  about these problems than others\n\n\nThe question is the First Quarter Storm was in fact a mobilization of students and youth in order to address societal ills the ills the problems of the country\n\n\nWho here would say that our country is is in a heavenly position\n\n\nI I suppose no one\n\n\nBut who here is willing to really act on the problems\n\n\nMany of us will say as students and I 'm a student too yeah right\n\n\nI 'm a student too I 'm just on leave  'no  but I have eighteen units more to go", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "03243e9d-3ac0-4308-98e4-b3d47ca4e574", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood afternoon to each one of you\n\n\nI 'm so pleased  for  this occasion that I would be able to share with you some significant findings which I gathered from my visits to different libraries and also from my study that I personally conducted regarding uh a topic which became my interest when I enrolled in neuropsychology under the P H D Counseling uhm program of D L S U\n\n\nNow this interest in brain research stayed with me until now so much so that I try to devour all those different sources of information that I can take hold of because we know that the brain is the most important\n\n\nPerhaps you would say the heart but the most important organ in a person as some doctors and different instruments will be able to sustain life if our heart stops to beat or if our lungs stop to function\n\n\nBut let the brain stop for a moment and we will be pronounced clinically dead\n\n\nNow teachers have been for several years looking for ways of improving instruction to accelerate learning to make  to make understanding among the students be as simple as what they want it to be\n\n\nSo much so that many researchers have focused on different correlates of academic achievement\n\n\nTo mention a few school-related student-related family-related what have you 's only to find out that still our state of education is at a deplorable state\n\n\nIn his own words Secretary former Secretary Onofre said there is a seemingly deteriorating quality of education and no amount of changes in the curriculum seem to be able to help improve this deplorable situation \n\n\nAnd so uh this triggered my curiosity\n\n\nSuppose we try to study something that is really directly related to learning and that is the brain\n\n\nThat 's the background of the study\n\n\nNow brain research actually started one hundred or more years ago\n\n\nHowever it is a relatively new phenomenon in the Philippines so much so that in nineteen ninety Carvajal a local educator said brain dominance technology is new in the Philippines but nonetheless teachers must be familiar with the research findings regarding the brain because the learning styles of students are dependent to some extent on the kind of processing that their brain does okay\n\n\nHowever the cost of inviting lecturers who would shed findings and programs anchored on brain research is very prohibitive\n\n\nGroups would give as much as okay they will give lectures but it would cost as much as twenty-five thousand for a group of twenty-five people to uh a staggering amount of two thousand pesos per participant\n\n\nAs a result only very few schools only the affluent ones are able to go through this training program\n\n\nActually in the Philippines the first school in Southeast Asia is one of the high schools in Quezon City\n\n\nExclusive school for boys they had this training on integrative learning which is anchored on brain research\n\n\nAnd they found out that students are able to learn much more easily than before\n\n\nHowever I have not known yet any other school that has gone through the same training program okay\n\n\nSo with this backdrop let me present my research, \n\n\nUhm perhaps a presentation of the structure of the brain at this point may appear off tangent but it is necessary for me to do so in order to situate my presentation okay\n\n\nNow the brain actually is a grayish pink uh object somewhat having the consistency of a porridge hmm and crumpled like a big walnut\n\n\nIt weighs not more than thirty pounds but it has a great capacity because that is what it is designed for\n\n\nHowever a little used brain just like little used muscles will deteriorate\n\n\nSo in spite of the size of the brain it has tremendous powers and it has it has to be tapped okay\n\n\nNow the most important part regarding the brain insofar as education is concerned will be the different functions that have something to do with learning, \n\n\nAnd so may I present to you two views of the brain\n\n\nOne view is called the  triune  brain and the other view views it from the viewpoint of a bicameral brain\n\n\nSo let 's start with the  triune  brain, \n\n\nThis is called the  triune  brain because it consists anatomically of three parts \n\n We have the neo-mammalian, the neo-mammalian or the new brain or the cortex\n\n\nThen we have the paleo-mammalian the one at the middle or the mid-brain \n\n And the reptilian brain or the old brain okay\n\n\nOf these three brains the most interesting perhaps to educators will be the neo-mammalian or the cortex because it is the seat of all learning\n\n\nIn fact it is the only part of the brain in human beings which differentiate man from animals\n\n\nEven the largest of primates the chimpanzees and the gorillas only have as much as less than one third of the neo-cortex that man has\n\n\nNow actually the paleo-mammalian is the brain that sends messages to the neo-cortex\n\n\nIt serves like a secretary so that it processes first what should be acted upon by neo-cortex and prioritize all incoming sensory stimuli\n\n\nThe reptilian brain is the old brain\n\n\nAnd this is the seat of all uh the basic drives of men hunger okay strong emotions\n\n\nSo that when it is electrically charged a person would scratch and bite like an animal\n\n\nThat is why perhaps it is not surprising why biting and scratching are common among the young children in the nursery school because perhaps the reptilian brain is still strong in them because of the lack of socialization that is needed to be able to tame these animalistic drives\n\n\nNow what is important with the triune brain is that, the neo-cortex if stimulated with new stimuli functions more effectively than not\n\n\nNow the bicameral view of the brain presents it in terms of consisting of two halves, \n\n\nViewed from the top it is divided into the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere\n\n\nActually this is part of the new brain or the cortex\n\n\nEven though they look symmetrically the same as if one is the exact image of the other they perform differently so their functions are asymmetrical\n\n\nHowever there is communication ongoing between the two halves of the brain so that one knows what is taking place in the other brain and this is made possible by means of a nerve tissue a big bundle of nerve tissues here consisting of more than two hundred million nerve cells\n\n\nThat makes communication between the two brains possible\n\n\nNow perhaps we would ask why is it that the two brains function differently and how come these differential functioning of the hemispheres of the brain are known\n\n\nSo may I trace very briefly the history of how brain dominance as it is called now or brain laterality  'no  has been discovered, \n\n\nOkay the first insight into the possibility that the brain consists of two different hemispheres each functioning differently uh was done by Broca Paul Broca a French scientist and surgeon who had a patient who lost his ability to talk or to speak because of an injury to the left brain okay\n\n\nWhen that patient died his brain was operated on and it was observed that there is a defect there has been the injury in one part of the left brain\n\n\nSo that made Broca think perhaps the left brain is the seat of language\n\n\nAnd another patient with the same problem died and they also found the same injury in the left brain\n\n\nHowever this cannot be verified by operating on live people\n\n\nAlthough the brain is not sensitive to pain it is the only organ perhaps aside from the nails and the hair that do not suffer does not suffer pain okay\n\n\nHowever uh in uhm in one university uh Spencer together with his associates tried to perform surgical severing of the brains the two hemispheres of the cortex among cats and then followed by monkeys\n\n\nAnd they found out through their experiments that the two hemispheres of the brain really function differently\n\n\nNow in nineteen  sixty-one okay uh Spencer was able really to perform this, kind of operation on a human being\n\n\nThe purpose is not actually for the pure sake of experimentation but because the patient is suffering from epilepsy\n\n\nAnd it was thought that to separate the left hemisphere from the right hemisphere through surgery will prevent the spread of epileptic seizures from one hemisphere to the other okay\n\n\nAnd there were others other patients with the same condition their brains have to be severed in terms of that hemispheric laterality in order that they could be saved or they could be cured with regard to their illness\n\n\nNow these patients now are literally called split-brained patients\n\n\nAnd the experiments that were done regarding these split-brained patients really confirmed what Broca had found earlier or had by  by intuition discovered earlier that the two hemispheres function differently\n\n\nNow what were the tasks that were done along this line, \n\n\nOne technique that uh was done by Sperry and his associates made use of special instrument called tachistoscope\n\n\nIn this procedure with the use of the instrument for a brief second of time a visual stimulus is presented to the patient to the split brain patient okay\n\n\nThe time has to be that controlled otherwise the left and the right eye will help each other understand what the object is\n\n\nThe study is such that the object is presented first to the right or perhaps to the left but it has to be presented only to one visual field of the patient\n\n\nNow the anatomy of the person is such that the left brain controls the other side of the body\n\n\nSo the left brain controls the right hand the right eye the right the right uh foot and so on and vice versa\n\n\nSo that whatever object is flashed to the right visual field of the patient will be projected to the left hemisphere\n\n\nAnd whatever is projected to the right visual field will be absorbed by the by the left hemisphere\n\n\nNow they found out that the visual stimulus that is presented to the right visual field which is projected to the left hemisphere could be named readily by the person\n\n\nThe person can tell the name of the object\n\n\nBut if that object is presented to the right visual field which is projected to the I mean to the left visual field which is projected to the right hemisphere the person cannot give the name of the object\n\n\nAnd this is true also for the other patients so they say then the language center must be in the left brain okay\n\n\nHowever if the object is given to the patient okay without looking at it together with other objects by feeling it with the left hand the person is able to say to uh to select what he sees in the picture from the objects given to him or to her\n\n\nSo that means that the left hand which is controlled by the right brain is able to understand visual uh relationships spatial relationships\n\n\nAnd so they say perhaps the center for visual analysis of relationships reside in the right brain, \n\n\nNow that kind of study can only be done for split-brained patients\n\n\nIt cannot be done for normal people because normal people still have the corpus callosum that connects the two brains and so they have to verify this among normal populations just to confirm the localization of functions of the brain\n\n\nFor this purpose they use what we call the E E G pattern analysis okay or the electro encephalogram pattern analysis by which uh certain mechanisms are attached into the scalp of the person\n\n\nThis is registered in the galvanometer pen and then it is printed in a piece of paper in the form of waves\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nAnd Revenson identified four different kinds of waves that could be picked up from the electric activity of the brain, \n\n\nThese are called the  alpha  wave the  beta  the  gamma  the  delta  and the  theta  \n\n\nThis will be of particular interest to educators because one of these waves if developed among the pupils will develop their ability to be creative and intuitive", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e3ea7ac2-cfb2-4180-a06c-862b93bea7e5", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood afternoon to everybody, my students and friends, \n\n\nUh allow me to use this microphone because I 'll be reading some notes and be going to the overhead projector to show you some slides, \n\n\nSo first of all I 'd like to uh correct that I am a doctor a specialist  'no  \n\n\nSo right now the highest educational attainment I got is uh an M S in Environmental Engineering and also a I 'm a  Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering graduate not a B S Chemistry graduate\n\n\nI 'd like to thank the organizer of this symposium uh which is  LIKAS  \n\n\nUh for those who are not familiar this is the  Lasalista para sa Pag-iingat ng Kalikasan  uh and I 'm very happy that uh they have organized the Ecology Week to make us aware of uh our role and our responsibility as protector of the environment\n\n\nSo I was asked to present a paper or a lecture about air pollution in the urban scene\n\n\nAnd fortunately when I was given notice about it in the the last week of October I was already preparing a paper for next week uh International Conference on Environmental Protection in Big ASEAN cities\n\n\nAnd uh  the paper that I will be presenting is a paper entitled Air Pollution Study in Metro Manila\n\n\nSo it was just very timely that I have the paper uh being prepared so I consented on giving this uh lecture to you\n\n\nSo some of the data and notes that I 'll be presenting next week will already be given to you in advance\n\n\nOkay, \n\n\nSo uhm, so the topic I prepared for you this afternoon is air pollution-related problems in the urban areas\n\n\nThere are a lot of pollution problems we 're experiencing right now but uh the one tasked of me to present to you is on air pollution because there are many forms of environmental degradation  'no  and one form is uh air pollution\n\n\nBut specifically we 'll be talking about air pollution in the urban scene\n\n\nUh there are so many problems that arise through air pollution like photochemical smog and right now we are experiencing global climatic changes the greenhouse effect which the adviser of ENGLICOM already mentioned okay and some other uh related problems will be discussed here \n\n And maybe at the end we can present some solutions and your suggestion will be highly appreciated later on because in next week 's uh international conference there will also be a workshop where maybe some of the suggestions that you will be handing on or recommending today will be incorporated\n\n\nOkay, \n\n\nNow what is air pollution and what are its effects\n\n\nFirst the National Pollution Control Commission now called the Environment Management Bureau under the Department of Environment and Natural Resources or D E N R defines air pollution as an undesirable change in the physical chemical and or biological characteristics of air which will adversely affect plants animals human beings and even inanimate materials\n\n\nNow what is air pollutant\n\n\nIt 's also called air contaminant and it is defined as any substance not normally present in air\n\n\nSo it 's not normally present in air\n\n\nThere are a lot of gases which we will show later normally present in air or it is also defined as these substances measured maybe present in normally in air but their concentration is greater than their normal concentration\n\n\nSo they 're also considered a pollutant okay\n\n\nLet us take for example carbon dioxide\n\n\nCarbon dioxide is normally present in air in a certain normal quantity but right now it has been shown from researches or findings and is already documented that carbon dioxide is increasing at a rate of uh about one to three percent a year\n\n\nAnd so therefore uh we are already experiencing global climate changes or global warming due to it\n\n\nSo we now consider it carbon dioxide as a pollutant because it is now present in the atmosphere greater than its normal concentration\n\n\nNow what are the normal substances present in air\n\n\nIf we look at table one on a dry basis the composition of clean air is shown\n\n\nIs that very clear\n\n\nBy expressed in percent by volume we have the second column and in terms of parts per million we have the third column\n\n\nSo these are the normal composition of clean air\n\n\nIt 's on a dry basis\n\n\nThirty percent of the weight of air is water vapor\n\n\nBut this is on a dry basis\n\n\nSo let 's take for example carbon dioxide\n\n\nIt is normally present at three hundred eighteen P P M\n\n\nBut if you exceed that right now it 's about three hundred seventy-five P P M okay it 's already above what is normally present then carbon dioxide in excess is already an air pollutant okay, \n\n\nThere are different classifications of air pollutants\n\n\nAnd later on you will find out that among these there are five major pollutants identified to be ever increasing in an urban area okay\n\n\nAnd these are carbon monoxide the hydrocarbons the nitrogen oxides the particular matter and sulfur dioxide\n\n\nBut table two will show you the different classifications of air pollutants\n\n\nSo air pollutant may be classified as inorganic gases organic gases and particulates\n\n\nUnder the inorganic gases we have the oxide of nitrogen okay and we have typical examples of this pollutant in air\n\n\nAlso under inorganic we have oxide of sulfur\n\n\nWe have sulfur dioxide sulfur trioxide oxide of carbon and other inorganics like hydrogen sulfide hydrogen chloride ammonia and chlorine are also considered to be inorganic gases that are uh considered as pollutants\n\n\nUnder the main classification of organic gas we have the different hydrocarbons\n\n\nOkay we have methane butane etcetera\n\n\nWe have the aldihydes and the other organics\n\n\nAnd last classification fall under particulate matter\n\n\nWe have solid particulates in air and we have also liquid particulates\n\n\nA best example of a solid particulate is lead\n\n\nThis is one of the related problem right now is the lead accumulation in air\n\n\nWe will be discussing that in detail later on\n\n\nThere 's also smoke which comes from the tailpipes of our cars considered to be solid particulates\n\n\nAnd then of course we have the liquid particulates like the acids suspended in air and of course mist spray etcetera\n\n\nSo among all these pollutants present in air, I mentioned five major uh pollutants that are of concern for us in the urban areas\n\n\nWe have sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide,  uh rather uh carbon monoxide hydrocarbons and particulate matter\n\n\nNow since these are ever increasing in the urban area what are its effect on us on animals plants and inanimate objects, \n\n\nCarbon monoxide is derived in urban areas from automobile\n\n\nTransportation may account to over ninety percent by weight of all carbon monoxide in the air in large cities especially if retail heavy industry is present\n\n\nSo we obtain or carbon monoxide in air comes from mostly or mainly from transportation okay\n\n\nCarbon monoxide has a bad effect on health\n\n\nIt passes through the lungs directly into the blood stream\n\n\nIt has a toxic effect caused by the affinity of the hemoglobin in the blood for C O molecule\n\n\nWhat 's the function of hemoglobin\n\n\nHemoglobin functions to carry oxygen from the lungs to the body tissue\n\n\nSo it provides the oxygen, to the from the lungs to the body tissue\n\n\nSince carbon monoxide combines with the hemoglobin strongly it prevents the carrying of oxygen to the tissues\n\n\nSo it is easy therefore to understand why in heavy traffic or congested traffic we experience headaches and dizziness okay especially if our cars are not air-conditioned okay\n\n\nMaybe some of you have air-conditioned cars you may not experience this kind of uh symptoms\n\n\nSulfur oxides are primarily sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide\n\n\nThey are derived mostly from stationary sources like power plants and industries by the burning of fossil fuels\n\n\nSulfur oxide in the atmosphere produce deleterious effect on vegetation materials and man\n\n\nLeaves of affected plants show  splotted  bleaching pattern\n\n\nSo the leaves of uh trees and plants changes color\n\n\nIt 's being bleached by the presence of sulfur dioxide in the air, \n\n\nAlso sulfur dioxide dissolves to form sulfuric sulfurous acid\n\n\nSulfur trioxide dissolves to form sulfuric acid\n\n\nYou are familiar with these strong acids\n\n\nThese suspended acids these are the liquid particulates they are suspended in air are washed down during the first rain when it rains they 're washed down\n\n\nSo what will happen\n\n\nIt causes damage okay damages to what\n\n\nTo properties like metals vegetation and textiles because nylon and other fabrics are easily attacked by these acids\n\n\nThese are called acid rains\n\n\nThat 's one of the related problem we will also be discussing at the end\n\n\nAcid rains can corrode metals attack nylon and other fabrics\n\n\nIt affects also plants\n\n\nEven limestone and marble are susceptible to acid attack\n\n\nSo don't say that uh marble or limestone cannot be corroded okay\n\n\nThey are  degraded okay because of the reaction of these material with acid rains\n\n\nSulfur dioxide acts an irritant and is known to increase symptoms of patients with bronchitis and other lung diseases\n\n\nHydrocarbons are mostly derived from incomplete combustion or partial oxidation of fuel in motor vehicle found in the urban areas\n\n\nSo if our engine like what Ms Chua mentioned in her introduction if we don't tune up our engine so uh oxidation in our engine of the or burning of fuel inside our engine becomes incomplete or partial\n\n\nSo if you burn C H C X H Y with oxygen some of C X H Y remain unreacted\n\n\nSo not not all are converted to C O two or C O plus water but some are unreacted C X H Y\n\n\nSo this is one of the source of uh hydrocarbon in air the incomplete combustion due to  maybe improper air to fuel ratio tuning or timing of our engine\n\n\nForest and vegetation also emit various hydrocarbon in their normal biological processes okay\n\n\nExample are bacterial decomposition of organic matter produces methane gas\n\n\nMan also allows hydrocarbon to enter the atmosphere by allowing industrial solvents to evaporate\n\n\nWhen you are you are putting on your gasoline in your gasoline tank  'no  some of the gasoline evaporates\n\n\nSo this contributes to air pollution\n\n\nAnd also the processing and usage of petroleum\n\n\nBecause of the wide variety of hydrocarbon emitted it is therefore difficult to generalize their  their effects on man\n\n\nHowever reactive hydrocarbon plays an important role in smog formation\n\n\nThis will also be discussed later on\n\n\nUh also certain hydrocarbon like benzoate pyrene has been linked to cause cancer, \n\n\nParticulates are complex acids and liquids found in our atmosphere\n\n\nThey are placed in the atmosphere by natural emissions like volcanic eruption or from man-made processes in industries like grinding and spraying fly ash from combustion processes and from automobile\n\n\nOf all the toxic metals found in air lead is present in the biggest concentration\n\n\nSo we will focus later on on related problem lead on problem of lead accumulation in the air\n\n\nNow lead comes from the burning of gasoline where it is added as anti-knock agent\n\n\nSo it is an additive in gasoline\n\n\nSo when you when they blend the gasoline they put it in the gasoline station they already have lead in it uh because they use it as an anti-knock agent\n\n\nThen oxide of nitrogen or nitrogen oxide generally referred to as N O X okay are generated mainly by automobile and the electric power plants\n\n\nThe most significant environmental effect of N O X emission is its role in smog formation, \n\n\nNitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide are known to cause fading in acetate cotton and rayon fibers\n\n\nYellowing of white fabrics has been shown to occur in the presence of nitrogen oxide\n\n\nNitric oxide is not an irritant and its main toxic potential results from its oxidation to N O two\n\n\nSo what is an irritant is N O Two not nitric oxide nitric oxide is N two O", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "fb49da70-7057-448f-a779-3a6d740abb94", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWell uh good morning everybody\n\n\nI also would like to thank you for the privilege to speak in here even though I was informed only yesterday\n\n\nI really enjoy talking to students about computers that 's why since uh I don't have any commitments at this time I readily accepted the the invitation\n\n\nI really enjoy talking to students\n\n\nWell as far as the career opportunities in computer science or computer application to be more specific is concerned well let 's answer first this question\n\n\nLet 's go first with the demand  'no  maybe you want to ask yourself okay I think uh I understand that you are freshmen and sophomores here\n\n\nSo maybe after two or three years will there be a job for me in the computer industry\n\n\nThe answer is a definite yes\n\n\nOkay as early as as late as nineteen eighty-one the demand for information technology people so I 'm using the word \" information technology \" to be more general\n\n\nI 'm not using the word \" computer science \"  'no  \n\n\nI 'm using the \" information technology \" because uh this is the term we use for people who are in the computer industry\n\n\nSo you 're not necessarily it 's not really required that you be a computer science graduate in order to be part of the computer industry\n\n\nAs long as you are working with computers you are part of that industry\n\n\nSo the demand for information technology specialists or people is placed at about thirty-five thousand  'no  \n\n\nThat was in nineteen ninety nineteen ninety-one\n\n\nAnd at that point it was estimated that less than forty percent of the companies here are computerized\n\n\nSo the demand is already thirty-five thousand and yet only forty percent of the of our entire industry is computerized\n\n\nSo if you try to place it wherein if uh we place the level of computerization to one hundred percent then probably if there 's a direct relationship between the two the demand would rise up to seventy to eighty thousand professionals\n\n\nNow is that number big or small\n\n\nYou might think eighty thousand  parang napakaliit  \n\n\nMaybe by the time I graduate  puno na 'yung  eighty thousand  na 'yun  \n\n\nOkay let 's again look at figures\n\n\nLet 's just look at La Salle probably just the College of Computer Studies because I don't know the exact population of the other programs with uh major in computer applications\n\n\nSo if you look at it the the College of Computer Studies can only produce about three hundred graduates a year\n\n\nSo try to see that with eighty thousand so three hundred out of eighty thousand I think you can compute already the percentage there\n\n\nAnd La Salle is already considered as one of the the biggest school in Computer Science\n\n\nMeaning to say our population  'yung  three hundred  na 'yon malaki na 'yon  \n\n\nAteneo we accept about uh four hundred freshmen a year Ateneo accepts only about one hundred\n\n\nU P about roughly the same figure\n\n\nSo if we combine all computer schools  'no  there are only a few uh universities and colleges offering computer-related programs probably we 're only producing uh about one thousand that would be an optimistic figure\n\n\nOne thousand information technology specialists a year\n\n\nSo just think thirty-five and then eighty thousand so definitely by the time you graduate maybe the demand for eighty thousand may not be even filled by twenty-five percent\n\n\nAnd maybe just perform an experiment just look at maybe on a Sunday maybe you buy a newspaper uh then look at the jobs required you will see there uh usually B S in whatever required the age so on and so forth pleasing personality\n\n\nAnd then at the end computer those with computer background will have an advantage\n\n\nOkay so definitely in terms of your question of the demand yes there is that tremendous demand and even up to now we cannot even fill it up\n\n\nAnd we cannot really expand there has been pressure for the College of Computer Studies to expand its population but with our limited uh campus size and facilities we cannot do that\n\n\nRight now there are about one thousand eight hundred students in our college and we cannot grow uh beyond that\n\n\nUnless that we find some other campus to build a new building\n\n\nSo your question about the demand yes you are needed\n\n\nNow the other question is if I 'm not a Computer Science graduate can I make it in the field of computers\n\n\nAgain the answer is yes\n\n\nOkay especially in your course uh it 's uh B S Math\n\n\nIf you choose B S Math with computer applications you also have an advantage\n\n\nI myself am not a Computer Science graduate okay \n\n\nI virtually don't know how to program when I finished my degree in E C E that was well they mentioned already the year that was in eighty-four\n\n\nI 'd like to say eighty-eight or something but uh since they mentioned it\n\n\nDuring that time when I was taking up my computer courses we had only a small machine a P D P Eight which right now I think you can buy a calculator that is much more powerful than that machine\n\n\nAnd it was considered  already during that time a mini-computer  'no  \n\n\nAnd they were only teaching us BASIC\n\n\nSo if you look at my knowledge when I graduate compared with the knowledge that you will have when you graduate I think you are in a better position than I was when I graduated way back in eighty-four\n\n\nAnd yet I was able to uh enter this particular field okay\n\n\nBecause uh  the the beauty about computers is that you don't need really a B S C S degree in order to succeed in it  'no  \n\n\nPeople have been studying computers ever since\n\n\nIn fact if you look at it the very first computer professionals were not even B S C S graduates because  wala pang  C S program\n\n\nLa Salle was the first one to offer a B S C S program and that was in nineteen eighty-one\n\n\nAnd computers were here as early as the sixties and the seventies\n\n\nSo don't have that apprehension that  hindi naman ako  Computer Science graduate I am basically a B S Math graduate therefore I cannot make it in the industry\n\n\nBut like I said you will have several units of computer subjects so you will be in a better position than most students who will be graduating with just a plain degree without any major uh as far as computers are concerned\n\n\nSo as far as that question  naman  is concerned yes you are needed by the industry\n\n\nSo don't worry about not being a C S graduate okay\n\n\nSo you have already the the only skill really needed okay in computer science is or computer applications or computer industry is logic formulation okay of which you will I think it will be taught to you in one of your programming subjects\n\n\nAnd uh I 've looked at your curriculum and uh I 've seen that most of the computer foundations are found in your curriculum\n\n\nThat means you will have that necessary background in order to enter the information technology field\n\n\nOf course I already suggested this last year when I gave the same talk uh\n\n\nIf you uh entering as a programmer will be no problem as far as you are concerned because you will be given the fundamental theories in programming\n\n\nBut being La Sallites I think you are worth more than just being programmers\n\n\nOkay the mere fact that you were chosen uh about we accepted about two hundred two thousand uh freshmen all colleges  'no  two thousand out of possibly ten to twelve thousand applicants\n\n\nThat means you are capable okay of being of being of doing more than just mere programming\n\n\nSo the the nice thing about this talk is that I 'm doing it now for freshmen and sophomores so at least you can prepare yourselves  'no  \n\n\nIf ever you do decide to take up this major okay I would suggest uhm if you want to raise the level of your computer uh literacy you can also take up some courses that are not offered in your curriculum okay\n\n\nOr you cannot you don't really have to go through a formal uh schooling as far as computers is concerned\n\n\nI myself never really enrolled formally in any uh school when I learned everything about computers okay\n\n\nI started my masteral degree in eighty-eight so between nineteen eighty-four and eighty-eight it 's just self-study\n\n\nSo you may want you may opt to do that or we have a a program here the IMPACT program\n\n\nIt 's an office wherein they 're offering short term courses\n\n\nSo for example if uh I I would suggest fields like systems analysis and design okay\n\n\nThat is a field that is that is again another area wherein we need a lot of people there\n\n\nSo you 're not really when you say systems analysis you 're not really programmers  'no  \n\n\nYou just study the system and then develop some sort of algorithms wherein you want to improve the system and then the programmers will just implement your suggestions\n\n\nWe need people like this so they have a good course there in systems analysis and design\n\n\nSo you may want to especially during your term break  'no  uh of course I 'm not suggesting that you be nerds that even your term break would be spent on studying\n\n\nBut if you have nothing better to do let 's say on a summer then maybe it 's worth your time if you want to spend okay a little time of your vacation in taking up courses like this\n\n\nAt least it will prepare you  'no  probably in your third or fourth year you may want to do that <indi> 'no  uh amidst maybe the difficulties of your thesis you may find some time in undergoing courses like this\n\n\nIt will be helpful definitely  'no  \n\n\nThe other area that you may want to go through would be uh familiarization with mainframes  'no  \n\n\nWe have a mainframe here the forty-three eighty-one\n\n\nAlthough if you look at the trend now in the industry mainframes are sort of like pass\u00e9  'no  uh\n\n\nEverybody is going into smaller machines let 's say four eighty-six machines and then just connecting them in a network as opposed to the expensive mainframes\n\n\nSo your question might be why should I study mainframes  'no  \n\n\nBut in the context of the Philippine computer industry majority of our the companies here are still using mainframes okay\n\n\nThey cannot just junk it and then replace them with newer machines because they already invested millions of pesos\n\n\nSo definitely in order for you to succeed in the Philippines as far as computer science is concerned then maybe a knowledge or a background in mainframe utilization would be helpful okay\n\n\nSo again IMPACT will have well I 'm not from IMPACT so don't think that I 'm commercializing them I 'm just like giving out suggestions  'no  \n\n\nAlthough maybe your organization Math Circle may come up with an arrangement with Computer Services Center wherein maybe they can come up with uh simple mainframe   familiarization seminars okay for you people somewhere in your third or fourth year okay\n\n\nBecause we have a mainframe here and of course you are free to use it as long as uh the utilization during that time is quite low\n\n\nAnd of course I would suggest if you have let 's say a personal computer at home then maximize its  its usage\n\n\nLearn computer packages like uh database\n\n\nI would suggest areas in spreadsheets and database management okay\n\n\nThere are a lot of programs that uh you can use in order to learn these concepts\n\n\nUsually these are not taught in school because well you don't really need a formal subject in order to teach uh how to use a certain computer package\n\n\nYou can study this on your own\n\n\nThere are a lot of textbooks\n\n\nNowadays you 're lucky\n\n\nTextbooks are available locally as far as using computer packages like  d-base four clipper fox base\n\n\nAll of these can be used easily don't be scared about the name \" fox base \" \n\n\nIt sounds like a zoo  'no  \n\n\nSo don't be afraid of the name\n\n\nThese are very easy to use\n\n\nAnd you have  we have already the literature\n\n\nEven in the library we have a good uh collection of computer science books\n\n\nAnd they 're not just for C S people they 're for everybody okay\n\n\nSo you may want to go to the library we have uh we spent we spent a lot of money acquiring these books\n\n\nSo for the meantime that 's what you can do in order to  prepare yourself for a career in the computer industry\n\n\nSo what are the possible jobs available\n\n\nSo you know already that there 's a demand\n\n\nSo what now can you do in the field of computers\n\n\nWell of course the the entry level okay that you may want to come into in a certain company would be a programmer\n\n\nBy the way when you see the word wanted data encoder do not apply, okay\n\n\nBecause you might think data encoder sounds complicated it 's like a nice career\n\n\nNo okay it 's not okay so let 's get that clear because some people would say okay for a computer uh a person who graduated with a degree relating related to computers the entry level would be a data encoder\n\n\nNo\n\n\nOkay the data encoder is just there to copy something and type it on a computer\n\n\nThat 's everything that you have to know about data encoding", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\n Magandang hapon din sa inyo\n\n\nAlam n'yo naman kaming mga pulitiko gusto namin ang ini-introduce kami\n\n\nTuwang-tuwa kami diyan\n\n\nPero mabuti na lang maikli ang introduction ni ano  \n\n\nLet me tell you however the story of the best introduction ever made of me anywhere in the world\n\n\nI was introduced by Gary Lising the comedian\n\n\nAnd this is how he introduced me in Rotary\n\n\nHe said ladies and gentlemen please I 'm very pleased to welcome the best congressman congressman  pa ako noon  the best congressman in the Philippines today\n\n\nHe is probably the best congressman in Asia and maybe he is the best congressman in the whole world \n\n\nAnd then he said someday he will be President of the Philippines probably President of Asia and maybe of the whole world  \n\n\nAnd then Gary Lising said ladies and gentlemen please welcome Congressman Bagatsing  \n\n\nSo  'nung tumindig po ako sabi ko naman sa kanila  on behalf of Congressman Bagatsing I regret to inform you that he cannot come today\n\n\nBut he asked me to give his best regards his highest esteem and admiration to the best comedian in the Philippines\n\n\nHe is probably the best comedian in Asia and maybe the whole world, Mr Joey de Leon   \n\n\nI want to thank you for the opportunity of explaining the issue on death penalty\n\n\nAnd talking of opportunities it reminds me of one of the Brothers of De La Salle\n\n\nYou know a long time ago I attended a conference in one of these big hotels and the theme of the conference was written in the wall and it said there are no problems there are only opportunities \n\n\nBut one of the De La Salle Brothers came down complaining and he was saying, he was saying to the reception girl I have a problem with my room\n\n\nAnd the girl pointed to the big sign there are no problems there are only opportunities \n\n\nAnd the Brother said I don't care what you call it but there is a woman in my room and I don't know whether it is a problem or an opportunity  \n\n\nAnyway about the death penalty, maybe towards the end of our discussion you should give me your feedback on what you think should be done about the death penalty\n\n\nThe discussion you see on death penalty is one of those debates where every side is correct\n\n\nIt is a debate where you can argue like in the middle ages where they were arguing how many angels can stand on the head of a pin\n\n\nIn this debate in my view everybody is correct\n\n\nIt becomes therefore a policy choice\n\n\nAnd that is where judgment and presumably wisdom is called for\n\n\nThe debate you may be familiar with is basically of two sides\n\n\nYou see we lawyers are very familiar with two sides because that 's what we do for a living presenting one side of case\n\n\nWe all know that there are always two sides to the question and the third side is probably correct\n\n\nAnd that is the determination of the judge\n\n\nBut in the policy debate on the death penalty the two dies are presented basically in this manner\n\n\nOne and this is supported by the Catholic Church argues that life is sacred\n\n\nAnd therefore there is nothing that can be done to take our you must not encourage the taking away of life\n\n\nWe must preserve life and protect life because it is unique\n\n\nIt is the best creation of the Lord and therefore there is no compelling reason for now to take away the life even of criminals\n\n\nThis is one position and it is correct it is correct\n\n\nThere is nothing more sacred than human life\n\n\nAll through eternity every single man and woman in this room was created uniquely\n\n\nThere will be nobody else fortunately or unfortunately like you\n\n\nAnd therefore whatever uniqueness you may have whatever qualities and combinations of talents you may have must be preserved and must be made to bloom\n\n\nThere seems to be no compelling reason to take away to snuff out that life\n\n\nAssume that there is a criminal\n\n\nAssume that the crime committed was heinous by whatever definition of the of the Constitution\n\n\nAssume it was something that was unconscionable\n\n\nIs there good reason to take away human life\n\n\nThe side that protects human life insists no because it does not deter\n\n\nThere is no reason you must always have hope that that human life will improve itself that that person will improve his spirituality and that person can still contribute something to the rest of humanity\n\n\nThe arguments of course in favor of death says it will deter it is a deterrent to crime\n\n\nIn other words right now with so many kidnappings with so much crime in the streets with so much killing even by men in uniform there is good reason to put the fear of the Lord into the hearts of criminals\n\n\nAnd therefore we must re-impose the death penalty, \n\n\nIn the Constitutional Commission when they were discussing this it was now Congressman Teodulo  uhm Natividad who argued for the protection of human life\n\n\nAnd he said that there is nothing even death does not deter crime\n\n\nAnd he used the example that has been written about in fact in several articles recently of the middle ages when hanging was the penalty for a crime of pickpockets\n\n\nIf you were a pickpocket and you got you got caught and you got convicted then you would be given hanging as the sentence\n\n\nYou would be hanged to death\n\n\nDuring the hangings however it attracted many many people because people like the gruesome people like the spectacle of seeing these persons hanging by the neck and uh moving about until they die\n\n\nAnd when there were people the pickpockets were very busy picking pockets  'no  \n\n\nAnd that was the argument he said\n\n\nYou see death was the penalty for the crime of picking pockets\n\n\nWhen the crime was being imposed the pickpockets were very busy\n\n\nAnd therefore the penalty of death did not deter the pickpockets\n\n\nThat argument in many different forms has been uh presented by different people, \n\n\nThe Senators who believe for instance in fighting uh or using all the resources of government to fight the drug menace insist however that the fear of death will deter\n\n\nAnd maybe uh that expectation can be reasonably based\n\n\nWe do see a lot of disrespect for law\n\n\nWe don't see fear of the enforcement of the law and therefore one can argue that if we make the penalty more stringent then the fear that can be instilled in the hearts of the people who are potential criminals may deter them from committing crime\n\n\nFundamentally that is the debate\n\n\nIn the Senate the report of the committee of Joey Lina and it was also reported out by the Committee on Justice which I chair recommended actually death penalty or  reclusion perpetua  as the penalty for various crimes\n\n\nYou may be familiar with why the Senate has to or why Congress has to come up with a recommendation on penalties for certain crimes\n\n\nThe Constitution abolished death penalty\n\n\nThe Philippine Constitution of nineteen eighty-seven removed death penalty from the statute books\n\n\nAnd in lieu thereof said something like  except when for compelling reasons Congress shall impose death penalty on heinous crimes  \n\n\nThe issue therefore became what are the heinous crimes\n\n\nAnd that is why the solution of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is to mention the following which shall be considered heinous crimes and therefore they should be subjected to capital punishment\n\n\nExcept that the definition of the committee on revision of laws of capital punishment only amounts to  reclusion perpetua  \n\n\nFor those among you who may have some uh nodding acquaintance with penal law  reclusion perpetua  means thirty years imprisonment\n\n\nThere are those who argue that that is a harder penalty and that should be a more fearsome penalty than death because death for whatever it is worth solves all your problems\n\n\nAccording to Rizal death at least gives you rest\n\n\nSo maybe death is the excuse uh for some people uh involuntarily terminating their human existence\n\n\nThe report of the committee recommends  reclusion perpetua  or, uh life imprisonment up to thirty years\n\n\nYou see there is really no life imprisonment\n\n\nEven in some instances you may remember having read the graft and corruption cases in the  Sandiganbayan  and they convict uhm only the small ones\n\n\nThis guy stole  seventeen thousand twelve thousand four thousand from the public works\n\n\nSo he was convicted with nine hundred years imprisonment because there was three years for seventeen thousand ten years for so many so he had all of nine hundred years on the theory that it 's the first one hundred years that is difficult\n\n\nSo nine hundred years but never they never really impose or they never serve nine hundred years\n\n\nThere is in the first place the physical limitation of being unable to last for nine hundred years\n\n\nBut all these long and lengthy sentences only amount really to thirty years imprisonment\n\n\nThe Lina Report says it is thirty years non-commutable and cannot be shortened\n\n\nAnd that is the option that the Lina committee is recommending\n\n\nThe Herrera position however and this is shared by many in the Senate suggests that we should impose death especially for drug pushers, especially for those who commit the heinous crimes of rape with murder and and  fourteen other crimes that are enumerated\n\n\nIn the House of Representatives they have enumerated eighteen crimes that can be subjected to death as a penalty\n\n\nThe tragedy there is that in the original penal law there were only twelve crimes subjected to death penalty\n\n\nNow we are going overboard\n\n\nWe are going to the other extreme and we want to impose death practically even on traffic violations\n\n\nAnd that is wrong\n\n\nDuring the time of the late lamented President Marcos there was a time he raised all the penalties to death, \n\n\nHe issued varying degrees in fact uh decrees in the these were the decrees that we brought to the Supreme Court and we questioned whether they could be issued even by the lawmaker who had no limits to his power\n\n\nWe argued that lawmaking has limitations of reason\n\n\nLawmaking has limitations built on nature uh on the law of nature\n\n\nBut he issued decrees like eighteen thirty-six and eighteen thirty-seven\n\n\nAnd one of these decrees increased all the penalties of crimes against public order to death\n\n\nAnd what were these crimes\n\n\nNever mind the great disorder  uh uhm demonstrations  etcetera  \n\n\nBut one of the crimes was if you were singing at night in a disorderly fashion that is a crime against public order\n\n\nThat is what they called \" charivari \" \n\n\nAnd under the decrees of Marcos charivari would have been subjected to death,  'no  \n\n\nI mentioned that because some of you may be fond of singing at night  on the belief that you know how to sing\n\n\nAnd you should appreciate then how fortunate you are that you live under these conditions when the Presidential decrees no longer apply\n\n\nNow those are the two extremes of the debate\n\n\nIn the House of Representatives I voted against the imposition of the death penalty precisely because of the belief in human rights and in the value of human life\n\n\nOnce though in La Salle Greenhills there was a conference of eight hundred street children\n\n\nThese were aged twelve to sixteen street children from Cubao street children from Quezon City\n\n\nThe street children you see is one of the sorriest episodes in the life of the Filipino\n\n\nYou see the young by nature are protected by their parents or by their ascendants\n\n\nThe young have always been protected even the puppies are protected by the bitch\n\n\nThere there is no other word for it\n\n\nThe kittens are protected by the cats\n\n\nThe birds the the chicks of the birds they are protected by their mother bird\n\n\nI don't know what you call them  'no  but the young\n\n\nBut in the Philippines today in Cubao alone there are three hundred thousand homeless children\n\n\nTheir parents are not protecting them\n\n\nIf you ever are in the Circle Theater near the Circle Theater there is a pizza parlor in one of the corners if you eat in the pizza parlor and you look at the tunnel through which the uh water passes you will see at night probably forty kids age twelve maybe lower sleeping in that small tunnel\n\n\nAnd it is what they call their home\n\n\nIt is therefore against almost uh the law of nature that we have homeless who are so young and have made the street have appropriated the street as their home\n\n\nWhat was the, plea of the children\n\n\nIn that conference in La Salle Greenhills they broke up the eight hundred or so children into I think ten workshops\n\n\nAnd they invited uh five Congressmen in the generic sense there were two Congressmen and three Senators invited to listen to their reports\n\n\nAnd every single workshop requested for one thing among others they also asked for schools they asked for homes  etcetera  \n\n\nBut there was unanimity in the request of one\n\n\nThey said could you please impose the death penalty on men in uniform who use us",

{"text": "<$A> \n\n\nGood afternoon\n\n\nUh thank you for being here\n\n\nUh yeah as Loy said the title of my sharing is \" Motivational Touches in the English Classroom \" \n\n\nUhm first I 'd just like to make some definitions and one disclaimer okay\n\n\nUh one for motivation uhm by \" motivation \" I mean uhm uhm uh the engagement of students in uh in the tasks  'no  that are set before them in the classroom, \n\n\nUhm I read this book unfortunately I cannot remember the title uh and the author\n\n\nIt 's uh it 's uh it 's one of these American uhm recipe source book things also\n\n\nUhm uh the the writers there said that uh if you have at least ninety percent of your students uhm engaged in whatever you assign them to do that means your your class is motivated  'no  \n\n\nSo it seems like that the bottom line for motivation if you see that they 're working\n\n\nThat 's it\n\n\nUhm if they 're excited about what they 're doing then that 's the icing on the cake okay\n\n\nUhm now of course motivation can be achieved in many ways no you can get human beings to do to do what you want them to do through many through a whole range of of tactics  'no  from torture to pleading\n\n\nIt 's not like it 's not you know uh I kind of course I go in somewhere in the middle ground  'no  \n\n\nUhm I can't do this\n\n\nThere are people there are I have had teachers who could get us who could motivate us by being strict  'no  the the authoritarian way\n\n\nUhm and I 've had teachers who could motivate us by you know the martyr thing  sige na naman  you know pleading\n\n\nUhm I 'm not comfortable with either\n\n\nUh the authoritarian way is very alien to my personality\n\n\nIt I find it tiring so I I rarely get angry because it exhausts me more than it does the students\n\n\nAnd I don't like to plead because that 's demeaning for a teacher\n\n\nUh I tend to go it 's somewhere the middle ground and the middle ground I choose uhm tends to be on the playful side\n\n\nUhm I don't really know why\n\n\nIt 's just that I I 'm happier playing than I am working so I guess I bring the play into my work\n\n\nUhm so the  the the some of the  activities I 'll share with you today uh are generally of the playful sort\n\n\nUhm they I 've most of these the the regular connected to to uh classifications  'no  regular activities and special activities\n\n\nThe regular ones I 've tried I think I 've tried these all here in my class uh in my classes here\n\n\nSo and they 've worked  'no  \n\n\nUhm and then the special ones uh those were developed for really special circumstances\n\n\nUhm the there was something I really wanted to achieve that was big and you know I had to do something big\n\n\nUhm I call these \" touches \" rather than strategies or you know something big like that\n\n\nThey 're just touches because they 're uhm, they don't have to be part of a whole uh pedagogical schema  'no  to to in order to work\n\n\nThey can they 're they 're rather self-contained and uh they can be inserted anywhere within even the  uhm so-called traditional type of lesson\n\n\nThey can be inserted you know to to break the routine you know or you know you 're just you 're just too tired of doing the same thing you wanna try something different\n\n\nThey 're self-contained enough to do that\n\n\nAnd uh they can be used uhm either as uhm appetizers for a coming lesson or they can be used as enrichment\n\n\nSo either way or they can be also the main lesson itself\n\n\nDepends on how you process them\n\n\nUhm alright I 'll go into the regular touches first\n\n\nUhm each of these uhm are enough for one La Salle class period  'no  one hour or one and a half hours  'no  \n\n\nUhm they 're meant uh some of them I have used really as uh as an entire lesson\n\n\nSome of them I I used as a uh  e  to introduce some grammar point or whatever\n\n\nThe first one I 'd like to share is the sentence auction\n\n\nI think I have the, uhm the sentence auction is an activity I got from uh Mario Rinvolucri 's uh \" Grammar Games \" \n\n\nIt was published nineteen eighty-four\n\n\nUh this is this is good uh for teaching uh sentence construction uhm for uhm revising erroneous sentences\n\n\nAs you can see on the sheet the uhm the sentence auction game the main uh material I mean uh for the sentence auction game is the auction sheet, where you have a list of sentences uhm some of them correct but most of them with some kind of error uh could be punctuation spelling grammar uh whatever, syntax\n\n\nAnd then if you see on the right side we have uh a series of blanks under \" budget \" and a series of blanks under \" bought \" \n\n\nThe idea here is uhm uh you give a copy of the auction sheet to the students\n\n\nUh what I did was I gave them about ten minutes I think to go over the sentences\n\n\nUh we did one to fifteen for one class period\n\n\nThat 's as far as we could get so I let them do one to fifteen\n\n\nUhm they have to decide which sentences are right and which sentences \nare wrong\n\n\nIn the auction they are supposed to bid for the sentences that they think are correct\n\n\nI gave them a budget fifteen thousand pesos for this okay\n\n\nSo that 's like one thousand pesos per sentence okay\n\n\nSo they they so under the budget uh budget uhm column they have to indicate uhm how much they would be willing to spend for whatever sentences they think they wanna buy  'no  \n\n\nHow high are they gonna go in the bidding\n\n\nThis this is so that they can control their budget  'no  \n\n\nAnd then later when the when the bidding has has uh uhm commenced uhm well those who who uh who managed to you know the highest bidders uhm can indicate on the \" bought \" blank uh how much they actually spent for the sentence  'no  \n\n\nNow I play the role of the auctioneer\n\n\nThis has to be done very fast because you have to generate the you know the auction excitement okay\n\n\nSo uh after the ten minutes are up  'no  uhm I tell them okay you 're you 've already got\n\n\nUh I did this uh I did this uh or rather I I let them work in pairs by the way  'no  I let them work in pairs so they could you know some discussion going on\n\n\nUhm and I  I asked the pairs to uhm write a number  'no  different number  'no  for each of them on uh like one fourth sheet of paper big enough for me to see\n\n\nBecause when they start bidding and you know I have to know which pair bought which they have to raise their number\n\n\nSo it 's just the numbers I write  \n\n\nSo when the bidding starts okay I could go something like uhm, uh alright uhm auction has started item up for auction now is the sentence number one \n\n\n\" I wanted that you should know what happened \"  \n\n\nDo I hear five hundred pesos for this auction for this sentence\n\n\nDo I hear five hundred  sentence is a genuine antique\n\n\nUhm it was uh last used by Louis the fourteenth every word made of solid gold\n\n\n Do I hear five hundred five hundred\n\n\nDo I hear five hundred and then there 's five hundred fifty over here\n\n\nFive hundred\n\n\nDo I hear six hundred six hundred six hundred\n\n\nDo I six hundred over here\n\n\nDo I hear seven hundred seven hundred seven seven hundred over here\n\n\nDo I hear a thousand a thousand a thousand and there is one thousand\n\n\nDo I hear one thousand five hundred one thousand five hundred\n\n\nNobody says one thousand alright going one one thousand\n\n\nGoing once going twice and sold for one thousand pesos to pair number eight \n\n\nAnd then I write it down here okay\n\n\nSo sentence number one bought to sold to pair number eight one thousand pesos  'no   \n\n\nIt 's tiring  \n\n\nAnd then right after that I go to\n\n\nAlright next item on auction sentence number two\n\n\n\" What happen to your sister last night \"  \n\n\nEvery word made of jade Ming dynasty and so on and so forth\n\n\nSo I go on until all the  the fifteen sentences have been bought  'no  \n\n\nUh for the sentences that were not bought I just put an X because I have all the numbers on the board one to fifteen  'no  \n\n\nIt 's if nobody wanted it so it 's X  'no  \n\n\nAnd this is really fun because you know this you know after a while I didn't even have to go into the Ming dynasty and Louis the fourteenth bit because it was really going fast  'no  because the biddings were coming up you know\n\n\nThere was even one group that uhm that splurged fourteen thousand pesos on one sentence and it turned out to be wrong <O> laughter <O> \n\n\nIt it was fun  'no  \n\n\nSo this went on the the auctioning I think went for uhm thirty minutes uh thereabouts so thirty minutes\n\n\nAfter after we went through the fifteen sentences I told them okay I 'll let you know now which sentences are correct\n\n\nAnd I just told them which number  'no  \n\n\nFor the fifteen I think there 's only one that 's correct\n\n\nUhm, uh \" What killed whom and when \" \n\n\nThat 's number three I think that was all that was right if I remember right  'no  \n\n\nSo I just told them okay then everything else is wrong\n\n\nAnd so of course there 's a lot of you know waaahh you know you know I spent too much and so on\n\n\nAnd then uh but I don't tell them what 's wrong with the other sentences\n\n\nI told them okay go over the sentences the wrong sentences that you bought and then try to figure out what was the error in those sentences and then correct them\n\n\nSo that was their seatwork  'no  \n\n\nSo each pair yeah after the auction so each pair uh wrote in the corrections to the the the incorrect sentences that they had bought  'no  \n\n\nThe others that they didn't buy it 's okay you you don't have to touch that\n\n\nUhm I gave them seatwork points for this you know\n\n\nUh if you bought only the one correct sentence uh if you budgeted only like I looked at their budget list if you budgeted only for the one correct sentence you have five seatwork points\n\n\nUhm and then you know if there 's a corresponding graduated you know\n\n\nYou get four seatwork points if you bought that one correct sentence but you have like two or three incorrect along with it  'no  and so on\n\n\nSo I just  freshmen uh uhm freshmen  \n\n\nSometimes well, uh  it would depend on what you mean by disciplinary 'cause this one is really meant to be noisy\n\n\nThey 're meant to shout\n\n\nThey 're meant to get excited\n\n\nAnd so of course they were shouting\n\n\nAnd I had to shout over their, it 's under control because they were focused  'no  they 're focused on this\n\n\nAs in my God were they ever focused you know\n\n\nIt was really you know it the the the objective really of this is to get them practically jumping on their seats  'no  with with you know the desire to buy this sentence\n\n\nAnd oh it worked  'no  and then afterwards then you know when everything is quiet and they have to do the the you know the correction and all that and then afterwards we process  'no  why is it correct\n\n\nUh the  this was uh the the following session uh that 's when we  ano  uh I mean we don't have enough\n\n\nWe have enough for the auction and the seatwork\n\n\nUh that would take you about an hour\n\n\nAnd then the following grammar time we went through the sentences okay\n\n\nSo I tried this out\n\n\nActually I had thirty but uhm uh I found that uh one session is enough", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "888550a5-150d-4d04-8b10-e8637addaa2f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.223756+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nOkay so today we will perform qualitative analysis  of elements  \n\n\nFrom the title of the experiment you can already predict what sort\nof tests we will carry out for today\n\n\nSo basically we would like to check what elements are present in the\ngiven substance in the sample solution\n\n\nOkay since we are talking about organic compounds so expect that\nthese compounds contain the element carbon and of course hydrogen\n\n\nBut also remember that organic molecules sometimes  \ncontains uh contain nitrogen sometimes oxygen sometimes the halogens okay\n\n\nSo we would like to check whether they are present or not\n\n\nSo what you will be given is a sample solution containing all those\nelements okay\n\n\nSo you are given a sample solution containing all those  \nelements and then you will test them for the different elements so naturally\nyou will always get positive results\n\n\nSo for example if you test the substance for nitrogen you can carry\nout that particular test observe see what happens in the reaction okay and be\nhow do you call this uh pay particular attention with regards to the\nformation of precipitates whether there is a change in the color of solution\nor not whether there are bubbles that form in the reaction and so on and so\nforth\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nSo when you test for nitrogen and knowing that your sample solution\ncontains nitrogen then those are the positive results\n\n\nLater on you will be given an unknown solution and that unknown\nsolution may contain maybe three maybe four maybe five elements we don't know\nokay\n\n\nSo based on your sample solution containing all the elements you\nwill base the results for the unknown solution\n\n\nIs that clear\n\n\nSo you have a  sample solution uh containing all those\nelements and an unknown you don't know what uh it contains\n\n\nNow you have read the procedure any question about that\n\n\nSo we will basically just mix uh chemicals reagents and observe\nwhat happens afterwards\n\n\nAt the end of the experiment I do not expect you to immediately\ncome up with a chemical equation to explain what happened in the test okay\n\n\nYou have to do some uh literature search to find out what\nparticular reaction took place uh in a certain test okay\n\n\nSo that will be for next meeting but for day for today I will just\nask you to come up with the different observations for each test okay\n\n\nSome techniques that you should know\n\n\nIf you are asked to test for acidity of the solution for example we\nwill use a litmus paper for that and you must observe the proper technique in\ndoing so\n\n\nYou do not put the litmus paper inside the test tube for example\nyou don't do that\n\n\nWhat you need to do is to dip the stirring rod in the solution and\ntouch the litmus paper and see whether there is a color change again\n\n\nIf there is a change in the color of the litmus paper from red to\nblue for example and that the blue litmus paper remains blue then it means\nthat you have a basic solution\n\n\nIf for example your red litmus paper becomes how do you call this\nwhich one okay and then the red remains red then you have an acidic solution\n\n\nOkay now if you will look at our solvents and reagents given here\neach bottle have its own  has its own dropper okay\n\n\nDo not interchange the droppers otherwise some of the reagents will\nreact with one another and it will be contaminated and uh you will always get\nwrong results okay\n\n\nSo be careful about that\n\n\nWhat else\n\n\nBe careful with the sodium metal why, sodium metal\n\n\nSo extra care in handling sodium metal because it reacts violently\nwith water in other words don't  don't try to touch it because\nagain your your your hands have moisture and that uh it violently reacts with\nit so be careful with the sodium metal\n\n\nOkay any question\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nClarification about the procedure\n\n\n Walang katanungan ( chuckles) wala, meron bang hindi\nnaintindihan malabo sa nabasa nyong  procedure  wala  \n\n\nOkay you may start doing the experiment  \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n Slimmers World International at\nMegamall S M

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWe start another week here on \" In Fitness and In\nHealth \" \n\n\nI hope you enjoyed last week when we had Paulo Villaruel and Cheska\nLaurel teaching us those Pilates exercises\n\n\nFor this week we 're back here to the house doing practical\nexercises that you can do with just minimal equipment\n\n\nSo for today let 's do some legs\n\n\nIf last week it was all about abs and lower back so let 's\nconcentrate on the legs and the arms for this week\n\n\nAll you need is a chair so that you can hang on for balance and we 'll\nstart with some lunges\n\n\nOkay take your legs apart like this make sure it 's wide\n\n\nOkay keep your body nice and erect but <unclear> 2 words </unclear> \nlean forward a little bit and then you come straight down\n\n\nOkay we 've done this before so you know that your knees should not\ngo past your toes\n\n\nThis is what I mean\n\n\nThis is what we don't want you to do so you don't hurt your knees\n\n\nSo take it straight down and then bring it up okay\n\n\nTake it down and all the way up\n\n\nNow the muscles that are being worked are the muscles of the\nbuttocks and the thighs and it is this leg right here right now that is doing\nthe work\n\n\nThe other leg is just following so when you come down it 's just\nbending also\n\n\nAnd again down lift up\n\n\nOkay let 's just do two more two more\n\n\nOne last, like that\n\n\nNow before we go to the other side we are going to do an exercise\nright here for the buttocks\n\n\nSo you lean forward here okay and you 're just going to bring it\nback like this\n\n\nSo not only the buttocks working but also the back of your thigh\nthe hamstrings\n\n\nVery small lifts\n\n\nLook at my back it 's not moving and yours shouldn't be moving also\n\n\nSo here 's the wrong way you don't want to do this\n\n\nKeep this steady here and just lift behind\n\n\nNow the leg in front is also doing some work you can feel that in\nyour muscles\n\n\nAlright let 's do two more oh and the last\n\n\nOkay put that down\n\n\nJust rest for a few seconds and now let 's do the other side\n\n\nOkay start with that lunge get into a good position\n\n\nIf you start here which is very very short here you 'll end up\ndoing that and that 's what 's gonna hurt your knee so take your leg back\nnicely\n\n\nMake sure it 's wide okay\n\n\nRemember your back is nice and tall put your knee slightly forward\nand come straight down\n\n\nNow if you want to develop some good balance you can let go of the\nchair and you can just do this\n\n\nOtherwise if you feel like you 're moving around then just put the\nhand lightly it can be a chair it can be the wall it can even be a desk\n\n\nOkay down inhale exhale as you come up\n\n\nDown and exhale up\n\n\nThat 's when you feel the exertion as you come up\n\n\nDo it again\n\n\nAnd here 's the last\n\n\nGreat\n\n\nNow move slightly forward here put all your weight in that leg and\nnow the buttocks and the hamstrings behind\n\n\nHere we go and lift\n\n\nJust a small lift\n\n\nKeep your mind involved in your exercise\n\n\nSqueeze the buttocks even before you lift the leg\n\n\nAgain if you want some balance you wanna challenge your balance do\nit this way\n\n\nSo you can have your arms here\n\n\nOtherwise just hold lightly squeeze remember lower back not moving\nthis is not a very high lift squeeze that\n\n\nYou should be able to feel this 'cause I 'm feeling it\n\n\nAnd one more one more\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nSo our legs have gotten a good work-out this morning\n\n\nWe did the lunges and we also did what 's called a leg lift\nextension to the back for the buttocks and the hamstrings and tomorrow we 're\ngonna give you exercises for the arms\n\n \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nHope you enjoyed yesterday 's exercises which were all about\nthe legs remember the lunges and that back lift extension but this morning we 're\ngoing to shift our focus now to the upper body and specifically we 're gonna\nbe working out on the chest and also the muscle back here which is called the\ntriceps\n\n\nNow if you 're using dumbbells at home what I want you to try is to\ntry two dumbbells in each hand for the chest because the chest is a much\nlarger muscle\n\n\nAnd then use only one dumbbell for the triceps\n\n\nIf you 're using water bottles which you filled up with sand my\nsuggestion is the sand does not weigh as much as putting in things like nails\nor ball bearings which you can buy in the hardware\n\n\nSo have several sets of those water bottles some of them with sand\nso that they will be like the one dumbbell and then some of them with the\nball bearings or the nails that will be the equivalent of two dumbbells okay\n\n\nSo let 's lie down on our mats now I 'm gonna try it with two\ndumbbells\n\n\nDon't be afraid ladies that you 're going to get your muscles very\nbig because this is only eight pounds on each hand and your chest actually\ncan take quite a bit of weight\n\n\nOkay slowly down now make sure that if you 're holding the two\ndumbbells you 're holding it well so it doesn't fall on your face\n\n\nTake it right above your shoulder joint\n\n\nAlright now and slowly we 're coming down and then we 're exhaling\nas we bring it up\n\n\nSo inhaling down move nice and slow like this and then squeeze it\nup\n\n\nThe reason I 'm moving slow is so that I 'm giving my muscles a\nreal challenge here because we 're actually only going to be doing eight\nrepetitions\n\n\nThat 's the fourth and I can really feel this one\n\n\nNot only am I moving slowly but I 've also got the right weight for\nmy chest\n\n\nOkay so remember larger muscles require more weight smaller muscles\nsmaller weight\n\n\nAlright here comes one this is the last one here exhale up\n\n\nOkay let 's do just one more for good measure\n\n\nDown and exhale up\n\n\nOh boy it 's really feeling that\n\n\nAlright now you 're going to use just one dumbbell\n\n\nSo get that dumbbell hold it up here bend the elbow bring it back\n\n\nI 'm going to put my hand here so I hold my arm steady so it\ndoesn't move and could only move from this portion\n\n\nAnd you take it straight up\n\n\nOkay where you put your hand you can actually feel your triceps\nsqueezing and contracting\n\n\nSo bring it up you want to straighten the arm but let 's take good\ncare not to over-straighten and lock it\n\n\nLike this\n\n\nYeah that 's the one you don't wanna do that 's painful on the\njoints\n\n\nYou want to keep the effort on the muscles and keep your joint safe\n\n\nOh I can feel this one and even if this is just four pounds because\nwe 're doing it slow holding it in the right position we 're really giving\nthat muscle a challenge\n\n\nOne more\n\n\nOh and that way\n\n\nNow let 's go to the other side\n\n\nTake it up again remember position it so that the elbow is facing\nthe ceiling hold it and then straighten\n\n\nNow think about your muscle imagine that it is a sponge and every\ntime you contract you squeeze the water out\n\n\nThat way you 'll be able to get the full contraction and the full\nbenefit also\n\n\nYou don't have to do so many repetitions but you do have to do\nquality repetition\n\n\nOkay again exhaling always on the exertion and squeeze it\n\n\nOkay one last to go and <unclear> word </unclear> excellent\n\n\nOkay let 's put that down\n\n\nNow to come up safely from here turn to your side use your hand and\nslowly up\n\n\nAlright so what have we learned today\n\n\nWe 've learned today that when you 're trying to work a large\nmuscle like the chest which covers this whole area here you need to have a\nheavier weight\n\n\nAnd then when you use the smaller muscle like the one back here a\nsmaller weight\n\n\nSo you can't have just one weight for both of those muscles  \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nGood morning welcome to an \" In Fitness and in Health\n\n\" morning\n\n\n\n\nI 'm Tina Juan and our guest for this week is Christine\nJacobs-Sandejas\n\n\nOh yeah Christine is beginning

recipes are uh easy to do they 're inexpensive the ingredients are\neasy to find but most of all all they 're delicious\n\n\nThese are confidence-building recipes  at saka  recipe\nideas for the experienced cook\n\n\nSo don't go away I 'll be right back\n\n\n Ngayong umaga dito sa ating  Magnolia Cheezee cooking\nportion  gagawa ho tayo ng isang  tenderloin steak with\nCheezee sauce tenderloin steak with Cheezee sauce\n\n\n Alam niyo ang gagawin natin dito  we 're going to use\nbeef tenderloin or  kung gusto ninyo  you may use a pork\ntenderloin also or  yung  chicken breast  'no  \n\n\nOkay so take this recipe down  napakalinamnam ho nitong\nreciping 'to  \n\n\n Gagamit ho tayo ng  Cheezee sauce  ng  \nMagnolia\n\n\nVery first ingredient for our recipe this morning is we have four\npieces of pork tenderloin actually pork  yung ginamit natin dito pero\npwede kayong gumamit pala ng  beef okay four pieces of pork\ntenderloin steak or any kind of steak any cut of steak\n\n\n Eto tingnan mo ang ganda nitong  pork tenderloin\n\n na 'to ang laki o  \n\n\nOkay and then we have one teaspoon of salt one teaspoon of salt\n\n\nOne teaspoon of pepper one teaspoon of pepper\n\n\nWe have some uh two tablespoons of Magnolia Gold butter two\ntablespoons of Magnolia  Gold butter\n\n\nAnd two tablespoons of uh olive oil two tablespoons of olive oil\n\n\nWe then have one-fourth cup of Magnolia Gold butter one-fourth cup of\nMagnolia Gold butter\n\n\nWe have some white wine one-third cup of white wine\n\n\nWe have one cup of all-purpose cream one cup of all-purpose cream\n\n\n Meron tayong  uh one-half block of Magnolia Cheezee\none-half block of Magnolia Cheezee\n\n\n Tapos meron tayong  one-half teaspoon of salt\none-half teaspoon of salt and one-fourth cup of parsley chopped one-fourth\ncup of chopped parsley\n\n\nOkay what we will do here is we will get our uhm  teka muna\nano bang gagawin natin  okay olive oil two tablespoons of olive oil\nyou have two tablespoons of Magnolia butter\n\n\nAnd the reason we 're doing this is so that  may lasa ho itong\nating uh pampiprito natin dito as ating  pork tenderloin  pero\nhindi ho masusunog dahil mabilis hong masunog ang  butter  'no\n\n \n\n\nSo we 're going to  parang  temper it by adding\nsomething that 's more heat resistant in the form of olive oil\n\n\nNow  ang gagawin natin dito  is we will mix our salt\nand pepper okay and we will season our pork tenderloin\n\n\nOkay season our pork tenderloin  ayan tapos baligtarin lang\nnatin  \n\n\nYou know  meron akong uhm paniniwala dati na ang  pork\ntenderloin  'no  especially or pork  yung mga  \nroast pork and everything  ay kailangang  well done  'no\n\n \n\n\nAnd more often than not  totoo ho yun  but then when\nyou find out when you know the source of the pork  kung nung saan ho\nnanggaling  let 's say  alam nyong malinis ang pinaglakihan\nnung baboy talagang  you know in sanitary surroundings and everything\nthen you can cook the pork even medium medium rare  may mga kumakain\nng mga ganyan 'no pero dito sa Pilipinas  usually well done  \nho natin kinakain yan  \n\n\nBut you know the moment you know where the  yung  \nsource  ng  pork  e palagay nyo nakikita nyo yung baboy\nna naliligo malinis po yung pagkapalaki sa baboy  then you can have\nit uh less than well done okay\n\n\nIf you 'd like to get more recipes from uh Magnolia you

gagawin\nnatin dito  is very simple\n\n\nWe will just get our butter one-fourth cup of butter ohhh  \nmainit din yung ating ano  pan but  gagawin natin para hindi\nmasunog ilagay natin kaagad itong ating  white wine okay\n\n\n Ilagay natin itong ating  all-purpose cream\n\n\nActually this one is just a matter of simmering all these ingredients\ntogether well  para hindi lang uhm masunog lalapot ho nang husto yan\nilagay natin ang ating  salt okay\n\n\n Tapos pag  nag-  melt na ito ito isi-  \nsimmer  ho natin itong ating  sauce for about  siguro\nmga  fifteen minutes okay\n\n\n Ilagay natin

itsura\nnya titingnan natin 'to ito yung ating mga  pork tenderloin  \ndito  \n\n\nLook at that okay\n\n\nWow  ang ganda o  \n\n\n Alam nyo ang napansin ko dito yung ating mga baboy dito sa\nPilipinas ay malalaki na  and I think these these are uh imported uh\n\n yung  pigs  na dito na pinalalaki kaya tingnan mo\n\n even the size of our tenderloin the pork tenderloin  ay\nnapakalaki na rin ano

we 've done something\nlike this before but this one is different in the sense that we are going to\nmarinate our pork in a dip and fry it as such  'no  \n\n\nThis one is called  pork cutlet with shrimp sauce pork\ncutlet with shrimp sauce okay\n\n\nWe have six pieces of pork cutlets cut into half or pork chops if\nyou want\n\n\nJust ordinary pork chops you I prefer if you debone it but you can\nhave it with bone also\n\n\nJust cut it in half and then we have some shrimp paste this is\n\n bagoong  \n\n\nThree tablespoons of  bagoong alamang  or shrimp\npaste you find this in Asian groceries\n\n\nThese are fermented uh tiny shrimps  'no  \n\n\nAnd then we have a teaspoon of sugar one teaspoon of sugar\n\n\nA teaspoon of Chinese wine one teaspoon of Chinese wine or white\nwine will do\n\n\nOne whole egg one whole egg\n\n\nA teaspoon of uh finely chopped shallots one teaspoon of finely\nchopped shallots\n\n\nOne teaspoon of finely chopped garlic also one teaspoon of finely\nchopped garlic\n\n\nTwo tablespoons of cornstarch two tablespoons of cornstarch\n\n\nA teaspoon of chili garlic sauce one teaspoon of chili garlic\nsauce\n\n\nAnd then we have some cooking oil for frying\n\n\nOkay what we will do is we will just mix our cornstarch with our\nwine and our actually it 's just a  matter of mixing all these\ningredients together well\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nI don't know how we will do this it doesn't have that much\n\n\nOh well it will\n\n\nOkay and then we add in one whole egg\n\n\nIf you have any comments suggestions recipe requests please write\nus okay\n\n\nWait let me get a wire whisk here\n\n\nBlend these ingredients yeah\n\n\nYou know the presence of the cornstarch will add crunch to this\ndish\n\n\nWe add in our shallots\n\n\nOkay I will not uh I will be  makulit  about it\n\n\nI 'll remind you again you don't have to just stick to pork chops\n\n\nWhatever suits you chicken or veal if you want lamb if you want\n\n\nOkay garlic we add in our sugar\n\n\nWe add in our shrimp paste\n\n\nAnd blend all of these together well\n\n\nBlend all these together very very well like this\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nAnd we will coat each chop each cutlet with this mixture\n\n\nAnd let it sit for about I would say about an hour in the\nrefrigerator so that each piece absorbs the flavor that you 're trying to get\n\n\nYou know a dish like this requires a lot of rice with rice  \nmasarap po masarap  \n\n\n Halo-halo lang ho lahat yan  \n\n\nOkay\n\n\nThen keep it in the fridge\n\n\nOkay now let 's say let 's say this one is nice and marinated\nalready we will start frying\n\n\nOkay  tingnan natin ito  \n\n\nOkay this is going to splatter I 'm sure\n\n\nYeah\n\n\nOkay this has to be cooked fully okay\n\n\n Di naputol itong  cut  na ito  \n\n\nAnd then like this okay\n\n\nAnd maybe you can have this with some chili catsup if you want uh\nThai chili catsup\n\n\nOkay look at that some of this sauce\n\n\nYou know this shrimp paste is a very popular item in Asia okay\n\n\nThey have uh different versions of this\n\n\nThey they have some that are made out of uh shrimps tiny tiny\nshrimps some that are made out of fish\n\n\nYou know what they do and they  when they  \nmake  nampla  I visited a place that made  nampla\n\n before they get shrimps dump it with plenty plenty of rock salt\nand let that age for about a year and then the juice of that they would uh\nextract the juice of that they would make  nampla  out of\nthat  'no  \n\n\nUh the rock salt will pull out the juices of the from the fish and\nthey would make fish sauce or  nampla  out of that\n\n\nAnd then the remaining fish they would grind to make uh what we\ncall  bagoong balayan  or what uh what 's  I don't\nknow what you call it fish paste or shrimp paste okay\n\n\nSo this one all you have to do is just fry it the moment this is\ndone it will be nice and crunchy it is ready to serve\n\n\nPork cutlet with shrimp sauce guaranteed delicious\n\n\nYou 'll love this  1 1",

time  yung\nginagawang trabaho nung  liquid\n\n\nSo that we are going to steam something else on top okay\n\n\nAnd then we put this fresh garlic for our tomato pilaf and our beef\ncubes also to

aromatic rice with spicy tomato beef  Tita  \n\n\n Kaya lang  before that to our televiewers  'no\n\n I just would like to share that  Tita  Sylvia really\nvalues time\n\n\n Kami rin po sa  \" National \" we\nvalue especially  yung mga  working mothers out there  'no\n\n \n\n\nWe know that it 's really important for them  na mag-\n\n to manage their time as a wife as a mother and of course as a\nprofessional\n\n\nAnd that 's also the reason why \" National \" \nalways comes up with kitchen appliances that brings convenience to the\nhomemakers\n\n\nOkay so to give you a sample\n\n\nOkay today we will prepare aromatic rice using our uh World Series\nrice cooker and spicy tomato beef using our National gas stove\n\n\nWe 'll be needing two cups of both plain rice and  milagrosa\n\n rice  Tita yung mabango po  yes okay\n\n\nThen we 'll be needing seven cups water okay\n\n\n Dito po ihahalo nyo lang ulit lahat ng  ingredients\n\n natin ano  \n\n\nThen we 'll add in two tablespoon of both garlic flakes  at\nsaka yung ating  nutmeg crushed powder okay you can buy this in the\ngroceries  'no  \n\n\nThen we add in one-fourth teaspoon uh turmeric powder  ito\npo yung  to add color and of course  yung  scent\n\n po ng  aroma\n\n\nAnd of course you just put in bell pepper uh sorry the pepper\n\n\nAnd of course we 'll be putting in lemon grass  mga  \ntwo stalks will do\n\n\n Tapos  we 'll add in three hundred grams  ng\n\n uh chicken breast fillet strips  na po yan  okay\n\n\nThen we just mix it then cover and put it in our rice cooker\n\n\nNow  Tita  I was mentioning about \" World\nSeries \" \n\n\nNow I just would like to share that this rice cooker is being\nexported not just in the Philippines but now as well in fifteen different\ncountries all over the world including Japan and U S A okay\n\n\nSo we just put this down for rice cooking\n\n\nNow if you notice  po  uh we have a glass cover\nbecause this model comes with a top pipe steamer so you can actually steam\nyour  ulam siopao  or anything while cooking your rice  \nayon  \n\n\nSo  iwan po muna natin ito  so we 'll cook this for\nabout thirty minutes then let it simmer for fifteen minutes then it 's done\n\n\nSo I was mentioning \" with power flame burner \" \nyes\n\n\nSo  dito nyo po makikita yung  concentrated\ncone-shaped flame that it emits  'no  through the power flame\nburner\n\n\nThirty percent savings because of the heat of time that it cuts let 's\nsay if you boil water in seven minutes through this five minutes  na\nlang  \n\n\nSo let 's put in our oil\n\n\nOkay then let 's stir-fry the garlic okay  naririnig mo na\npo Tita mainit-init na 'to 'no  so  sandaling-sandali lang po\n\n \n\n\n Tapos  the ginger\n\n\nThen we add in three hundred grams of tenderloin cubes  na\npo  \n\n\n Tita di ba  you always mention that it 's important\n\n na  let 's not overcook the meat  ano  \n\n\nWe put now in two teaspoon of white uh sorry one-half teaspoon of\nwhite pepper and the dried chili  mas maanghang mas masarap  \n\n\nSo let 's put in water  Tita  one hundred M L water\nand okay\n\n\nLet 's add in our tomato okay salt\n\n\n Halo lang po tayo ulit ano  \n\n\nThen we add in about two tablespoon tomato paste okay\n\n\nSo we 'll just let it simmer for a minute or a minute-and-a-half\n\n tapos  we 'll add in our uh one-fourth bar of melt cheese to\nmake it more creamier okay\n\n\nOf course after cooking   nandyan yung\n\n hassle of cleaning\n\n\nSo if you see our G P two one one M A S model it already comes\nwith non-stick coating so just use a wet cloth  ano  \n\n\nNow all the assemblies is also detachable the detachable trivet of\ncourse the burner itself is also detachable\n\n\nYes it 's brass yes and also the burner valve is also detachable\n\n\nAlso very important is the three hundred sixty degrees rotatable\ninlet pipe that we always mention  ano  so you don't have to\nworry where to place your gas tank  lalo na pag masikip ang  \nkitchen\n\n\n Di ba yun po ang nagiging  cause  palagi ng\n\n leak  sa ating  gas  yon  \n\n\nSo we 'll just leave that for two minutes and then it 's done\n\n\nUh yes we put in raisins  Tita  and of course the\nfrozen mixed vegetables  pag luto na ito-  toss  lang\nnatin yan   \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nHello everyone uh I really missed our audience and I really\nam glad that I 'm back here in your kitchen Sylvia\n\n\nAnd uh for today we 're going to do some uh very authentic uh dish\n\n na yung bang mga turo ng mga lola natin  \n\n\nWe will be using uh Monterey  pata pata  sliced\n\n\n Makita mo ang ganda di ba  and it looks so clean\nand uh  talagang makita nyo  very very lean okay\n\n\nSo you know when you buy  pata  in the meat\nshop you can specify whether you want it whole for  pata tim\n\n or for this particular uh dish if you want it cut up\n\n\n Kasi  it 's kind of hard to chop  pata\n\n at home because of the bone chips so it 's pre pre-sliced already\n\n dahil meron silang  meat saw\n\n\nYeah but you know\n\n\nSo we 'll put the vinegar just dump this all together brown sugar\ngarlic  wala  in any  ano  in any order  \npwede yan  \n\n\n Tapos toyo  black beans  tausi oo tausi\n\n \n\n\nAnd let 's put some chopped peppercorns and some bay leaf okay\n\n\nAnd of course water  para  we will boil the\n\n pata  in this\n\n\nNow if you 're in a hurry there 's no problem you can use a\npressure cooker okay  lang yun  \n\n\nThis takes about an hour or an hour and a half  kasi\nmasarap nito yung medyo  gelatinous  na  \n\n\nSo we just put this in the pan all together and then just close\nthis and uh cook it over boiling then simmering until it 's tender\n\n\nSo  lutuin natin  close it  para  \nthe heat will be even all throughout\n\n\nAnd uh also we can put the banana blossom  o yung tawag\nnatin usbong ng saging  \n\n\nIt gives a sweetish taste\n\n\n Alam mo  Sylvs  sa Amerika  hit\n\n na  hit  talaga ang  Asian dishes\n\n\nYes so here 's our finished product\n\n\n Gusto ko 'to kasi manamis-namis na maalat-alat  \n\n\nSee wow look at that\n\n\n Masarap yan sa mainit na kanin  wow  \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nYou 're gonna be sitting nice and tall\n\n\nI think you need to hold a  fitness circle  yeah\n\n\nSitting nice and tall think of using your abdominals\n\n\nTwo lengthen your spine up\n\n\nInhale to prepare\n\n\nWhen you exhale initiate the movement by curling your tailbone on\nthis scooping the abdominals yes\n\n\nThink of your navel touching your spine\n\n\nGonna aim now think of you gonna reach up the  navel  \n\n\nThink of hugging a beach ball there you go\n\n\nExhale curl in your tailbone on this scoop the abs squeeze the\nbuttocks tight your ribs sliding down to your hip\n\n\nInhale up to the  navel  crown of the head <unclear> 1 word\n\n</unclear \n\n\nShoulder sliding down\n\n\nRelax your shoulder  swing  \n\n\nThere you go\n\n\nExhale\n\n\nCurl your tailbone under scoop the abs connect the ribs yes\n\n\nInhale up the  navel  scooping the abs\n\n\nThere you go yes\n\n\nExhale\n\n\nHalf roll back\n\n\nWe 'll make that more intense and stay there\n\n\nTry to squeeze the circle on the full ten on the exhale\n\n\nAnd nine and eight\n\n\nTighten the abs\n\n\nThere you go\n\n\nSink <unclear> 2 words </unclear> to back yeah\n\n\nAnd six and five and four and three and two and one\n\n\nAlright there you go\n\n\nYes so what Joseph Pilates promised in ten sessions you 'll feel\ndifferent in twenty you 'll look different in thirty sessions you have a new\nbody\n\n\nWe teach in <unclear> 1 word </unclear> Studio in

{"text": "<$A> \n\nDuring the last uh consecutive weeks we have uh studied the\nchemical tests related to aldehydes ketones alcohols amines carboxylic acids\n\n\nAnd I presume and I hope that you have made a comprehensive record\nin your lab notebook about the observations that you uh uh nah you saw\n\n 'no  \n\n\nThis afternoon uh we will put to our final test all the things that\nyou have learned\n\n\nI will give you ten uh unknown liquids uhm and, by group one\ngroup one sample\n\n\nYou have to be judicious in their use because it 's a limited amount\nso uh use only the prescribed amount in your uh um tests last several weeks\n\n\nYou will have to identify what uh liquid it is and to give you\nincentive the first person who can uh submit to me  o  who can\nwho can tell me the correct identification the first group I will award a\nten-point extra bonus  'no  \n\n\nThe second place uh will be given a seven-point bonus and the third\nplace a five-point bonus\n\n\nHaste make waste if you come to me with the identification and it is\nwrong I will deduct three points\n\n\nI will deduct that 's why you have to be careful\n\n\nNow uh this is this is where the value of your lab notebook comes\nin\n\n\nIf you took if you did the experiment last time and you were\nhelter-skelter with the observation you will spend a lot of time uh\nidentifying these because your observations might be inconclusive\n\n\nAnyway all of the reagents uh relevant to the analysis are uh\nlined-up at the back\n\n\n  there are uh amine reagents carboxylic acid reagents\nalcohol reagents and ketone reagents\n\n\nSo I think before you uh embark uh before you embark on the\nchemical test you have to plan out your strategy  'no  how you\nwill go about it\n\n\nPerhaps secure four test tubes and then uh among the four sets of\nreagents uh on hand you choose the surefire method of identifying a ketone a\nsurefire method of identifying an alcohol a surefire method of amines\n\n etcetera  so you would be able to identify once and for\nall that  this is an amine group and then you have to focus on\nthat and then identify whether it 's a primary amine secondary amine tertiary\namine you know what I mean\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nYes  \n\n\nYou go back   ha  \n\n\nWell  uh you you have to\nget  self-consistent result\n\n\nIf one test is positive and then you come to me with the\nidentification I will look for confirmation confirmatory evidence  di\nba  \n\n\nAnd uh when you have the confirmatory evidence then you are sure\nand the chances are you won't be wrong  \n\n\nImagine that uh imagine that you 're a practicing medical doctor\nand you extracted a liquid from a patient 's uh stomach and this is it and\nyou want to know what the what 's the cause of the death  'no  \n\n\nSo you have to identify alright\n\n\nUh I was thinking that the first place uh winner uh we will uh we\nwill put on the victory stand and we will sing the national anthem for him or\nher but we are all Filipinos we 'll be singing one national anthem right\n\n\n Maliban  uh apart from the Chinese in the group or\nKorean or Japanese  mayroon bang  Japanese  sa inyo\n\n \n\n\nNone\n\n\nAnyway so uh I need not elaborate on the tests because it can be\nquite complicated\n\n\nThe records in your lab notebook of your observations should be\nsufficient so uh I will now assign you the compound samples that we have  \n\n\nYeah\n\n\nWhen your tests when you have when you have performed several\nconfirmatory tests   for example you have a liquid you added diphenyl hydrazone\nand it formed crystals on like in your observation then perhaps what you need\nto do is repeat it\n\n\nGet another drop and then test it it gives\n\n\nThen uh what other what other test or ketones do you have so test\nthat also\n\n\nSo when those tests are jibing together then that means you have a\ngood uh a reasonable basis for your conclusion okay\n\n\nOne test does not constitute a conclusion okay\n\n\nSo  kumpleto  are we complete  nine twelve fifteen we are only nineteen one person missing\n\n\n Ha  Johnson Tan  he\nmight arrive he might arrive later\n\n\nAnyway I 'll distribute now your unknown sample uh Group one\n\n teka muna  Group one De Leon okay so please okay I will give\nyou sample four\n\n\nFive okay number five to Group one\n\n\nGroup two Group two I 'll give to the group the hardest one okay\nnumber ten okay\n\n\nThey they 're all the same difficulty  'no  \n\n\nGroup one number ten uh Quiambao Quiambao and Feig okay\n\n\nWho 's your partner\n\n\nUh the uh Group seven Group seven I 'll give number one Ilagan okay\n\n\nGroup uh  ay  wait a minute Group seven one\n\n\nGroup five Leonor and who 's the partner of Leonor, Natanawan\n\n\nEight okay  ano ano ang </indigo> group <indigo> mo  \n\n\nNumber five number eight\n\n\nAlright uh number two will be given to Group eight eight Toledo and\nSayas okay\n\n\nDo not do not use lots amount of it\n\n\nTwo two will be yours okay\n\n\nOffhand I do not know what those chemicals are I do not know\n\n\nI have no complete record I have no uh list from the stock\npersonnel yet\n\n\nI just gave him instructions to make this for me\n\n\nAlright uh Group six Tan and Kayla you 're yours is three\n\n\nThen number four I will give to Group Group ten Group ten this is\nCo and Quiambao uh no no Co and Panagsagan\n\n\nAlright alright\n\n\nBy the way if we should finish the identification today in next\nmeeting, check-out unless you want to work some more\n\n\nI don't either okay\n\n\nNumber number nine I 'll give you number six  baligtaran\n\n number nine who is your partner Romero, Arriola alright number\nsix\n\n\nYou have  beg your pardon\n\n\nIn your notebook create a \" next experiment \" \nidentification of an unknown\n\n\nWrite in your notebook the unknown number and then you 'll proceed\nwith analysis\n\n\nAlright number seven will have to go to number four\n\n\nWho is yeah number seven uh that is Chua and San Pedro okay do you\nhave yet\n\n\nOkay so your group is Jimenez three nine okay nine okay\n\n\nOkay so please\n\n\nOkay you can secure uh one of these uh medicine uh  \ndroppers  'no  \n\n\nI think this is for uh putting uh  uh drops on babies\n\n 'no  all the way to the stomach  'no  \n\n\nUh one of these and use this only for your sample\n\n\nMake sure you do not cross-contaminate your sample with any liquids\nthat makes your reaction or experiment inconclusive  'no  \n\n\nGet one each and don't break the tip alright  \n\n\nOh yeah\n\n\nAnd also <.> d </. do not  make sure that you do not\ntouch the liquids on the inside of the rubber\n\n\nIt will contaminate your sample okay\n\n\nGet one each okay\n\n\nUh, all systems are go alright\n\n\nNow if you uh if you care, you you have to do your work more\nsystematically uh  not just because that I gave you incentives to\nuh get the first result means that you 'll have to be haphazard alright\n\n\nGood luck  <subtext.2> \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nOkay so for the in order to get the pulse rate okay so this is\nthe machine that we would be using so it 's called the \" Power Lab\n\n\" okay  in-  advertise  pa  okay\n\n\nPower Lab it comes with this software so it 's just linked to a it\nalso comes with a card\n\n\nOkay  alam nyo ba yung  card  sa  \ncomputer  yung di ba may  sound card  ganyan  \nvideo card\n\n\nIt it comes with this special card okay called the  Scassi  \ncard okay\n\n\nI don't have to elaborate what Scassi means it 's just um a\ntechnical jargon again\n\n\nScassi card  ano nga ba yun o mamaya titingnan natin yon\nnakalimutan ko  \n\n\nOkay so this is connected to you have cables here connected to a\nScassi card  sa  computer okay\n\n\nSo that Scassi card is responsible for okay actually processing\nyour signals okay\n\n\nSo to get the pulse rate so this is uh this is our sensor okay it 's\nthe sensor that we would be using\n\n\nThis is called a \" finger pulse transducer \" so\nanother word for \" sensor \" is \" transducer\n\n\" okay\n\n\nSo later on you would place uh one finger the tip of your fingers\nhere okay the middle finger that you would use later on\n\n\nOkay so  ilalagay nyo siya sa  Channel one  \npakikabit naman sa  Channel one  o  \n\n\nChannel one this one\n\n\nOkay  na naka- </indigo> lock  na  \n\n\n Parang  oscilloscope just like an oscilloscope\n\n\nAyan\n\n\nOkay so once that is uh okay  nakakabit na yan  so\nwe  you put this one  doon sa  middle the tip of\nyour middle finger okay\n\n\nUh put it in this way in such a way that this is  nakalagay\ndito  okay  hindi doon sa  opposite side actually\n\n puede rin sa  opposite side but this is  much\nconvenient way to do\n\n\nOkay so once this is all set up uh what you do would be to click\nthis one chart for \" Windows \" okay\n\n\nOn double click so  tingnan nyo yan dapat nag-  \norange  yan  okay\n\n\nSo that means that the machine and the computer is communicating\n\n\nOkay so you would uh have this one when you start it up you 'd\nhave this uh so  ang dami di ba  so you have a lot of uh\nwindows so we would just close this one 'cause we do not need this one okay\n\n\nSo what we would need so you open so open this is an open dialogue\nbox  hindi diyan  okay so  ilagay na punta lang kayo sa\n\n C program files  sa  A V I Instruments this was the\ncompany which built that machine\n\n\n\" Experiment settings \" okay so these are simply\nlike templates okay\n\n\n Para hindi nyo na kayo mag-  adjust  ng mga\n\n windows  'no naka-adjust na yang mga  windows for\ndifferent experiments\n\n\nLike now we would this is an introductory so pulse rate so we\nwould do this uh next time E C G uh E M G okay E E G okay\n\n\nSo we would be doing that okay\n\n\nSo we open so we have this so  naka  set-up  \nna yung  experiment okay\n\n\nSo before uh so you maximize this  para walang problema\n\n okay  ha  okay  lang yon  okay\n\n\nSo the first thing that you do so the first thing that so once\nthis is already set up so you choose this one  nakalagay  \nChannel one okay\n\n\nSo you choose inpunt  input input\namplifier okay\n\n\nSo  makikita nyo diyan ano di ba  so the range is\nten volts so ten volts there negative ten volts at the bottom so what does\nthat mean\n\n\nSo  napaka  so  wala kang makita halos\n\n that means that the range is too too large okay\n\n\n E sabi natin yung mga  bioelectric signals they\nare very very small okay\n\n\nSo we adjust this one  depende 'to sa tao ha may mga ibang\ntao malakas yung  pulse rate  yung  amplitude\n\n\nSo let 's say  ilagay ko siya sa  two hundred\n\n masyado pa ring mababa ilagay ko sa  one hundred millivolts\n\n mababa pa rin  \n\n\nOkay so fifty let 's say  ayan  okay  \n\n\nSo let 's uh click \" O K \" \n\n\nSo this means that this range actually this uh this process here\nis just for you to know the correct range okay\n\n\nSo  yung  correct range which in this case is fifty\nmillivolts okay\n\n\nSo we click \" O K \" \n\n\n Pakita ko sa inyo  how you store this data okay\n\n\nSo click \" O K \" okay\n\n\nAnd then once you uh  na naka-  ready  na\n\n fifty millivolts so you can start recording  kanina hindi pa\nnagre-  record you 're just actually like calibrating your um the\nrange okay\n\n\nSo \" Start \" would mean \" recording\n\n\" okay\n\n\nSo  iyon na yun  so let 's record for  ilan\nkaya  uh let 's say ten seconds\n\n\nTen seconds  o sobra na gawin nating  twenty five\nseconds  o  twenty seconds  na lang  \n\n\nOkay so you already have your that 's only only temporary so\ntemporary  lang siyang naka-  store okay stored in the memory\nof your computer okay\n\n\nUhm so once you have have you have this now once you have that you\ncan actually save this uh save  natin ha  \" File\n\n\" \n\n\nSo \" Save As \" so  ilagay natin gawa tayo\nng  folder for all of you\n\n\nSo uh, so you place the file name like for example Pulse rate\nokay\n\n\nSo you save it in this type of file A V I chart A V I C H T okay\n\n\nUh if you save your file so  ito ise-  save  \nnyo rin 'to ha  save your file in this format  pero syempre\n\n later on we would like to open this this uh the one that you\nrecorded also in Excel in Word also\n\n\nLet 's say uh you want to present that later on okay so later on\n\n pakita ko sa inyo  on how to save this uh recorded signal\n\n sa  Excel  sa  Word also okay  \n\n\nOkay so next step so we have this temporarily recorded uh\nbioelectrical pulse rate so what 's the next step\n\n\nYou have to compute for the pulse period okay so you could either\nmove this uh cursor  nakita nyo iyong  X\n\n\nSo place it at the peak  nasaan yung  peak\n\n\n O ayan  then you get the time in seconds then you\nmove to the next peak which is this one, okay\n\n\nSo  kunyari yan medyo  sensitive  siya ayan\n\n \n\n\nSo that 's the time for the next peak so to get the so  \nyung kailangan mo yung  period so you get the time interval\n\n\nSo the time that you got a while ago and this one so this one\nminus this one that is your pulse period but there 's an easier way  \nkasi medyo mahirap yan kasi tatantyahin mo pa di ba  \n\n\nYou could either so let 's just pick so  piliin natin itong\n\n portion  lang na 'to  okay\n\n\n Sobra mali mali  \n\n\nSo  magtiyaga kayo sa  mouse\n\n\nSo let 's uh choose this uh  itong dalawang  peaks\n\n na 'to  \n\n\nWe can actually zoom into this peak  para mas madali\n\n okay\n\n\nSo let 's zoom so you choose this button so that button at the top\n\n itong nasa itaas ha  this one  nakalagay naman e\nlalabas naman e  \n\n\nZoom window and then if you want to find the time interval so\n\n lagyan natin ng  mark so drag  ito  \n\n\nYou place it at the this first peak  ang hirap ayan\nnilagyan nyo ng  mark\n\n\nThen you place this one on the next peak the X  ang hirap\n\n okay  may sariling utak 'to   .\n\n\nSo as you can see there  nasaan na yun nandoon e nagtatago\n\n \n\n\n Delta  okay it 's right over here  ay\nnawala  \n\n\nOkay so it 's the the one there  yung nandoon nakita nyo\n\n point zero\n\n\nUh  teka dito na lang sa  remote  eto na\nlang  \n\n\nActually it 's  Delta  T okay  Delta\n\n T\n\n\nSo if you use this mark  yung  M you have uh you\nwould uh measure at once the time interval  Delta  T\n\n\nSo  Delta  T is point  ano yun saan na\nyun  so point five seven five\n\n\nAnd that is your pulse period okay so pulse period okay so from\nthere you get the pulse rate just take the reciprocal\n\n\nOkay so  ilagay nyo rin na  pulse  sa\n\n rate pulse per second and pulse per minute before exercise then\nafter this uh after getting your pulse rate uhm before exercise so  \nmag-  bike  kayo  for  lahat kayo  \n\n\n Tig-isa lang ito  so uh take turns okay\n\n\n Ma-  experience  nyo rin lahat  \n\n\nOkay so while uh one group while one group is busy here the rest\nof you I want you to think about your project that you would be doing okay", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ad9b7ee6-013b-4898-82e9-55efb616b515", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.230435+00:00"}

excellent\n\n\nNow what we have here is some  pan de sal  our normal\n\n pan de sal  \n\n\nAnd what we did we just got a spoon and we scooped out the middle\n\n\nAs you can see there are holes we took out the  laman\n\n and that will be our bread it 's like a mini-bread bowl okay\n\n\nThen we have here of course our number one product uhm  \nnapakasarap po nito  excellent Prego spaghetti sauce wow\n\n\nIf you haven't tried this this is it\n\n\nThis is the product we all love Prego uhm\n\n\nAnd it smells so good it 's terrific\n\n\nIt 's only thirty-three pesos so go out there and buy yourself a\nPrego  napakasarap po nito  \n\n\nPeople this is one class-A product\n\n\nSo what we 're gonna do is we 're gonna put this in the bowl okay\none can and then we have here of course some tuna\n\n\nYou can use tuna chunks or tuna flakes whatever you like to use\nthis is  sarap ha  it 's a winner\n\n\nSo we 're just gonna put that there and then we also have some\ncanned vegetables now mixed vegetables\n\n\nWe got our corn we got our green peas our carrots very colorful\nvery healthy\n\n\nOf course we all need our vitamins and minerals we get it from\nthese so put it there like so\n\n\nAnd then what we 're gonna do is we 're just gonna mix all these\ngreat ingredients together okay and we 're just gonna put in our green bowl\n\n\nAw it look at that okay\n\n\nAnd then to top it we have some cheese and you can use any type of\ncheese you like\n\n\nYou can use cheddar cheese or quickmelt cheese or whatever cheese\nyou like\n\n\nAnd then put that on top\n\n\nAnd then we 're

{"text": "<$A> \n\n nursery of the Institute of Forest Conservation at U P L B and with us is Dr Jose Sarjento of the Institute, and uh Dr Sarjento is going to demonstrate to us a very important skill important to our survival, \n\n\nDr Sarjento or can I call you Joe\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay Joe we all know that trees are a very important resource and if only each Filipino will be able to plant a tree then that would mean about more than sixty million trees\n\n\nNow my question is this\n\n\nWould it be possible for elementary school children to be involved in tree-planting activities\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah it is very much possible\n\n\nIn fact uh tree-planting is fun\n\n\nAnd it is uh a source of survival\n\n\nIt 's a life-supporting activity\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh because many people believe that uh only adults should be involved in tree planting and uh if you are saying that even small children can do that would you be kind enough to demonstrate to us the different steps in planting a tree\n\n\nSo uhm Joe what do we have here\n\n\nAre these uh common species that uh you use in your tree planting projects\n\n<$B> \n\nYes uh this one is uh our national tree\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nThis is we call it  narra  \n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\n Terocarpus Indicus  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd the other one this one, is a South American tree\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\n Pina Matopilla  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nThese are two main reforestation species in the country\n\n<$A> \n\nI see\n\n\nCould you please show us the different steps to follow in planting a tree\n\n<$B> \n\nUh this is the first step is to uh select the planting stock  ,  \n\n\nYou have to select uh in terms of uh size  ,  or in terms of age or in terms of vigor\n\n<$A> \n \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo  I would like to show to you the different sizes of  ,  seedlings\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nFor example this is a  narra  seedling\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nAnother  narra  seedling\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh these are three  narra  seedlings\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nUh in in our condition in the Philippines   since  we plant this in the mountain  ,  and usually covered with grasses\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n Yes   \n\n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nThis is the right size of   planting  material\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nThis ranges from ten to twelve months old\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo this is the right size\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nSo if you plant potted seedlings this is the right size\n\n<$A> \n\nThe things to remember are the size  ,  correct size and the right age\n\n<$B> \n\n The size   \n\n\nThe right age and also the the health\n\n\nUh, I 'd like to show to you uh, for instance uh this one this is a  narra  seedling\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd take note uh that this is damaged\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nThis is attacked by insect\n\n<$A> \n\nYes yes\n\n<$B> \n\nUh be sure not to plant a seedling which is damaged by insect\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nChoose a seedling which is healthy\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nThis is a healthy seedling\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay Joe once we have selected the seedling what do we do next\n\n<$B> \n\nThe the the next thing is to prepare for outplanting\n\n\nWe have to transfer these in the field\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh for potted seedlings we usually place this in a bag\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWe have to place this in a bag and avoid having this damaged while transporting this\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nNow since most of our mountains are already bald and far from the town  ,  we have to transport as many seedlings possible in our bag\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nSo we usually use, uh bare root stock\n\n\nAnd I would like to show to you later on how are we going to package this \n\n<$A> \n\n  Uh huh  \n\n<$B> \n\n To   put this in a container  ,  so that we could bring as many seedlings  ,  in the field \n\n<$A> \n\n Uh huh   \n\n\n Uh huh   \n\n\nDr Sarjento will now show us how to prepare and pack the seedlings for transport to the planting site\n\n\nOkay Joe\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay, \n\n\nI have here seedlings of mahogany\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh this is bare root seedlings\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm \n\n<$B> \n\nThis is a potted seedling\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd this is uh, this is heavy to transport\n\n<$A> \n\n  Yes  \n\n<$B> \n\n If you 'd   like to transport  ,  fifty or one hundred seedlings to the planting site\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nRight\n\n<$B> \n\nBut this is lighter  ,  because there are no soil uh covering this\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd I would like to show to you how to prepare this\n\n\nFirst we 'll start with the root system\n\n\n  We 'll cut  the top root\n\n<$A> \n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd next is to remove\n\n<$A> \n\n  Some of the leaves  \n\n<$B> \n\n Some of the leaves    ,  so that the transpiration will be minimized\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay, \n\n\nWe 'll ah reduce this\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh, once you have reduced this  ,  more or less you will have a balanced uh root system  ,  on the top\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n Yes   \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd uh once you have done this   we 'll  we 'll bundle this and uh this is a bundle of about fifty  ,  fifty seedlings  ,  of mahogany\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Yes   \n\n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd  when you bundle this make sure that the root collar will be at the same level\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay like this\n\n<$A> \n\nYes uh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo the root collar are almost at the same level\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd when you plant make sure that the root system is uh protected by way of keeping it moist\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay to keep it moist we need a moist retention medium\n\n\nWe have here uh clay  ,  and we just mix it with water  ,  and now we have mud  ,  and this will keep the  the root system moist for some time\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\n Yes   \n\n\nUh-huh uh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo to  \n\n<$A> \n\nSo you cover the root\n\n<$B> \n\nOnce you have prepared the mud\n\n<$A> \n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nWe dip this in the mud  ,  up to the root collar only\n\n<$A> \n\n I see   \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause if you dip this deeper up to this portion  ,  this will cause the rotting  ,  of the stem\n\n\nSo make sure that  ,  only the root system\n\n\nAnd once it is uh deep in the in the mud  ,  we put this in our banana this is a banana sheet\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n Uh uhm   \n\n\n Only the roots   \n\n\n Uh-huh   \n\n\nYes\n\n<$B> \n\nCover this like this\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd then we tie this\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nElmo kindly could you please help me\n\n<$A> \n\nSo that 's another use for the  saha  \n\n<$B> \n\nYeah okay\n\n\nTake note that these are degradable materials  ,  'no   \n\n<$A> \n\n Yes that 's right   \n\n<$B> \n\nPlastics are generally non-degradable\n\n<$A> \n\nYes uh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo the most important thing is the method and the materials, will be environment friendly\n\n<$A> \n\nYes right\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay, \n\n\nNow we are in the planting site and the first thing to do in when you reach the planting site is to make sure that the site is properly prepared  'no  \n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nWe have cut the grasses weeds and then placed a marker for every planting spot okay\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm yes\n\n<$B> \n\nNow before we plant I would like to show to you the the seedlings that we have just prepared and transported\n\n<$A> \n\nSo you start with the bare root   seedling  \n\n<$B> \n\n And uh   I will start with the bare root seedling\n\n\nI 'll pick up one  ,  this one and I would like to repeat this is the root collar\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes,   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd when we plant this seedling make sure that you plant at this level only  ,  when you plant bare root seedling we could use a simple stick\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nOr if you have a crowbar we do it like this\n\n<$A> \n\nYeah\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay, \n\n\nWe we call this as a slip method\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nBecause after removing the the the bar  ,  we just insert this  ,  and we could just stamp it with your, with your uh foot  ,  and then put a marker\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\n Yes   \n\n\n Yes   \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nOkay\n\n<$A> \n\nWhat is the correct distance between the seedlings\n\n<$B> \n\nNormally the correct distance varies from one meter  ,  to two meters\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nIt depends on the species\n\n<$A> \n\nUh uhm\n\n<$B> \n\nFor  narra  or mahogany the recommended spacing is two meters by two meters\n\n<$A> \n\nTwo meters by two meters\n\n<$B> \n\nYeah\n\n<$A> \n\nSo it 's  it 's really a very simple procedure\n\n<$B> \n\nYes yes\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nThe next thing that I will demonstrate is how to plant a potted seedling\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay, \n\n<$B> \n\nNow we have have a seedling of  narra  and take note that we have here uh the the soil covering the root system\n\n<$A> \n\nOkay\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd make sure when you plant this  ,  minimize the destruction of the bowl of soil\n\n<$A> \n\n Yes   \n\n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nSo first we dig the soil\n\n<$A> \n\nYes \n\n<$B> \n\nOkay, \n\n\nMake sure that the depth of the of the hole is similar to the height or the depth of the root system\n\n<$A> \n\nUh-huh\n\n<$B> \n\nAnd so we 'll try this like this but of course one important thing to do is to

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWe 're using the chunks in water  yung  red\nlabel  natin  because the red label is the versatile type of\ntuna of tuna wherein you can add it to a lot of things  'no  \n\n\nVegetables you can add it to uhm  tawag dito  to\nsalads to soups just about to any any recipe that you would want to put tuna\ninto\n\n\nSo we have a very nice uh bowl here  ia-  assemble\n\n lang natin yung ating  salad yes  may  custom\nplate\n\n\nSo we have here\n\n\nAnd then we have lettuce  'no lalagay lang natin dun sa\n\n bottom  nung ating  salad bowl shredded  ng\nganito  Sylvs  'no  \n\n\n 'Yon  \n\n\nHave it shredded like that and then you start to build up  \nlang ibi-  build up  lang natin yung  salad  \nkumbaga  building-up means  parang pagpapatong-patungin lang\nnatin  \n\n\nSo we have carrots finely chopped  'no papatong lang natin\nsiya  \n\n\nIf you want to cut it  medyo malalaki para medyo parang uh\nmas  chunky  siya  you can do that  'no\n\n \n\n\nAnd then we have uh green eh I mean sorry red bell pepper\n\n\nYou can even cut this into strips if you want  'no kaya lang\n\n we 're doing it  medyo  on a uniform scale\n\n\nSo we have uhm onions sliced  'no  we 're using\nwhite onions  para medyo  sweeter  ang dating niya\n\n okay\n\n\nAnd then we have our capers  'no sa ibabaw din  \n\n\nAnd then we have our tuna  yung  tuna  natin\npapatong lang din natin sa ibabaw  so we can put that whole can in\nthere\n\n\nWe 're using two cans of Century Tuna just spread that on top\n\n\nAnd then we can uhm sprinkle it with a little uhm this is coriander\nleaves  'no  chopped  dyan lang sa ibabaw  \n\n\nIt 's  wansoy   oo  cilantro\n\n\n Iwan tayo ng kaunti  while we move to our next\nprocedure Sylvs which is preparing our dressing okay\n\n\nSo for our dressing we have a bowl here  ayan ho meron\ntayong uhm  sour cream\n\n\n Alam mo  almost all Mexican food they love to put\nsour cream and lime and avocado  litsugas at keso sa kanila  \nand corn plays a very important uh role  kasi di ba  they they\ndance they dance for rain  para mag-  grow  yung\n\n corn  nila  \n\n\nThen we add a little hot sauce and then  meron tayong\n\n cumin  yung  cumin  na nabibili natin dito\n\n ground  na  \n\n\nThese are actually uh comes from seed  'no  and then\nyou toast them  maganda nga  if you toast them freshly and\nthen you grind grind it  na para mas matindi yung  flavor but\nfor convenience you can use already the this mayonnaise\n\n\nSo  imi-  mix  lang natin  until very\nsmooth okay and then we add a little bit of lime juice  'no kung wala\nsilang  lime juice they can use  calamansi  or lemon\nlemon juice  ayan  \n\n\nWe can put our dressing on top layer it and then we have avocado\n\n pa  Sylvs  'no  to go on top\n\n\nSo well uhm let 's just pour everything there\n\n\nWhat we 're going to do next is put our avocado wedges on top\n\n panahon ng </indigo> avocado <indigo> kaya  \n\n\nBut this is actually this is good fat you know\n\n\nAvocado is considered a fat but it 's good fat because it 's uhm\nlow cholesterol yes\n\n\n Maganda kung medyo hindi masyadong  ripe  \nyung  avocado so it holds better\n\n\nAnd then we have some uhm cilantro leaves  'no  that\nyou can put there  eto yun  to give it a very fresh look\n\n ayan  \n\n\nThere you go our Mexican tuna salad from Century  \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n Pinakbet  with Century Tuna  ayan\n\n uh  alam mo  Sylvs the usual traditional  \npinakbet na ginagawa natin  \n\n\nBut  alam mo pag pumunta ka kasi sa  Ilocos region\n\n ano  they put uh  bagnet  in your  \npinakbet oo kaya lang minsan ang nangyayari kung mayroon kang  \nhypertension or  umiiwas ka sa sa  red meat it 's nice to to\nuse an alternative  'no  \n\n\nSo you have the super meat Century Tuna  na siyang gagawin\nnating parang  crispy tuna  na gagawin nating  topping\nfor our  pinakbet  \n\n\nSo  yung  procedure  natin  we have\ntwo cans of Century Tuna chunky  talaga grabe 'yan  and\n\n ang gagawin natin  Sylvs is uh  lalagyan ho natin ng\nkonting asin 'no  \n\n\nAnd then uhm over here  nagpainit tayo ng  uhm oil\n\n 'no  and we 're going to deep fry our tuna  hanggang\nsa maging  brown\n\n\nWhen we deep fry  mainit na yung ating  cooking oil\n\n kailangan tatakpan natin kasi nga may  moisture  siya\n\n \n\n\nSo we will let that fry  'no i-  fry  lang\nnatin siya hanggang sa maging  light brown\n\n\n Yun pag naging  light brown  siya ganito na\nyung magiging hitsura niya  but we will set that aside this is like\nit 's crunchy it 's crispy it 's very tasty and then with a little oil\n\n 'no  the usual procedure  lang yung ating bawang 'no 'yan\n\n \n\n\nAnd then we have  konting  ginger  kasi may\nbagoong isda tayo hindi bagoong alamang  which is one kind\n\n\nSo  pag nag-umpisa na siyang mainit  we start adding\nour next ingredient which is  yung ating sibuyas 'no  \n\n\nAnd then  kamatis yung kamatis natin ginawa nating  \nchunk very chunky  yung kamatis para magbigay din siya ng magandang\n\n sauce\n\n\nSo  yung sabaw  about two cups of tomatoes  \nayan  \n\n\nSo we this is our  bagoong isda 'no  very very\naromatic  ito yung magpapalasa  \n\n\n Mapapansin mo wala na tayong asin walang vetsin  \nbecause this is good enough to taste to  ano  to flavor your\nuhm  pinakbet 'no  \n\n\nSo  ilalagay natin yung ating kalabasa  so you start\nwith the  matitigas  first so this is  kalabasa\n\n \n\n\n Sabay-sabay na natin 'no  and then we will just\ncover it this is our okra  'no ilalagay lang natin diyan sa ibabaw at\nsaka pag naggugulay tayo huwag nating haluin nang haluin  \n\n\nAnd then this is our uh eggplant  na hiniwa natin ng ganito\nibinabad lang sa tubig para di mangitim  \n\n\nSo  tatakpan natin hanggang lumambot siya  and\ncooked half-way\n\n\nWell this is about ready already  ayan tingnan mo o  \nvery nice you still have the intense green color  'no  and\nthen we take it off the heat  'no  and then we <unclear> words\n\n</unclear> there  sa  platter  natin 'no  \n\n\nSo get this  ise-  serve  natin dito  \n\n\nYou have to  pagka-  fry  nyo  you\nhave to drain it from the oil Sylvs  'no para hindi masyadong  \noily but as it is  mukhang napakasarap nito  \n\n\nOr you can sprinkle it or if you want you can serve it on the side\n\n pa rin 'no  sprinkle it yes\n\n\nLow cholesterol  'no  you fry it in corn oil very\nvery little oil this is low fat  pinakbet   \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nAnd we 're going to do this very special recipe for you out\nthere\n\n\nWe call it baked potatoes with cottage cheese and tuna\n\n\nIt 's another healthy dish  'no na  making use of\npotatoes  'no  which is very rich in potassium and of course\n\n ang ating bida  Century Tuna chunks in water\n\n\nAnd the nice thing about it is we 're going to mix it together with\ncottage cheese  'no  \n\n\nSo very uhm high   ito  high protein\n\n talaga  but first  pakita ko lang  Sylvia\n\n kung  how they 're going to uhm deal with their baked\npotatoes  'no  \n\n\nSo you have potatoes  na ganito kalalaki 'no  this\nis ideal for baked potatoes\n\n\n Kailangan ii-  scrub  nila  using a\nvegetable brush  'no wag naman yung gamit na  toothbrush\nvegetable brush  ho ano o kaya uh basta  any brush  na\nmalinis  and then really really scrub it  'no  \n\n\n Kasi  you can eat the skin and it 's very very\nhealthy\n\n\nAnd then you get a little bit of uhm shortening  'no\n\n shortening  kukuha ka lang kayo gayon  you have to\nrub the whole thing\n\n\nSo  mantikang puti  yes so  ira-  rub\n\n natin yan 'no  \n\n\nAnd using a foil to keep and lock in the the goodness of your uhm\nwhat do you call this of your potatoes  'no iaano natin siya\nibabalutin natin 'no  \n\n\nSo you seal that  'no  \n\n\nStick it in the oven at three-seventy-five for thirty to forty\nminutes okay so  lalagay natin diyan  \n\n\nBut we have already a finished product\n\n\n Binake na namin kasi  we 're not gonna wait for\nthat long\n\n\n Eto na yung  finished product  natin\n\n \n\n\nSo  umpisahan na natin ang ating  topping or filling\n\n 'no  \n\n\nSylvs it 's a very very simple procedure  'no  \n\n\nSo all we need is uhm  yung ating  cottage cheese\n\n ilalagay lang natin  you strain the excess liquid  'no\n\n \n\n\n Lagay nyo lang sa sa  strainer  para hindi\nmasyadong basa\n\n\nUh  pwede rin ang  cheddar cheese  basta ige-\n\n grate  mo lang siya  \n\n\nAnd then you have a little bit of mayonnaise okay and then and then\n\n itong ating  chopped celery\n\n\nYeah this will add crunch and texture into our uhm tuna  'no\n\n \n\n\nAnd then your chunks in water  ayan magandang gamitin\n\n red label guaranteed  mas maraming laman 'no punung-puno\n\n \n\n\nAnd then onions  'no  white onions nice for fish\nokay\n\n\nAnd then a squeeze of  calamansi  or lemon together\nwith  'no  \n\n\nAnd salt and pepper  minix na natin yung  salt and\npepper  natin  \n\n\nSo  maganda ito kung ichi-  chill  mo ng\nkonti sa  fridge  'no  uhm for about twenty minutes\nbut we can  already use it  diretso 'no  to fill our\nbaked potatoes\n\n\n Ito yung ating  baked potatoes  habang\nmainit siya  you slit  'no  \n\n\nThen you make uh slit like that and then  ang gagawin natin\nipu-  push  natin lalo na pag mainit yan  you have to\npush it  'no  to give it a really an open look  'no\nayan oo  \n\n\nAnd we will fill it with our tuna ayan so  hindi lang\n\n sour cream or butter  'no  you can also use Century\nTuna\n\n\nAnd this is already a complete meal in itself  'no  \n\n\nLet 's put that in our you can put parsley  'no  you\ncan put chives on top  'no  \n\n\nThere you go  \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nWe 're going to use of course  yung ating bida  \nthe red label which is your tuna in vegetable oil\n\n\nAnd then of course  meron tayong  uhm rice stick\nnoodles  'no  \n\n\nAnd then it 's a very simple step  eto na yung ating mga\n\n ingredients\n\n\nWhat we have to do is just put them together heating our oil\n\n\n Pag  heat  natin nung  oil we add in\nall the next ingredients\n\n\nSo we have minced garlic okay that 's our garlic right there and\nthen we have shallots  'no  \n\n\n Mas masarap kung  red onion  ano  \nbut white is okay since we 're using fish  naman  \n\n\nAnd then  ito yung ating  chili pepper  'no\n\n the  labuyo  is fine  ano  dried Thai\nor fresh Thai uh chilis  'no  they can they can use that\n\n 'no  \n\n\nAnd then the  patis 'no yung ating  fish sauce\n\n\nA little bit of sugar  'no kasi alam mo yung  Thai\n\n ano siya e  it 's a very nice blend  ano  \nSylvs\n\n\nAnd then we add in our tuna chunks  dalawa ang gamitin natin\n\n \n\n\nWow you can smell the the aroma it 's very very nice\n\n\nSylvs  hindi na kailangang patagalin pa yung uhm luto\n\n because the tuna is uh already a cooked product  'no  \nit 's just putting everything together and then you add in our noodles\n\n 'no  \n\n\n I-  stir fry  natin  \n\n\nThat 's the  patis 'no  \n\n\nWe have a little bit of uh sugar left we mix it with the peanuts\n\n\n Yung natira nating  uhm uh chili and a little bit\nof the  wansoy   ita-  topping  \nnatin yan  \n\n\nNow we put in the rest of the  wansoy   'no\n\n or  yung  coriander  natin  Sylvia\n\n 'no  \n\n\nSo this is done already\n\n\n Sandaling-sandali lang siya  Sylvs because the\nnoodles is made from rice  'no  and it cooks very very fast\n\n\nThen  iga-  garnish  natin siya  \nwith  yung ating  uh sugar some cilantro and of course the\npeanuts  'no  \n\n\nIf they want to put uhm  yung  uhm cooked eggs uhm\nin rice  parang  scrambled egg and then they can put that on\ntop\n\n\nLet 's put the tuna  syempre  and sprinkle\n\n\n Ganyan lang kadali   \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nWe 're going to make uh to show them how to make this really\nwonderful tuna mousse  'no  \n\n\nIt 's a very very simple step  'no  \n\n\nAnd all you need is just two cans of Century Tuna and we 're going\nto use a food processor to come up with a really nice smooth and satiny\n\n na  mousse  'no  \n\n\nSo we just dump you know our uh yeah red label  'no\n\n \n\n\n Ang ginagamit natin  Sylvia is the chunks in water\n\n\nOkay so we need two cans of Century Tuna chunks in water, okay\n\n\nAnd then we have sour cream okay this is sour cream\n\n\n Imi-  mix  lang natin 'yan  all\ntogether\n\n\nAnd then we have a little bit of mayonnaise  'no  \nthis much mayonnaise this is about fourth of a cup yes\n\n\nAnd green  onions  'no  green or spring\nonions  'yan hahalo-halo natin  \n\n\nAnd then we add in our salt  wala siyang  pepper uh\nbecause of the chives we have the chives already\n\n\nAnd we pass it and process it  dito sa ating  \n\n\" National \" food processor\n\n\nThis is uh your unflavored gelatin yes dispersed in water and then\nuh over low fire  ho  or you could put it in the microwave\noven for one minute\n\n\nYes so  habang umaandar yung ating  we will add our\ngelatin\n\n\nThe gelatin will help it stabilize  'no  \n\n\nUh we have a fish mold here\n\n\nYou can buy this in the supermarket or even in the  \n\n sa ano sa  home home section  'no sa  \nhouseware section  ng mga  supermarket yeah\n\n\nLightly oil  'no  lightly  lang 'no  \n\n\n Ayan  and  ayun  you can this is a\nspout  'no  we can pour it  kung ano yung  \ndesired mold  nila  \n\n\nI just put this uh fish because we we 're  ano  we 're\ndoing uh tuna  'no  \n\n\nAnd  hindi natin pupunuin para  we can still shake\nit  para  there 's a leeway to shake it yeah\n\n\nAnd uh put it in the chiller for about an hour  'no\n\n \n\n\nAnd then  pag nag ano na ho siya nag nag-  set\n\n na mate-  test  mo yung pag  set when you\nshake it it doesn't quiver and it doesn't uh move a lot anymore  'no\n\n it just quivers\n\n\nAnd then  idi-  dip  lang nila yun sa\n\n warm water and then invert it into your serving  platter\nand it comes out like this yes\n\n\nThese are uh the suggested uh sidings for your uh tuna mousse\n\n 'no  \n\n\nSo we have crackers  huwag yung masyadong maalat na\n\n crackers  'no  \n\n\nUh if ever  yung mga  melba toast or water biscuits\n\n 'no  \n\n\nAnd then you put something that would  establish\nfreshness  'no

{"text": "<$A> \n\n\nVery pleasant afternoon to everyone ladies and gentlemen\n\n\nUh how are you today, \n\n\nFine okay I understand it 's a very exciting week  'no   culminating week of your Science Week\n\n\nIs that right\n\n\nYeah first of all can I ask uh are most of you in what what colleges do you come from\n\n\nPolitical Science come again Engineering Liberal Arts Computer uh-huh Commerce anyone from Commerce\n\n\nRight okay so this is actually a diverse group  'no  \n\n\nSo at least I know who I am addressing\n\n\nAnyway I 'd like to thank uh Bing for that very warm introduction and I 'd like to thank your placement office for accepting our uhm talk for this afternoon\n\n\nSo uh I 'm Ms Gail Martinez and uh I am from the Cora Doloroso Espa&ntilde;a branch\n\n\nUh perhaps uh we were thinking of either passing around something but we felt that it 's not necessary like uh you know like a brochure\n\n\nBut I 'm sure you 're quite uh knowledgeable about locations you know\n\n\nSo our school is located along Espa&ntilde;a in front of U S T\n\n\nYou heard of U S T\n\n\nSo we are just right across the U S T campus on Espa&ntilde;a\n\n\nThe reason uh we are here uh my companion is actually Mr Janus Ligpit he 's our staff and he 'll be assisting me later\n\n\nBut uh the reason why we are here is uh for those of you who have not heard so much of our school is to be able to sort of orient you and enlighten you rather on how personality development can really be a very very basic ingredient in the success of one 's career as well as just day-to-day living  'no  \n\n\nUhm I 'm sure you have a basic understanding of what is personality right\n\n\nCan I just ask the lady in stripe red\n\n\nCan I ask just because there has to be some participation otherwise you 'd fall asleep\n\n\nSo my talk will not just be a lecture\n\n\nIt will actually be a demonstration lecture and visual presentation so that you don't knock out on me  \n\n\nSo Ms Lady in red and white you are in college\n\n\nI 'm sure you have gone through how many sixteen years of your you know  \n\n\nAnyway can you possibly tell us uhm in your own words what is personality to you  \n\n\nQuite right okay\n\n\nUh gentleman in red\n\n\n Mahilig ako sa  red  ngayon  okay\n\n\nI 'd like to just spot pick on people\n\n\nWhat is personality to you\n\n\nTo the lady it 's the totality of a person\n\n\nYou  \n\n\nSelf-essence okay\n\n\nSo the essence of all your qualities and that comes out in the way you do things\n\n\nSo let me just give you a brief summary to capture uh to capsulize the meaning\n\n\nSo personality may be defined as the sum total of the quality and characteristics of a person as shown in her manner of walking talking dressing attitude interests and ways of reacting to people and situations \n\n\nThat shows your personality as a whole\n\n\nPersonality is also not just that but uh it can be also the physical emotional intellectual and spiritual dimensions of a person right\n\n\nSo it also goes deeper than what people see\n\n\nAll of you now are in college\n\n\nI would think most of you are eighteen nineteen twenty years old right\n\n\nDid I miss any age did I overshoot underage or what\n\n\nBut anyway at this point  'no  you are going through a transition from being teenagers to coming into the real world of professionals right\n\n\nYou are in  preparing yourselves to become professionals in the world as what De La Salle the De La Salle mission states that you know to come up with whole persons right\n\n\nAnd to be a whole person it 's not it 's not enough that you are knowledgeable here but your knowledge should also be more complete and whole in the development of your characteristics your personality\n\n\nYou may be very good in academics very good but if you 're very well uh weak let 's say so your strong points may be the academic but your weak points are in personal relations and dealings with people uh be they professors or boys and girls or whoever then I wouldn't think you 're successful\n\n\nYou are not successful I 'm I have to say this straight to you\n\n\nA successful person according to research in Harvard is that eighty-five percent of their success is attributed to their attitude and personality\n\n\nFifteen percent is to their what they know\n\n\nBecause you may have a lot of things in your head but you don't know how to go about it in life and deal with people you cannot communicate your ideas\n\n\nYou just know it here and you just stick to yourself then you are not what you call \" a whole person \" and what De La Salle wants is a whole person\n\n\nSo personality plays an important role\n\n\nI for one am a graduate of De La Salle in Mass Com and Psychology but I lived abroad for seven years I worked there and I learned so much about life and ups and downs\n\n\nBut because of that learning process I found out that it 's not how much you know but it 's more on your dealings with people\n\n\nBut don't take me wrong\n\n\nIt 's good to be academically excellent no problem about that\n\n\nNo doubt about that\n\n\nBut coupled with personality you will make it big out there okay\n\n\nAnd don't forget Him of course  'no  okay\n\n\nSo uh let us assess now\n\n\nYou are teenagers going into your twenties\n\n\nI was once yours at your stage and boy it was really adjustment  'no kasi  like I was in a  girls school all my life\n\n\nThen when I got to La Salle we were only twenty-five percent female of the whole population\n\n\n Buti  you you are now fifty percent of the population or more\n\n\nMore  'no  okay so you 're very uh blessed with that\n\n\nSo I 'd like to demonstrate to you a few things\n\n\nHow personality can really help you in your dealings day-to-day\n\n\nIt will be a practical thing alright because when you start working ladies and gentlemen it 's good that the interviewer who interviews you on the job sees your academic potentials\n\n\nBut when it comes to actual emanation of you know your personality he sees you lacking in some things then he would have to you know uh assess you more if he should choose another one\n\n\nBecause granted there was a secretary I knew she was good at typing steno computer but she was so quiet and so you know to herself that a new person came in the office who didn't type as fast who didn't steno as fast and who was poor in computer but because she was so lively and very good in communicating she got a job that was she was promoted faster than the secretary with skills\n\n\nThat 's just a very solid example\n\n\nAlright one of the courses we teach in Cora Doloroso is, I 'll write on the board, \n\n\n\" Savvy Skills \" is for women it can be for men\n\n\nWe call it \" Personal Development \" for men but Savvy Skills deals with a total personality which deals with what poise etiquette\n\n\nWhat is etiquette\n\n\nManners okay\n\n\nAt least that much you can tell me uh personal relations\n\n\nFor the ladies make-up and skin care 'cause when you start working you are not to go to the office with a blank face\n\n\nYou have to put on something color to look uh professionally groomed so to speak\n\n\nGrooming is a very important subject\n\n\nSo I used to teach grooming last year to the ORIENT three   'no  okay ORIENT two three okay\n\n\nSo grooming uhm entertaining is one of our subjects because you socialize and you have to learn the interactions okay\n\n\nThen personal relations even selection of wines is included so that you 're not gonna be caught oh oh I don't know how to select wines oh oh I 'll think I 'll order a Coke oh oh uh things like that  'no  \n\n\nSo at least you are knowledgeable even if you don't drink you know what I mean\n\n\nYou don't drink but you have to order something that sounds alcoholic so you don't look so  neneng-neneng  you know\n\n\nSo for example uhm uh there 's a drink called \" rum cola \" \n\n\nYou 've heard that  'no  \n\n\nRum cola there 's rum and there 's cola\n\n\nSeventy-five percent of it is rum  e  Coke I 'm sorry one uh twenty-five percent is rum\n\n\nSo now you can tell the waiter I 'll order a rum cola but less on the rum or something like that okay\n\n\nSo it 's like you 're ordering really an alcoholic drink but you 're removing the rum in turn you have Coke right\n\n\nOkay so there 's just so much for you to learn in order to be socially adaptable to different people right okay\n\n\nSo what else\n\n\nSo wine selection\n\n\nCan I have a brochure please  kasi  uh when I face all of you you know I get wow\n\n\nOkay so next we have conversational abilities is one of them\n\n\n Kasi  it 's good that you can communicate to all levels of people be they managers you know be they drivers or servants or you know uh officemates you know things like that\n\n\nAnd then culture updates\n\n\nSo culture update is more on appreciation of art and music now and the present\n\n\nSo you 're not totally out of touch  'no  with what 's going on okay\n\n\nThen uh, poise is one\n\n\nSo practically uh ten subject matters\n\n\nSo now I am going to demonstrate a little bit  naman 'no  so a little showmanship of how to walk for the ladies  \n\n\nOkay I told you this is a variety show but the only thing I 'm not going to sing  'no  that 's one thing I 'm still practicing\n\n\nSo for the ladies how will I do this you know where\n\n\nUhm I would have to walk this way then I 'll just try walking this way\n\n\nUh I don't know how far you can see me\n\n\nThe ladies on this side can you see me at this point\n\n\nAnd the men\n\n\nLater on I 'll go to that side as much as possible you could try to stretch your neck down\n\n\nSo ladies  'no  in general we are very normal amphibians amphibians  ba tayo  \n\n\nYeah so when we walk it 's just a normal pacing of walking\n\n\nSo I would assume a normal walk for us generally speaking will be like this  'no   okay\n\n\nYou may not know it but these are the subtleties of personality development\n\n\nWhat would be the way how would be the way we teach it at Cora Doloroso\n\n\nYou see this line\n\n\nThat line okay\n\n\nThe line would indicate that you are to walk in a straight line with one foot in front of the other but don't make it in such a point that you 're like walking on a tight rope on a circus string  'no  \n\n\nNo no no that doesn't mean that\n\n\nIt means you have an imaginary line wherein your feet are no longer parallel but your feet are going alignment in front of the other\n\n\nNow pretend you 're in a palace and you 're walking through the palace floor you know or in a  or in a park\n\n\nSo you would have to walk this way\n\n\nSo right left right left and you make a turn\n\n\nTurn right left right left and then turn\n\n\nYou do it in a way that is smooth  'no  \n\n\n Hindi 'yung   C A T  na 'yan 'no gano'n   \n\n\nWhat we mean is be very natural\n\n\nSo when you start working even now when you 're walking through the campus and the guys are all watching everybody watching you so at least  naman  you have some kind of gait  'no  okay\n\n\nNow this is preferable if you wear one inch heels  kasi  I notice we are now  most girls are wearing  shoes and flat shoes\n\n\nWell never the mind as you uh start progressing into the professional world you 'd have to practice wearing heels\n\n\nAnd we teach you to wear heels in offices whatever offices you go into at least one and a half inches\n\n\nDon't wear flats\n\n\nYou 'd look like an ordinary clerk\n\n\nYou see that is part of personality\n\n\nYou wear one and a half\n\n\nOkay that 's part of wardrobe okay\n\n\nFor the men you don't walk in a straight line okay  \n\n\nMen don't walk in a straight line thank goodness otherwise okay you just walk in the normal  'yon  okay\n\n\nSo boys have no problem\n\n\nSo that 's savvy\n\n\nOkay next I would like to demonstrate also uh, okay how to carry a shoulder bag\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nCan I borrow a bag please does uh anyone okay\n\n\nYou know this is a very practical very practical lecture\n\n\nI don't lecture to make you sleep because that 's not the point of it all\n\n\nBut I have to show you techniques to show how important these all are\n\n\nOkay\n\n\nLet 's say you 're going shopping somewhere or going to a certain place where you know there are lots of uh  mandurukot  you know  kasi  we sometimes have to go to places like Recto or Tondo or Divisoria or whatever uh places that you know are where these people abound  'no  \n\n\nSo what you do is you place uh well let 's first go to Makati\n\n\nOkay first I want to show the difference  or Galleria\n\n\nSo for the men no problem because normally you don't carry much like a clutch bag or something is normal  'no  \n\n\nBut for the ladies well as usual  marami tayong bitbit 'no  \n\n\nOkay, okay so if possible we could carry a briefcase with all our stuff\n\n\nBut for places that are safe no need to fear\n\n\nKeep your bag at the side and you just walk  in a swinging manner okay\n\n\nFor places that are you know uhm full of uh  mandurukots  I believe you should place your three fingers okay three fingers at the handle this way and place it right in front of your okay okay lap here okay and then just walk okay\n\n\nNow it might make you feel well at least poised  ka rin kahit natatakot kang madukutan 'no", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c8d6a339-36df-4d97-8aee-9e5a472cd7e7", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.235440+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nIf Your Honors please uh we received at uh one thirty-five uh\nthis afternoon a copy of the comment opposition to motion to quash filed by\nthe prosecution\n\n\nWe note in this comment which the prosecution has filed that they do\nnot dispute the facts on the basis of which the motion to quash is predicated\n\n\nI shall therefore no longer deal with the facts and proceed, to\ndeal with the arguments\n\n\nThe motion to quash uh is based on no less than the Constitution\nitself particularly Article eleven entitled \" Accountability of\nPublic Officers \" \n\n\nUnder Article eleven Section three Subparagraph six  The\nSenate shall have the sole power to try and decide all cases of impeachment\n\n \n\n\nWhen is there a case of impeachment\n\n\nThere is a case of impeachment when pursuant to Section three\nSubparagraph one  The House of Representatives exercises its exclusive\npower to initiate a case of impeachment  \n\n\nThe Senate would have no jurisdiction to deal with a matter of\nimpeachment unless the impeachment case comes to the Senate from the House of\nRepresentatives which under Section three Subparagraph one has  the\nexclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment  \n\n\nSo now if Your Honors please I shall deal with the power of the\nHouse of Representatives\n\n\nThe Constitution itself provides as to how the House of\nRepresentatives may exercise its exclusive power to initiate a case of\nimpeachment\n\n\nThis is described and provided for in Subparagraphs two three and\nfour of Section three Article eleven\n\n\nLet me first deal with our first ground if Your Honors please that\nthe House of Representatives has not initiated a case of impeachment and that\nthe case of impeachment now before the Senate was not initiated by the House\nof representatives\n\n\nAs I have stated if Your Honors please Section three Paragraph one\nsays \" the House of Representatives \" \n\n\nIt does not say one-third of the members of the House of\nRepresentatives\n\n\nIt says  The House of Representatives shall have the\nexclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment  \n\n\nThe case of impeachment before the Senate was not forwarded to the\nSenate by the House of Representatives\n\n\nI have looked at transmissions of bills approved by the House of\nRepresentatives for concurrence of the Senate\n\n\nThey are sent by the Secretary-General and the Secretary-General\nexplicitly states in his letter of transmission that he does so upon\ninstruction of the House of Representatives\n\n\nThe case of impeachment now before the Senate if Your Honors please\nand we have appended as Annex A of our motion to quash the Journal of the\nHouse of Representatives of November thirteen two thousand\n\n\n The meeting was called to order the National Anthem was\nsung the Speaker read a prayer and immediately he made a manifestation the\nentire manifestation consisting of a reading of the report of the Committee\non Justice to the House on the verified complaint for impeachment against His\nExcellency President Joseph Ejercito Estrada  \n\n\nThere were some attempts on the part of members of the House to\nraise point of order but they were ignored by the Speaker\n\n\nHe continued uh to read simply the report of the Committee on the\nJudiciary and I call your attention particularly to this portion of the\nreport and this is quoted at page six of our motion the second full paragraph\nand I quote  Likewise upon motion which was unanimously approved the\nbody resolved to refer to the plenary for further appropriate action the\nverified complaint and the verified resolutions of endorsement of\nseventy-seven members of the House filed by them apparently in line with the\n\n<unclear> 2 words </unclear>  etcetera  \n\n\nI emphasize if Your Honors please that what the Committee on the\nJudiciary approved was to refer to the plenary not to the Speaker to refer to\nthe plenary for further appropriate action the verified complaint and the\nverified resolutions of endorsement\n\n\nOf course if Your Honors please at the conclusion of the report it\nsays  accordingly the impeachment complaint which shall constitute the\narticles of impeachment together with the verified resolutions of endorsement\nare hereby forwarded to the Speaker  \n\n\nThis obviously Your Honors please is not a pronouncement of the\nCommittee on the Judiciary\n\n\nThis perhaps was a statement of the chairman of the Committee on\nthe Judiciary\n\n\nAnd if you are to read this and relate this to the portions of the\nreport of the judiciary I have read this would mean that the matter is\nreferred to the plenary through the Speaker for further appropriate action\n\n\nNow, after reading the report of the Committee on the Judiciary\nSpeaker Villar simply said and this is I 'm reading from the Journal  \nSpeaker Villar thereafter manifested that since the Constitution mandates\nthat when at least one-third of all the members of the House files a verified\ncomplaint or a resolution of impeachment the same shall constitute the\narticles of impeachment\n\n\n And the duty of the House becomes peremptory and ministerial to\nendorse it to the Senate for trial in the same manner as an approved bill\n\n\nAccordingly the Speaker directed the Secretary-General to\nimmediately transmit to the Senate the impeachment complaint constituting the\narticles of impeachment together with the verified resolutions of endorsement\n\n  \n\n\nYou will note if Your Honors please that even Speaker Villar spoke\nof the duty of the House not the duty of the Speaker but the duty of the\nHouse whether peremptory whether ministerial or by whatever way you describe\nit\n\n\nThe power and to Speaker Villar the duty was vested is vested by\nthe Constitution in the House of Representatives and not in the Speaker\n\n\nSo then it may be asked but what could the House have done\n\n\nOne-third is just a matter of counting numbers\n\n\nThere can be no dispute about that\n\n\nPerhaps none but even the counting of the number is a\nresponsibility of the House and not a responsibility of the Speaker\n\n\nBut apart from that and perhaps even more substantial I would\nconcede that Speaker Villar would have no difficulty counting whether there\nis one-third but perhaps he would have had trouble determining whether the\ncomplaint and the resolutions were verified\n\n\nIf these were submitted to the House questions would have been\nraised as in fact these questions were manifested in a subsequent session of\nthe House of Representatives as to the adequacy of the verification which\nappeared in the resolutions appended to the complaint\n\n\nSo it is clear the House took no action on the complaint and the\nresolutions\n\n\nSpeaker Villar merely acted as a post office transmitting it to the\nSenate\n\n\nBut the Constitution requires that even if Speaker Villar were to\nbe a post office the stamp had to be placed there not by Speaker Villar but\nby authority of the House of Representatives\n\n\nThat is our first ground if Your Honors please\n\n\nThat is why it is our submission that the case before the Senate is\nnot a case of impeachment over which the Senate may exercise jurisdiction\nsimply because it has it did not come to the Senate by virtue of the exercise\nthe exclusive the exercise of the exclusive power to impeach of the House of\nRepresentatives\n\n\nNow we now go to the second ground\n\n\nWhile Section three Subparagraph one speaks of the House of\nRepresentatives having the exclusive power to initiate all cases of\nimpeachment Subparagraphs two three and four describe how the House of\nRepresentatives may initiate a case of impeachment\n\n\nIt provides ways that is described in Subparagraph two and that\nwhich is described in Subparagraph four\n\n\nIt is our submission well that what is before the Senate has come\npurportedly pursuant to Section three Paragraph four which provides  \nIn case the verified complaint or resolution of impeachment is filed by at\nleast one-third of all the members of the House the same shall constitute the\narticles of impeachment and trial by the Senate shall proceed forthwith\nproceed  \n\n\nWe emphasize if Your Honors please that firstly the complaint or\nresolution must be verified and secondly that it must be filed by at least\none-third of all the members of the House\n\n\nIt 's not disputed that the complaint  now before the\nSenate was not filed by one-third\n\n\nThe number of representatives who endorsed amounted to more than\none-third because of resolutions of endorsement which were appended or added\nto the original endorsers that is after October twelve two thousand\n\n\nThe complaint was originally endorsed only by thirty-eight\nrepresentatives\n\n\nBut on November six two thousand the Committee on Justice took note\nthat there were now seventy-seven representatives\n\n\nSo it is not disputed that the complaint was not filed by at least\none-third\n\n\nThe more important requirement in our view is the requirement that\nthe complaint or resolution be verified\n\n\nIt is our submission that this requirement is substantial in nature\nand may not be dispensed with\n\n\nLet us recall that under Section three Subparagraph two which is\nanother mode of initiating a case of impeachment before the House of\nRepresentatives not now by at least one-third but possibly by a complaint by\na private citizen which is endorsed by any member of the House\n\n\nWhat is significant up under Section three  \nSubparagraph two is that after the complaint is filed it 's ceasing it is\nrequired to be included in the order of business within ten session days and\nthen this is the more important part  and referred to the proper\ncommittee within three session days thereafter  \n\n\nThe Committee the Constitution provides the Committee after hearing\nand by majority of all its members shall submit its report to the House\n\n etcetera  \n\n\nFor what purpose does the Committee conduct a hearing\n\n\nWell the  the rules of the House are clear\n\n\nThis hearing under its Rule three entitled \" Finding a\nProbable Cause \" the hearing is conducted to determine whether there\nis probable cause\n\n\nEvidence is received by the Committee for the complainant as well\nas evidence for the respondent\n\n\nThe Committee will then determine will then evaluate the evidence\nand determine whether there is probable cause\n\n\nAnd after having determined whether there is probable cause the\nmatter is then submitted through a report of the Committee to the House for a\nvote\n\n\nWe emphasize this because under Subparagraph four where at least\none-third of the members of the House file a complaint for impeachment the\nhearing is dispensed with\n\n\nIn other words evidence is not received\n\n\nThere is no determination of probable cause\n\n\nBut in lieu of that the Constitution requires that the complaint be\nverified\n\n\nWhy does the Constitution consider verification of a complaint by\none-third of the members of the House sufficient\n\n\nWhy does the Constitution consider this in lieu of a hearing uh\nadequate to determine probable cause\n\n\nIn our motion we have quoted the provisions of the rules of court\nwhich were then enforced in nineteen eighty-seven when the Constitution was\nuh written and ratified\n\n\nVerification means taking an oath attesting to the truth of the\nallegations of the complaint on the basis of one 's own knowledge\n\n\nOtherwise stated at least one-third of the members of the House\nwould be saying under oath the allegations of facts of the complaint are true\nbecause we know it to be true\n\n\nI would assume therefore I would assume that when one-third of the\nmembers of the House say under oath and under pain of perjury that the\nallegations of the complaint are true that can be accepted in lieu of a\nhearing\n\n\nLet it not be suggested that that would make it difficult for any\ncomplaint of  for impeachment to be passed by the House\n\n\nThere is no difficulty because then if not one-third of the members\nof the House swear under oath that the allegations of the complaint are true\nof their knowledge then you go to the first method and that is refer the\ncomplaint to the Committee on the Judiciary receive evidence and on the basis\nof that evidence determine probable cause  \n\n\nI apologize my attention has been called that in the House it is\ncalled Committee on Justice perhaps it is a more appropriate name than\nJudiciary  \n\n\nNow, what is the verification we find in the complaint and the\nresolutions appended to the complaint which is now before the Senate\n\n\nThe verification reads and I will read the the positive portion\n\n that we have caused the complaint  uh  that the\nallegations therein  that is in the complaint  are true of our\nown knowledge and belief on the basis of our reading and appreciation of\ndocuments and other records pertinent thereto  \n\n\nLet me repeat it  the allegations are true of our own\nknowledge and belief  but the key clause or the key phrase after that\nis this  on the basis of our reading and appreciation of documents and\nother records pertinent thereto  \n\n\nSo whoever signed the verifications to this complaint as well as\nthe resolution did not say this uh the allegations of facts are true of my\nknowledge he says they are true because I believe them to be true on the\nbasis of my reading and appreciation of documents and other records pertinent\nthereto\n\n\nIndeed nobody knows what these records and pertinent records are\nthey are not identified\n\n\nThis we submit is not a verification of fact\n\n\nWhen one speaks of verification in law it is verification of facts\n\n\nThis is not a verification of fact it is a statement of an opinion\nbecause when one says based on my reading and appreciation of documents one\nmakes renders an opinion\n\n\nTwo persons can easily disagree on one how one appreciates a\ndocument\n\n\nAnd now you are talking of seventy-seven persons or even more\n\n\nEach one of them could have had their appreciation of documents\n\n\nAnd these are documents which we are unable even to verify as to\nwhether those appreciations are reasonable enough for them to be accepted\nbecause the documents and the records are not identified\n\n\nSo we then have before the Senate articles of impeachment on the\n\n articles of impeachment on which there has been no finding or\nwarrant of probable cause either by evidence or by the oath of one-third of\nthe members of the House of representatives\n\n\nThat being the case if Your Honors please the complaint before the\nHouse cannot qualify under Section three Subparagraph four of Article eleven\nof the Constitution\n\n\nLet me suggest if Your Honors please why the Constitution perhaps\nrequire this\n\n\nIt will be recalled that under the nineteen thirty-five\nConstitution perhaps uh the Constitution which we have had which was least\nexposed to partisan considerations other than perhaps our desire then to\nbecome independent\n\n\nUnder that Constitution in order that the House of Representatives\nmay impeach an official a vote of two-thirds was required and in order that\nthe Senate may convict a three-fourths vote was required\n\n\nThis requirement has been relaxed", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nUhm, with the permission of the Chief Justice distinguished\nSenators we filed our opposition only at about one thirty this afternoon\nbecause truth to tell we could not make out what the President 's counsel\nmeant when they filed the motion to quash\n\n\nWe felt that they were trying to convert the proceedings into a\ncriminal proceeding by giving it the title of a motion to quash which is, \nin a criminal proceeding\n\n\nAnd the Senate rules, does not have any provision on a motion to\ndismiss or to quash\n\n\nIn for interlocutory motions then there 's rules of Court are  \nsuppletory  \n\n\nSo I made a telephone inquiry to the President of the Senate to ask\nhim what would happen this afternoon\n\n\nAnd he said you argue the prosecution  I mean the\nprosecution will argue the defense will argue\n\n\nSo we took it to to mean that there would be a hearing on this\nmotion so we prepared and finalized our  our opposition\n\n\nMr Chief Justice our law professors have told us over and over again\nthat the Constitution speaks of, separation of powers checks and balances\nand coequality\n\n\nThat has been instilled in us\n\n\nThe President would want us to destroy that delicate balance in\nfiling this motion to dismiss\n\n\nWhat is an impeachment process\n\n\nWe agree that the House has the exclusive power to initiate\nimpeachment and the Senate has the sole power to try and decide impeachment\ncases\n\n\nSo you see immediately the distinction\n\n\nWe in the House initiate the Senate decides\n\n\nSo have we initiated\n\n\nYes\n\n\nAnd, if you look closely at the process there 's the magic\nnumber of one-third in both the Senate and in the House\n\n\nIf we get one-third of the members of the House then that one-third\nprevails over the other two-thirds\n\n\nThat is the beauty of this one-third\n\n\nSo let me repeat Mr Chief Justice distinguished members of the\nSenate\n\n\nThis is an instance where the one-third prevails over the\ntwo-thirds and this is what happened\n\n\nAnd in the case of the Senate one-third plus one can block an\nimpeachment\n\n\nSo here 's the magic number of one-third one-third to initiate\none-third plus one for the Senate to block the impeachment\n\n\nThis was placed there for good reason\n\n\nNow what happened\n\n\nThe fact of the matter is that when this started this was started\nby forty-one members of the House short of the seventy-three\n\n\nI myself was not a signatory to the original uhm impeachment\ncomplaint\n\n\nIn my case I wanted steeped in the principle of due process I\nwanted to know whether there was really grounds to impeach the President\n\n\nIn fact if you look at the eleven-member panel here I think half of\nthem were not original signatories\n\n\nAlong the way this was referred to the Committee on Justice\n\n\nBut before the Committee on Justice could hear it, seventy-seven\nhad signed\n\n\nWe reached the magic number of seventy-three and under the\nConstitution once you have seventy-three that impeachment complaint is\ntransmitted to the Senate and trial shall start forthwith\n\n\nNo ifs no buts\n\n\nWhen one-third of the membership of the House says we want to\nimpeach the President no one but no one can stop the House\n\n\nThe one-third speaks for the House and that is exactly what\nhappened\n\n\nBut did we follow the rules\n\n\nYes\n\n\nThere was a committee hearing and in that committee hearing  alright and in that committee hearing\neverybody was heard those against impeachment and those pro\n\n\nBut faced with seventy-seven signatures the opposition collapsed\n\n\nHmh  \n\n\nJust can I have just a little moment\n\n<$B> \n\nWhat 's the pleasure of uh Atty Arroyo\n\n<$A> \n\nI just want to read here the Journal because the President 's\ncounsel have used this as reason\n\n<$B> \n\nThe Journal of\n\n<$A> \n\nJournal of the House of uh November thirteen where it\nreproduces the action taken by the committee\n\n\nIt reads  Likewise upon motion which was unanimously\napproved  unanimous  the body resolved to refer to the plenary\nfor further appropriate action the verified complaint and the verified\nresolutions of endorsement of seventy-seven members of the House filed by\nthem apparently in line with the essence and spirit of Section three\nSubparagraph four of Article eleven of the Constitution of the Philippines\nand Section thirteen of the rules of procedure on impeachment proceedings\n\n \n\n\nSeventy-seven\n\n\nThe committee had no choice\n\n\nThe committee by unanimous vote even against those who were against\nimpeachment said  refer this to plenary  \n\n\nNow what happened\n\n\nMr Chief Justice on November thirteen the Speaker having had the\nreport of the committee incidentally Mr Chief Justice and distinguished\nmembers of the Senate this was not a committee report mind you\n\n\nThis is a report as we understand it in legislation\n\n\nIn legislation we submit a committee report but in impeachment it\nis a mere report\n\n\nWe are not guided by the rules on legislation\n\n\nWe were guided by the rules on impeachment\n\n\nThe House had rules of impeachment in the eighth the ninth the\ntenth and the present eleventh Congress\n\n\nAnd the reason for that is that impeachment complaints were filed\nwith the House\n\n\nThe Senate had no impeachment rules for the simple reason that\nnothing ever reached the Senate except this one\n\n\nNow, just to give our colleagues in the Senate, an idea about\nwhat transpired in the House, \n\n\nWhen the Speaker said that he is transmitting the impeachment\ncomplaint endorsed by seventy-seven members to the Senate he did so as he\nputs it his job was ministerial and peremptory\n\n\nAnd that he transmitted it in line with our own provisions which\nreads,  our own rules, our own\nrules says our own rule says Mr Chief Justice, that a verified\ncomplaint-resolution of impeachment filed by at least one-third of all the\nmembers of the House shall constitute the Articles of Impeachment and in this\ncase the verified complaint-resolution shall be endorsed to the Senate in the\nsame manner as an approved bill of the House\n\n\nAn approved bill of the Senate or of the House means that there 's\nno further thing further action to do\n\n\nAnd what is an approved bill under the rules of the House\n\n\nHere is what is an approved bill  Section eighty-six The\nSecretary-General without need of an express order shall transmit to the\nSenate for its concurrence all bills and joint or concurrent resolutions\napproved by the House or the amendments of the House to bills or resolutions\nof the Senate as the case may be  \n\n\nThe treatment of an impeachment complaint which has been converted\ninto an Articles of eh eh Impeachment is treated as an approved bill and\nbeing an approved bill no further ceremony is necessary\n\n\nIt is administrative in nature and that is exactly what the Senate\ndid no uh what the House did\n\n\nNow Mr Chief Justice perhaps the question would be would uh is\nasked did we verify this\n\n\nYes\n\n\nDid seventy-seven verify this\n\n\nYes\n\n\nThe President 's counsel keeps on repeating and repeating and\nrepeating a verification under the rules of court as understood by the\nSupreme Court\n\n\nSir we are not bound by the rules of court\n\n\nThe House has its own rules\n\n\nWe only listen and obey our own rules and our own rules has its own\nverification and I will read it\n\n\nIt says  Section thirteen of the rules of impeachment The\ncontents of the verification shall be shall be as follows  I quote\n\n We after being sworn in accordance with law depose and state that we\nare the complainants in the above-entitled complaint-resolution of\nimpeachment that we have caused the said complaint-resolution to be prepared\nand have read the contents thereof and that the allegations therein are true\nof our own knowledge and belief on the basis of our reading and appreciation\nof documents and other  records pertinent thereto  \n\n\nMr Chief Justice distinguished Senators this is what we did\n\n\nThat is the verification\n\n\nAnd that is in accordance with our own rules and nobody can\nchallenge our own rules not the Senate not the Supreme Court not anyone\n\n\nNow what are these rules\n\n\nThese rules, we have our rules pursuant to the Constitution\nbecause the Constitution says  Section three Subsection eight on\nimpeachment The Congress shall promulgate its own rules on impeachment to\neffectively carry out the purpose of this section  \n\n\nWe did just that\n\n\nWe have our own rules\n\n\nAnd our own rules say what I have read and that we followed\n\n\nBut the President 's counsel tells us we should follow the rules of\ncourt\n\n\nNo Sir we don't\n\n\nWe cannot be bound because insofar as the House is concerned we are\nsupreme within our own sphere\n\n\nSo what is the next question\n\n\nOn the question of verification and, could there be\nirregularities\n\n\nMr Chief Justice distinguished Senators on the day November\nthirteen you had your reorganization we had our

{"text": "<$A> \n\n \nMr Chief Justice Your Your Honors please, I 've never given much importance to an oath but all of us have taken our oaths\n\n\nOur Chair Congressman Belmonte has read the oath but I will read the oath again of the President, because it 's only now that I realize what this oath is all about\n\n\nWhen  when Joseph Ejercito Estrada took his oath high noon of June thirty nineteen ninety-eight he said  I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully and conscientiously fulfill my duties as President of the Philippines preserve and defend its Constitution execute its laws give justice to every man and consecrate   \n\n\nIn nineteen ninety-eight he promised the province of Ilocos Sur that he would release the monies that were  withheld by President Ramos\n\n\nThen on June twenty-seven July twenty-seven nineteen ninety-eight when all of us listened to his State of the Nation Address he said that the nation is bankrupt, \n\n\nBut then here comes Governor Singson and tells the President Mr President could you make good the promise you gave to the people of Ilocos Sur \n\n\nThe President said yes \n\n\nBut he gave a condition\n\n\nWhat was that\n\n\nHe said that fifteen percent of all those monies that he would send to Ilocos Sur should go to him\n\n\nNow this was barely a month one and a half months after he took his oath and after he declared that the government was bankrupt\n\n\nBut he provided money for Ilocos Sur\n\n\nSo sometime in August he released through the budget two hundred million for Ilocos Sur\n\n Well and good\n\n\nBut then comes Atong Ang Presidential adviser and tells the President and tells Governor Singson the President wants one hundred thirty million of the two hundred million \n\n\nSingson asked why \n\n\nHe gave only two hundred why should I give one hundred thirty \n\n\nAtong Ang says that is the partial one hundred thirty\n\n\nYou will get some more \n\n\nSo it is on that basis that, that prosecution will detail how the highest and supposedly the most exalted official of our nation systematically diverted the people 's money to himself and his family\n\n\nAnd we will show how it was what transpired \n\n pocket was a planned and swiftly executed maneuver\n\n\nIn fact the transaction was completed in less than three days\n\n\nThree individuals Delia Rajas Eleuterio Tan and Alma Alfaro acted as fronts and dummies\n\n\nThey conspired with Atong Ang who was acting on the President 's behalf to divert to Mr Estrada one hundred thirty million originally intended to alleviate the plight of tobacco farmers of Ilocos Sur\n\n\nThe manner in which these individuals accomplished was truly ingenious\n\n\nLet 's start the first day\n\n\nThursday August twenty-seven nineteen ninety-eight check number zero nine six seven five zero for the amount of one hundred seventy million for the cash advance approved by the Provincial Board was released to Governor Singson\n\n\nGovernor Singson authorized members of his staff Maricar Paz and  Marina Atendido to represent him in transactions with the Vigan branch of the Land Bank of the Philippines\n\n\nFrom the one hundred and seventy million forty million went to the curing barn bar supplier while the one hundred thirty legitimate forty million while the one hundred thirty million that Atong asked went to the President and his family\n\n\nYou may ask why\n\n\nHow was this done\n\n\nGovernor Singson instructed the Land Bank Vigan to remit to Land Bank Shaw Boulevard fifty million for the account of Delia Rajas forty million for the account of Eleuterio Tan forty million for the account of Alma Alfaro\n\n\nYou ask the question\n\n\nHow in the world can these private individuals become uh-uh should open accounts of public funds\n\n\nThey 're private individuals, no connection with the government no connection with the tobacco industry but accounts were opened already on their behalf\n\n\nNow with undue haste Alma Alfaro tried to withdraw the forty million in cash on the same day or on August twenty seven nineteen ninety-eight but since the bank did not have the cash she was advised to go back the following day twenty-eight August\n\n\nAlfaro returned on that day and withdrew the forty million in cash at around ten A M\n\n\nRemember the forty million that 's already cash\n\n\nOn August twenty-eight a Friday with extreme haste Eleuterio Tan withdrew the forty million\n\n\nWith indecent haste Delia Rajas also withdrew the fifty million\n\n\nThen with the ninety million forty plus fifty-three cashier 's checks were purchased from Land Bank Shaw Boulevard payable to Eleuterio Tan\n\n\nStrange as it may seem on the same day August twenty-eight nineteen ninety-nine another person using the same name Eleuterio Tan opened a savings account this time with another bank Westmont Bank Mandaluyong branch under savings account number two zero one one zero zero seven seven two dash seven\n\n\nWhat must be emphasized if Your Honors please is that these two Eleuterio Tans had two different faces two different dates of birth two different addresses and two different specimen signatures\n\n\nYet Eleuterio Tan number two had in his possession the same three cashier 's checks  purchased by Eleuterio Tan number one and Delia Rajas\n\n\nSo here is the money trail of what was originally public funds already messed up into private funds\n\n\nThe next day Saturday and Sunday  sana  no transactions\n\n\nThe third working day August thirty-one Monday Eleuterio Tan number two deposited in his Westmont Bank Mandaluyong branch savings account the three cashier 's checks totaling ninety million which came came from Eleuterio Tan number one\n\n\nThe deposit was made at nine fifty-two A M\n\n\nFor those around they could see the money trail clearly it 's all there\n\n\nOn the same day in an unprecedented banking transaction the three cashier 's checks were encashed and the money was withdrawn from the Westmont Bank Mandaluyong branch\n\n\nThese withdrawals were as follows twenty million at twelve thirty-two P M forty million at one fifty-five P M and thirty million at one at two forty-eight P M\n\n\nAll in cold cash\n\n\nAll in uh two hours\n\n\nAfter each withdrawal the money in thick bundles of crisp bills was brought to the nearby house of Atong Ang 's mother in Mandaluyong City where Governor Singson was waiting\n\n\nAtong Ang had even to involve his mother in this kind of transaction\n\n\nThe brazen manner in which the President finally took custody of these public funds shows the depths of shame and disgrace to which that office has fallen\n\n\nThe prosecution will prove that from the house of Atong Ang 's mother Governor Singson together with the President 's intermediary Atong Ang brought the crispy bills totaling one hundred thirty million the ninety million withdrawn from Westmont Bank the forty million earlier drawn by Alma Alfaro from Land Bank Shaw Boulevard directly to the President 's home in one Polk Street North Greenhills\n\n\nAt this juncture Your Honors please this one hundred thirty million is different from what Congressman uh Apostol said that 's  jueteng  money\n\n\nThis one is tobacco money and these are public funds\n\n\nThat 's why the seriousness of this how public funds, got into the pocket of the President is something we we would request you to ponder very carefully\n\n\nAfter all both Governor Singson and Mr Ang were close friends of the President and could be trusted to be complicit partners in this transaction\n\n\nGovernor Singson will reveal in detail what happened at the President 's house\n\n\nHe will narrate how Mr Estrada scolded Atong Ang for giving part of the money to the First Lady and Presidential son Jinggoy Estrada\n\n\nGovernor Singson will narrate how the President also berated Atong Ang for pocketing a portion of the funds for himself without the President 's knowledge and permission\n\n\nGovernor Singson will also tell us that the First Lady even expressed her profound thanks to him for the millions of pesos she received\n\n\nGovernor Singson will give us a first account of how public funds intended to alleviate the living conditions of our needy tobacco farmers in Ilocos Sur instead found their way into the pocket of a greedy President\n\n\nThis creative and bald-faced manner of diverting cash shows how the people 's money could be easily stolen\n\n\nIt couldn't be done no way unless they 've been under the instruction and under the auspices of the Office of the President\n\n\nThe amount is just so big, and the transaction so fast\n\n\nIn three days public funds were converted into private funds\n\n\nIn three days they were in from Vigan\n\n\nIn three days they were in the pocket of the President of the Philippines\n\n\nBy authorizing the release of public funds with the clear and deliberate intention of ultimately appropriating these amounts for himself the President must account to the people he has sworn to serve and protect\n\n\nHe is clearly unfit to lead\n\n\nHe must go\n\n\nArticle Two consists of two parts\n\n\nI 'll now proceed to the second part\n\n\nArticle eleven Section seventeen of the nineteen eighty-seven Constitution provides that a public officer or employee shall upon assumption of office and as often thereafter as may be required by law submit a declaration under oath of his assets liabilities and net worth\n\n\nAll of us here did that\n\n\nAll of them did it\n\n\nRepublic Act three zero one nine and six seven one three also require public officers to submit a sworn true and detailed statement of assets and liabilities including a statement of the amounts and sources of his income and financial and business interests\n\n\nOn April twenty-nine nineteen ninety-nine and April twenty-eight two thousand President Joseph E Estrada filed his nineteen ninety-eight and ninety-nine statement of assets and liabilities respectively with disclosing under oath only his wife 's interests and financial connections in three corporations and making it appear that he himself has no interest and financial connection in any company\n\n\nIn the course of the impeachment proceeding we will prove him wrong\n\n\nWe will provide indisputable evidence that President Estrada lied under oath because he deviously concealed his interests and financial connections in the following corporations among others but not limited to  \n\n\nSt Peter, St Peter Holding Company Dex Resources Company Hady States Holdings Company Verdant Resources Company F V C now V F C Wealthy and Development Company Valhalla Resources Company  Gelf  Real Estate and Development Company J E Films and Video One Corporation Erap Youth Erap Youth Muslim Foundation\n\n\nWe will prove that in July nineteen ninety-nine President Estrada through Presidential Counsel Edward  Serapio remember if Your Honors please remember this name because it may keep on recurring\n\n\nIt was it was mentioned by uh Congressman Apostol in the  jueteng  thing now he is also involved here\n\n\nHe is the President 's personal lawyer \n\n Serapio caused the incorporation of St Peter 's Holdings and Dex Resources for the purpose of acquiring real property\n\n\nNow remember this under the Articles of Incorporation each of these corporations have identical stockholders identical directors identical incorporators\n\n\nAll were partners and associates of President Estrada 's personal lawyer Edward Serapio\n\n\nAll the companies also had the same office address the law office of Edward Serapio \n\n\nIn addition they have the same authorized capital of one million and a mere paid-up capital of sixty-two thousand five hundred pesos\n\n\nRemember this, paid-up capital of sixty-two thousand five hundred\n\n\nWe shall prove that on October one nineteen ninety-nine Jose Luis Yulo again remember this name a close friend of the President acquired all but four qualifying shares in St Peter 's Holdings and caused the increase in the paid-up capital of the corporation to two hundred fifty thousand\n\n\nThen as evident in a deed of sale dated October one nineteen ninety-nine which we 'll show in the impeachment proceeding St Peter 's Holdings purchased from Vicente and Gerardo Madrigal a seven thousand one hundred forty-nine square meter property in New Manila otherwise known as Boracay for eighty-six million\n\n\nNow pray tell me how can a corporation with a capital of fifty-two thousand five hundred acquire a property worth, eighty-six million\n\n\nBy no stretch of imagination can Serapio ever say or even Jose Yulo say that, he capitalizes or his corporation has a paid-in capital of sixty-two thousand five hundred and he can buy a property from the Madrigals for eighty-six million\n\n\nNow we shall also prove that St Peter 's Holding paid the eighty-six million with a B P I cashier 's check and more which St Peter 's Holdings purchased using funds from his newly opened account in B P I\n\n\nWe shall show that St Peter 's account was funded from Jose Luis Yulo 's personal account in B P I and that Jose Luis Yulo 's account personal account in B P I, turned was in turn funded with check number zero one one zero seven one four nine five one issued by a person whose signature appears on the screen, \n\n\nWe want you to see this signature\n\n\nStudy very closely\n\n\nYou 'll notice look at the lower portion which has an arrow\n\n\nLook at the signature\n\n\nExamine it carefully\n\n\nIt purports\n\n\nThen look at the signature of the President in a five hundred peso bill which is on top\n\n\nYou need not be an expert to see the similarity\n\n\nThe name may be different but there are unmistakable signs that, the signature in that check is the signature of the handwriting of the President of the Philippines", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThank you Mr Chief Justice\n\n\nMr Chief Justice I 'll be very very brief\n\n\nI uh feel when I 'm standing in this chamber this evening that uh I 'm\nactually facing the bar of history and the bar of public opinion\n\n\nThere is a certain amount of  trepidation in my heart\n\n\nBut nonetheless I must perform my duty, as I must being a member\nof this chamber\n\n\nMr President uh Mr uh Chief Justice I 'm not saying at this point\nthat President Joseph Ejercito Estrada is guilty of the charges against him\n\n\nNeither am I saying that he is innocent not yet\n\n\nWhat I 'm saying at this point and this is the only issue before us\nis that I cannot, as a judge perform the function of the House of\nRepresentatives which has the sole power authority and  \nprerogative to prepare the articles that will impeach, and impeach the\nPresident\n\n\nIf indeed the President of the Philippines committed the alleged\nwrongdoings being imputed to him on the basis of the facts claimed to have\nbeen uncovered by the prosecution after the articles of impeachment have been\nelevated to the Senate then let the House of Representatives perform its\nconstitutional duty to prepare a new set of article or articles of\nimpeachment to embody the newly discovered acts of alleged wrongdoing\n\n\nTo do otherwise Mr uh Chief Justice and ladies and gentlemen of the\nSenate I humbly submit that this Senate acting as an impeachment court has no\npower under the Constitution to amend the articles of impeachment before us\n\n\nIt cannot constitutionally and validly perform the task lodged\nsolely by the Constitution on the House of Representatives\n\n\nTo do that to do so would be a total travesty of due process and a\ntransgression of elementary fairness\n\n\nYou know Mr uh Chief Justice ladies and gentlemen of this chamber\nwe talk of discovering the truth\n\n\nThere are people in this chamber who do not know the meaning of\ntruth\n\n\nOne time and I 'll tell you this I was charged with a crime that\nwas not even in our statute books rebellion complex with murder\n\n\nAnd my witness to the fact that I was innocent and even the\ndistinguished member of the Senate Senator Cayetano knows about this and some\ngentlemen in this chamber know about this\n\n\nMy witness was no less than a priest who was saying Mass in my\nHouse at that very moment when they say that Senator Gringo Honasan then\nColonel Honasan was in my House with one hundred soldiers at that precise\nmoment for which I was framed and jailed with rebellion complex with murder\nin order to immobilize me\n\n\nAnd you know what happened to Father Danilo Dagsan the priest\n\n\nHe was shipped out of this country by no less than Jaime Cardinal\nSin with the connivance and conspiracy of President Corazon Aquino\n\n\nAnd this is the opportune time Mr President Mr Chief Justice for me\nto put this in the annals and record of this Republic so that future\nhistorians will know the entire truth about this\n\n\nThank you  \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nUh thank you Mr Chief Justice\n\n\nThe whole country or maybe perhaps even Filipinos in other\ncountries are listening to us right now and I wonder how many of them think\nlistening to our colleagues that they are listening to a political rally or\nthey are listening to a legal proceeding\n\n\nBecause the nature Mr Chief Justice and my dear colleagues of what\nhas been going on in this chamber for the last month and a half has really\nbeen a, an event uh which has in effect been an arena on two sides\n\n\nOn the one hand you have the political arena and Amado Doronila\ncorrectly observed in a recent column of the Philippine Daily Inquirer that\nthose who are opposed to the continued tenure of President Joseph Ejercito\nEstrada are winning the public opinion battle\n\n\nA very shall we say candid remark\n\n\nBecause he in effect is saying that what is going on is not really\na trial for the impeachment of the President of the Philippines but rather an\neffort to bring down that President not by the constitutional processes that\nwe are actively engaged in but through the bar of public opinion\n\n\nAnd that perhaps Mr President explains why many times in this court\nthere are statements by the prosecution that uh it is making a pro offer it\nis announcing something that it will do to subpoena the records of Citibank\nbecause the President his wife the ladies that he is  said to be\nuh associated with as well as his so-called cronies have accounts in the\nCitibank and immediately the next day almost all the newspapers are\nheadlining President Estrada Mrs  Loi Ejercito Estrada  \netcetera etcetera  have accounts in Citibank as if this was gospel\ntruth\n\n\nThis is of course the arena of public opinion that is being fed by\nunsubstantiated loose remarks coming from the prosecution within this chamber\n\n\nWe are therefore being used Mr President we are being used\n\n\nWe are being made puppets in a show to bring about the completion\nthe success of an agenda that is not provided for in the Constitution and\nthat is what really is the unfortunate thing of what is going on Mr President\n\n\nNow Mr President in this whole effort members of the Senate are\nattacked by the prosecution\n\n\nThere is a scoreboard there right across our very parking lot which\nridicules us and of course those who are perceived to be not following the\ndictates of the mob\n\n\nAnd Mr President we ourselves have turned upon each other and even\nin the lounge where we have our  meriendas  you will not\nyou need not be perceptive to see how the groupings of the senators sitting\nwith each other no longer show the old environment of cordiality that was\npresent here\n\n\n Nagkakampo-kampo na tayo dun sa  dining room\n\n\nThose are the those are the the uh shall we say the heavy burden\nthat we have to bear as the result of what is going on and uh I bewail this\nbecause it is unnecessary\n\n\nAnd it would have been totally different if there had been no\n\n<unclear> 1 word </unclear> T V cameras in this hall it would have been\ntotally different\n\n\nAnd this is the result of all these cameras all over cameras\npeeking on our feet cameras trying to catch us asleep cameras trying to catch\nus talking to each other as if we were supposed to sit here like stupefied\nmummies listening to everything that is going on\n\n\nAnd so Mr President tonight we are here voting on a very simple\nquestion\n\n\nI mean this is a question that a judge in the lower in the Regional\nTrial Court rules on every day\n\n\nThis is a question that justices of the Court of Appeals rule on\n\n\nThe rules are very simple\n\n\nThe rules are very clear\n\n\nThe facts are very clear\n\n\nBut because there is T V around this has become a big spectacle\n\n\nMr President I would like to say that our vote tonight even if some\nof us feel that they are casting their vote on the final judgment is not\nreally a vote on a final judgment\n\n\nAnd the final judgment may or may not follow the result of the\nvoting tonight\n\n\nAnd if there are those I think it would be appropriate to say who\nwant to make a big issue out of this for their own purposes so be it\n\n\nFor me Mr President Mr Chief Justice this is just a simple vote on\na simple procedural issue that is well  uh which is well-defined\nprovided for in the rules of evidence and all the rules that we have been\nfollowing\n\n\nSo in conclusion may I say Mr President and Mr Chief Justice what\nis this fuss all about\n\n\nThank you  \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nMr Chief Justice my colleagues\n\n\nIt is quite unfortunate that my good friend Senator Juan Ponce\nEnrile brought up the issue again an incident of history that happened ten\nyears ago\n\n\nI will not deal at length on that point\n\n\nI would rather just let history and our people decide on the action\nof the players at that time\n\n\nBut let me just state that in nineteen ninety I was placed in a\nsituation where I had to defend the existence of a duly-constituted\ngovernment\n\n\nAnd therefore I invoked the law and the legal processes in order to\nprotect the duly constituted government\n\n\nI did not take extra-legal measures\n\n\nI invoked a decision or the dissenting opinion in a case decided by\nthe Supreme Court\n\n\nWe followed the law\n\n\nWe followed the Constitution\n\n\nLet the people judge our action in history\n\n\nBut having said that Mr President Mr Chief Justice let  \nuh let me now share my position insofar as this matter at issue uh at hand uh\nin issue at hand\n\n\nThe issue here is whether or not envelope or the contents of\nenvelope number two is covered or covered by the articles of impeachment\n\n\nIt is argued that these are not covered by the articles of\nimpeachment and therefore it is immaterial and irrelevant as argued by the\nprosecution  as they have done in the past\n\n\nIn fact Mr Chief Justice the phrase \" irrelevant and\nimmaterial \" would be the most popular phrase these days\n\n\n Pumunta po kayo kahit saang  party  ang\nunang sasabihin sa inyo   Objection your honor on ground that\nit is irrelevant and immaterial  \n\n\n Buong bansa po ay halos abogado na\n\n\nNgunit dito po ngayon ang tanungin natin ito ba'y talaga  \nirrelevant and immaterial\n\n\n Sa akin po kagalang-galang na  Chief Justice\n\n hindi po\n\n\nAng kagalang-galang na  Chief Justice  ay sinabi\nniya doon sa kanyang  extended opinion dated December eighteen\n\n In ordering the opening of the first sealed envelope that the\nobjection based on immateriality would be premature and once the document\nobtained in connection therewith are formally offered in evidence that is the\ntime when objections on materiality can be should be ruled upon  \n\n\nAnd therefore this issue has been ruled upon by the Chief Justice\n\n\n Kaya nga po kangina hinihingi ko kung pupwede ang  \nChief Justice  muna ang siyang mag-husga dito po sa ating\npinag-uusapan\n\n\nDahil ito po  irrelevant and immaterial  ay isang\npatakaran sa husgado\n\n\nAt sino po ang mag-huhusga\n\n\nSino po ang  most qualified to judge on relevance and\nmateriality\n\n\nIt is the Chief Justice\n\n\n Kaya po aking hiniling kangina kung sana ang  Chief\nJustice under the Rule six of our rules would first decide on this\n\n\nUnfortunately that was not possible because of the motion already\nbeen filed\n\n\nHas this been ruled upon by the Chief Justice\n\n\nYes because on January ten two thousand by  by January\nten two thousand one by order of the Chief Justice this document was\nsubpoenaed on June  January ten two thousand one this  \nthis Chief Justice Chief Justice Davide ordered through a subpoena  \nduces tecum ad testificandum  that documents related to savings\naccount number or savings account number zero one six zero six two five o one\ndash five be

na siyang isang sulat\nna ang sabi ni Ocampo pinirmahan ni Pangulong Estrada bilang Jose Velarde ang\nnakalagay doon  \" my savings account zero one six zero six\ntwo five zero one dash five \" \n\n\n Yan po ang sinabi ni Jose Velarde\n\n\nYan po ang sinabi ni Pangulong Aquino ni Pangulong Estrada\n\n\nMaliwanag po na itong  account  na ito ay pag-aari\nni Pangulong Estrada inamin po niya yan\n\n\nKaya po ayaw buksan ng depensa yan  \n\n\nGrounds of relevance and materiality\n\n\nMr Chief Justice my colleagues envelope number two is relevant and\nmaterial in our quest for truth\n\n\nEnvelope number two is relevant and material for the credibility of\nthis proceeding\n\n\n Envelope number two is relevant and material for the\ncredibility of this

monopoly of the truth\nor of the law\n\n\nThat is why we must learn to accept each other 's conviction\n\n\nAnd that is why I intend that together with the rest of my\ncolleagues whom I hope will do likewise I intend to vote out of a sense of\nthe shared destiny of the Filipino people  \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nUh Mr Chief Justice Mr Senate President my distinguished\ncolleagues\n\n\nI was almost disappointed that everything I wanted to say was said\nin more eloquent terms by the Honorable Judge Senator Miriam\nDefensor-Santiago\n\n\nBut I have very little to add\n\n\nUh Mr Chief Justice to me this is all about the rules and following\nthem\n\n\nThe ultimate rule is the Philippine Constitution\n\n\nWhen I rose in rebellion against three Presidents and what I\nperceived then to be corrupt and inefficient governments everybody told me\nthat I had violated the Constitution and my oath of office as a soldier\n\n\nMr President Mr Chief Justice whether we open the envelope the\nsecond envelope or not the truth cannot be suppressed to the Filipino people\n\n\nSo instead of, spending time trying to defend the Constitution I\nthink we should all try to follow it first\n\n\nThank you Mr Chief Justice  \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n Uhm to appeal to my friends and\ncolleagues in fact maybe if we can dispense with this as soon as possible it\nis better\n\n\nBut it 's in the nature of the impeachment process Mr Chief Justice\nthat passions there are passions and I can see the passion of the prosecution\nI can see the passion of the defense\n\n\nAnd sometimes it is uh precisely because there is passion that we\nas lawyers and we as Senators must now rise about above ourselves\n\n\nWhat is at issue Mr Chief Justice at court is an interlocutory\nquestion but what is being judged is not just President Estrada\n\n\nWe are now putting ourselves before the bar of history\n\n\nWe are putting ourselves before the bar of public opinion and our\njudgment on this interlocutory order can therefore affect not just President\nEstrada but the Chamber and this impeachment court\n\n\nI rise consequently Mr Chief Justice to appeal to all of us to try\nto consider the, interests of not only the Chamber as a Senate not only\nthe Chamber as an impeachment court but the, interests and responsibility\nthat we owe to all those who sent us here\n\n\nUnfortunately there is nobody else being given the assignment to\ntry  \n\n\nIf we convict or declare as innocent the respondent President\nEstrada it must be on full transparency  \n\n\nThe fact that we are on trial should make us pause Mr Chief Justice\nand I hope we can achieve some consensus on some points\n\n\n Kung ano man po ang hatol ng  impeachment court\n\n na  to finally  ma-  guilty  ma-\n\n innocent  ang importante suportahan ng mamamayang Pilipino\n\n \n\n\nIt does not it is not as important that it is \" guilty\n\n\" or \" innocent \" it must be supported by the\nFilipino people and the Republic of the Philippines\n\n\nThis evening we seem to be about to cross a bridge and I hope Mr\nChief Justice that when we cross that we retain the higher credibility of the\nimpeachment court and the impeachment process  \n\n\nIn summary because I have less than two minutes I think if I may\nappeal to my colleagues we are the ones now being judged it 's the Chamber\n\n\nAs we vote on this we shall be judged\n\n\nAnd I hope we and I have the highest regard and whenever I 'm asked\nby media I keep saying I have the highest expectations from my colleagues and\nI hope that that expectation will be met and approved and accepted by the\nFilipino people\n\n\nThank you  \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n Chief Justice that this uh matter\nbefore us tonight is the same issue that was before us uh a few weeks ago I\nbelieve uh before Christmas and that was the subject of an extended order uh\nby the Chief Justice by the Presiding Officer dated December eighteen two\nthousand\n\n\nAnd therefore I believe that to be consistent with that ruling then\nthe appropriate thing to do is to allow the opening of the second set of\ndocuments\n\n\nMr Chief Justice our job here is to ferret out the truth\n\n\nThe people deserve nothing less than to know the truth\n\n\n Payagan po nating malaman ng taong bayan ang katotohanan sa\npagbukas po ng pangalawang documento   \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nThank you Mr Chief Justice\n\n\n And since this is only the opening\nof the envelope  at kailangang malaman ng taong bayan kung anong\ntalagang katotohanan palagay ko  Mr Chief Justice we owe it to the\nnation we owe it to the Filipino we owe it to the millions who are now\nlistening to grant this simple request\n\n\n Buksan natin yung sobre upang malaman kung ano talaga ang\nnakalagay diyan  \n\n\nWhy is the defense objecting so vigorously\n\n\n Kung natuloy ba 'yung plano na nabulgar dito na si  \nMr Dichaves  ang may-ari ng  savings account  \nmagkakaroon ba ng  objection  kagaya ng  objection\n\n na hinaharap natin ngayon  \n\n\n Palagay ko hindi magkakaroon ng ganoong  objection\n\n\n Alam na ng bayan  and the people have a right to\nknow we have a right to know\n\n\nAnd in the name of truth in the name of the Filipino in the name of\njustice I ask this envelope be opened now\n\n\nThank you  \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nUh Mr Chief Justice you know tonight the reputation of the\nSenate as an institution is at stake\n\n\nFor the past several weeks starting December seven the practically\nthe whole country has followed the progress of this impeachment trial via\ntelevision or radio or videotapes later on\n\n\nEverybody knows the evidence that has been brought out in this\ntrial whether they were accepted conditionally or absolutely they still know\n\n\nBut what is important to this institution Mr Chief Justice is not\nwhether the final verdict of the Senators will be to convict or to acquit the\nPresident of the Republic\n\n\nWhat is important is that the process was transparent and that the\nverdict is in keeping with the evidence that has been brought out during this\ntrial\n\n\n Pag  overwhelming  po ang  evidence\n\n e anong magagawa natin maa-  acquit  ba yan  \n\n\n E magagalit ang taong bayan sa atin  \n\n\n Pag kulang naman ang ebidensiya  it would be\nridiculous for us to convict His Excellency the President\n\n\n Hayon po noong  December twenty  ba ho 'yon\nbinuksan po natin yung  envelope number one\n\n\n Ang nakasulat ho diyan \" Jose Velarde \" \n\n \n\n\n Wala namang koneksiyon pa kay Pangulong Erap Estrada\n\n \n\n\n Ngunit meron hong  notation  diyan na eto po\nang  the other half of a combo account  at nakasulat po doon\nyung  saving account number  ni Jose Velarde  \n\n\nLater on when Clarissa Ocampo testified that indeed she saw the\nPresident of the Republic sign \" Jose Velarde \" to five sets\nof documents the agency agreement or investment management agreement the\nauthorization to debit his savings account the very same numbered savings\naccount that was in the first set of documents that came out of the first\nenvelope delivered here by Equitable Bank and other documents that was when\nthe connection was made\n\n\nNow the Senate allowed the opening of the first envelope the Senate\nallowed the testimony of Clarissa Ocampo and people found Clarissa Ocampo to\nbe very very credible\n\n\nAfter all she had no reason to lie\n\n\n Ngayon po dito po sa  account that is being hidden\ninside envelope number two the savings account as asserted earlier by\nprosecutor Joker Arroyo contains deposits or will show reported deposits of\nabout three point three billion pesos over a span of twelve months\n\n\n Malamang po nandiyan po yung deposito na galing sa  \ntobacco fund  na sinabi na binanggit ni  Governor  \nChavit Singson na binigay daw niya kay Atong Ang at binigay ni Atong Ang kay\nJoseph Estrada  \n\n\n Paano natin malalaman 'yon  \n\n\n Malamang nandiyan din ho 'yung  two hundred million\n\n na binigay po ni Ricaforte kay Ed Serapio at dineposito daw ni Ed\nSerapio sa isang  Equitable Bank account same bank\n\n\nAs a matter of fact the treasurer of the Erap Muslim Youth\nFoundation is none other than the Chairman of the Board or then Chairman of\nthe Board and majority owner George L Go\n\n\nSo  sa ngayon po  as a member of this impeachment\npanel  ako po'y nagtataka kung bakit po natatakot ang  defense\npanel  na buksan po itong  envelope  na ito  \n\n\n Sapagkat una sa lahat nadinig ko po  and I have\nheard it several times that His Excellency the President said  I have\nnot committed graft and corruption\n\n\nI have not received a single cent from any source that is illegal\n\n \n\n\nAnd when Clarissa Ocampo testified I remember the President said\n\n  wala akong kinalalaman diyan   \n\n\nSo why is the defense panel so afraid to open this\n\n\nOn the other hand  baka pag buksan 'tong  envelope\n\n na ito tapos na yung boksing  \n\n\nAnd that is where we are tonight\n\n\nSo Mr Chief Justice when we took an oath to be members of this\nimpeachment panel we took an oath to render impartial justice\n\n\nAs far as I 'm concerned the one on trial here the President of the\nRepublic is not really the one on trial\n\n\nIt is the Senate that is on trial\n\n\nAnd furthermore the Senate has been conducting this impeachment\ntrial to make sure that society can be saved from anybody who would be\ndeclared unfit for public office\n\n\nSimple question\n\n\nCan a President or any official deposit three point three billion\npesos in his account and still be fit for public office\n\n\nThat 's the question tonight\n\n\nAnd if we vote not to open envelope two and I know that the\ncontents of envelope two will somehow find its way into the newspapers if not\ntomorrow then the day after and the whole country will know what is in\nenvelope two then I think the members of this body will only have themselves\nto blame for trying to make sure that the Filipinos lose on a technicality\n\n\n Pag me na-  technical  ho rito ang taong\nbayan po na-  technical\n\n\nAnd therefore Mr Chief Justice I move that we open the envelope and\neven accept on condition in the same manner that we opened the first envelope\nand we allowed Clarissa Ocampo to testify\n\n\nSo that later on we as members of the impeachment body may decide\nwhether indeed the testimony and the documents were relevant or not\n\n\nThank you Mr Chief Justice", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "588fec32-a8e9-4740-a2fb-23557c1cb3ea", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nAll of these uh issues uh we are to deal with this afternoon uh\nYour Honors, involve uh the jurisdiction of the Senate to try and decide\n, alleged acts of the Respondent not alleged in the Articles of Impeachment\n\n\nThere are subsidiary issues with respect to certain accounts because\nthey are not in the name of the Respondent\n\n\nI will deal with them, at the end of my arguments\n\n\nI have uh distributed if Your Honors please uh a a copy of the\npertinent portions of Article two of the Articles of Impeachment together\nwith uh a, brief statement as to what are the conclusions, therein as\nwell as the allegations of fact\n\n\nThere are two kinds of assets if Your Honors please which are\ninvolved uh in these uh subpoena  duces tecums  as well as\nthe second envelope\n\n\nFirst are the alleged mansions particularly in the case of the\nsecond envelope what has been referred to as the Boracay mansion\n\n\nThe other asset involved are cash assets or their equivalent which\nare, involved in all of the other subpoena  duces tecums\n\n \n\n\nIt first it should be recalled if Your Honors please that under\nArticle eleven of the Constitution the House of Representatives shall have\nthe sole, shall have the exclusive power to initiate all cases of\nimpeachment\n\n\nNo other body has that authority not the Senate not any other\ndepartment of government\n\n\nOn the other hand the Senate has the sole power to try and decide\nall cases of impeachment\n\n\nA case of impeachment comes before the Senate if Your Honors please\nin the form of Articles of Impeachment which are sent to the Senate by the\nHouse of Representatives\n\n\nThe power of the Senate the sole power of the Senate to try and\ndecide a case of impeachment cannot go beyond the allegations in the Articles\nof Impeachment\n\n\nIssues now before the Court revolve on Article two\n\n\nAt the preliminary conference the first preliminary conference held\namong the parties it was agreed that under Article two the issue would be the\nfollowing whether on the basis of the facts and I underscore the word\n\n\" facts \" alleged therein the President would be guilty of\ngraft and corruption\n\n\nOnce again I underscore the word \" facts \" \n\n\nLet me now invite the members of the Court to go through the\npertinent provisions uh  uh the pertinent provisions portions of\nArticle two copies of which I have distributed\n\n\nIt says  President Estrada violated the Constitution and he\nstands guilty of graft and corruption  \n\n\nThose that clause if Your Honors please is a conclusion of law it\nis not a statement of fact\n\n\nThen it proceeds to state  when he participated directly in\nthe real estate business through a family-controlled corporation which\nconstructed thirty-six townhouses in Vermont Park Executive Village Antipolo\nCity as shown in the P C I J in the article on President Estrada 's Family\nand Financial Interests  \n\n\nThat clause is a statement of fact\n\n\nThe following paragraph reads  He also violated the\nAnti-Graft Law he is sworn to uphold  \n\n\nThat Your Honors is a conclusion it is not a statement of fact\n\n\nAnd then it the following follows  He filed his Statement of\nAssets and Liabilities for the year nineteen ninety-nine stating therein that\nhe and his wife and children have business interests in only three\ncorporations  \n\n\nThat Your Honors is a statement of fact\n\n\nFollowing that is the sentence  The President by that sworn\nstatement also committed perjury and the offense of unexplained wealth\n\n \n\n\nThat Your Honors is a conclusion\n\n\nThen what follows is this statement of fact because it says  \nRecords show that he and his wife and mistresses and their children have\nother interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in his\nStatement of Assets  open parenthesis Annex C  zero  close\nparenthesis\n\n\nStatement of facts in the last sentence reads and I repeat  \nRecords show that he and his wife and mistresses and their children have\nother interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in his\nStatement of Assets and Liabilities  parenthesis Annex C  zero\n\n nothing more Your Honors\n\n\nSo let me start with the easier one cash assets\n\n\nThere is nothing in these Articles of Impeachment which states that\nthe President failed to declare in his Statement of Assets and Liabilities\ncash assets\n\n\nNor in the second does he in the second sentence do we find any  uh any any statement of fact about assets because in the second\nsentence it simply says  Records show that he and his wife and\nmistresses and their children have other interests in other companies outside\nof the three firms listed in his Statement of Assets and Liabilities  \n\n\nSo what is alleged as a factual basis of the assertion that the\nPresident violated his sworn statement by committing perjury and the offense\nof unexplained wealth incidentally there is no such offense as simply limited\nto the failure to state in his Statement of Assets and Liabilities other that\nis other interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in\nhis Statement of Assets and Liabilities\n\n\nAs I said insofar as the cash assets there is nothing whatsoever\nhere\n\n\nNow, it will be noted if Your Honors please in Annex C Annex C\nis a comprehensive list of corporations in which the Respondent is supposed\nto have other interest which interests rather which he did not declare in his\nStatement of Assets\n\n\nAll in all these corporations number eighty-eight corporations some\nTable two of the President Table three Guia Gomez Table four Laarni Enriquez\nTable five Joseph Victor Ejercito Table six  selected companies\nof Estrada and his families\n\n\nSo insofar as corporate interests if Your Honors please what need\nto be determined is whether in the case of the second envelope St. Peter 's\nHoldings is listed is among these corporations listed in Annex C\n\n\nAs far as the second envelope is concerned if Your Honors please\n, we may  we may deduce from the application that the\nintention is to establish that the check which was supposed to have funded\nthe payment for what we call the Boracay mansion purchased by St. Peter 's\nHoldings was funded in ultimately from savings account O one six zero six two\nfive zero one dash five and that is why what is sought now to be produced is\nthe statement of account for October one to thirty-one nineteen ninety-nine\n\n\nIt may be recalled if Your Honors please that uh when on December\nfifteen uh December twenty the first envelope was opened it was found that in\nthat envelope there were the applications to open accounts specimen\nsignatures etcetera of account number and uh one one zero two five four nine\nfour  dash five as well as microfilm copy of the Equitable Bank\ncheck numbers\n\n\nThose were what were in the first envelope\n\n\nNow what is now sought to be produced is the statement of account\nof a savings account which we assume the prosecution contends will show that\nthe check which was used to fund the price for the payment of the what we\ncall Boracay mansion in the name of St. Peter 's Holdings was funded from\nthis statement from this account savings account\n\n\nSo in effect what is now asserted is to prove that the President\nwas the one who acquired the Boracay mansion through St. Peter 's Holdings\n\n\nBut as we have stated St. Peter 's Holdings is not among the\ncorporations listed in Annex C\n\n\nThere is one other flaw if Your Honors please\n\n\nAfter the first envelope was opened which should have been the\npremise assuming uh my assumptions are correct in regard the second envelope\nnot any of the documents in the first envelope was marked as an exhibit\n\n\nSo that if the papers in the first envelope are the predicates for\nthe opening of the second envelope that predicate does not exist\n\n\nBecause the papers which were found in the second envelope have not\nbeen marked as exhibits much less established as belonging to  \n\n\n the issue of relevancy\n\n\nThey go to the issue of jurisdiction whether the jurisdiction of\nthe Senate to try and decide this case goes beyond can go beyond the specific\nfactual allegations of the Articles of Impeachment\n\n\nIt is our submission that the Senate is without jurisdiction to try\nand decide any accusation based on any act other than those which are\nspecifically alleged in the Articles of Impeachment\n\n\nNow as to the other subpoenas if Your Honors please they are\naccounts even far removed from the account supposedly related to the\nacquisition of a property by St. Peter 's Holdings\n\n\nThey involve cash assets or their equivalent\n\n\nWell perhaps as far as the accounts of President in the name of\nPresident Estrada and the First Lady assuming that cash assets are\ncontemplated are covered by the Articles of Impeachment we may say they are\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Court\n\n\nBut you have other accounts uh which are the subject of subpoena\n\n duces tecums  \n\n\nSome of the subpoenas apply uh for subpoena  duces tecum\n\n to be directed to account numbers without any names\n\n\nHow can the relevancy the fact that these are within the  within covered by the Articles of Impeachment be determined on the basis\nof the application\n\n\nSimilarly you have this Kevin Garcia Jose Velarde and other names\nwhich are not in the names of the President and not even in the names of\nLaarni Guia Gomez\n\n\nThey cannot be presumptively they cannot be deemed as presumptively\nbelonging to the Respondent\n\n\nThere is one other noteworthy fact if Your Honors please regarding\nthese applications for subpoena\n\n\nIt will be recalled that uh it was agreed among the parties that\nwhen a subpoena  duces tecum  is applied for the\nparticular check if it be a check which would show the relevancy of the\napplication would be indicated\n\n\nAnd that beyond that there cannot be a comprehensive or catch-all\nphrase to cover all documents and records in that account\n\n\nThese applications for subpoena  duces tecum  \nhave sought to circumvent the agreement that there should be no comprehensive\nclause in subpoena  duces tecums  addressed to banks\n\n\nWhat the prosecution has done is to list everything that one may\nfind in a bank account or ledgers or accounts except that instead of saying\nthat all ledgers all accounts they have now specified this one by one\n\n\nThat is why if Your Honors please the applications for subpoena\n\n duces tecum  s have have uh enumerations of documents\ncovering about two pages in single space of documents\n\n\nAs a matter of fact if Your Honors please in the case of the second\nenvelope if assuming the  assuming that that is within the\njurisdiction of the Senate what should only the subpoena  duces\ntecum  should be limited only to what is necessary to determine\nwhether the check that was drawn on the current account was funded from the\nsavings account\n\n\nIt would be inappropriate even assuming that purpose to expose the\nentire statement of account for that month much less other documents\npertaining to that savings account\n\n\nAs a matter of fact uh assuming that the Court does not sustain us\non the jurisdiction issue and that uh the prosecution 's desire is simply to\nestablish that the check was funded from that savings account we would be  be willing to stipulate that assuming that that is the purpose\n\n\nSo then if Your Honors please the issue is not really that\ncomplicated but it is an issue which we have raised many times in this uh\ntrial\n\n\nUnfortunately there has really been no definitive ruling on this\n\n\nPerhaps it is time that a ruling be made because what has happened\nreally when the first envelope was opened we raised that issue\n\n\nBut then the whole the documents had already been exposed and so we\nsaid since the matter has been made practically public uh we agreed not to\npursue our motion for reconsideration but reserving our right to object on\nthe matter of materiality or jurisdiction\n\n\nSimilarly when the Clarissa Ocampo testimony was made we likewise\nobjected but the testimony was allowed to be given although conditionally\ngiven\n\n\nSo the issue before the Court if Your Honors please is simply\nwhether the Articles of Impeachment contain any allegation of fact to show\nthat the act the alleged act of the President in having cash assets or\ninterests in corporations other than those listed in Annex C are sufficiently\nalleged in the Articles of Impeachment so that the Senate would have\njurisdiction to try and decide them", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b4ad63f2-624b-431c-bf82-5631f90fd209", "added":

komportable na pong nakaluhod   \n\n\nSo far the issues I have heard have always stressed one theme\n\n\nThe Philippines is weak\n\n\nTherefore  sandal tayo sa pader\n\n\nYun po ang sinabi ng kumpare ko  \n\n\nMany others have said we are weak let us seek the protection of the\nbig\n\n\nBut who will protect us from the big\n\n\nNobody answered\n\n\nBut we are weak\n\n\nThe solitary issue then is will this Special Treatment Agreement\nmake us stronger\n\n\n Yun ba ang sinasabi  \n\n\nOr will it make us weaker\n\n\n Dito po pag nagpagapos tayo masasanay na naman tayo\n\n \n\n\nThe Special Treatment Agreement will not make us stronger it will\nmake us weaker\n\n\nAnd that is why we have insisted we must vote \" no\n\n\" \n\n\nYes we want to be strong but this Special Treatment Agreement that\nthey call the Visiting Forces will make us weaker\n\n\nIf we follow the logic of those who have said we are weak  \nmaghanap na tayo ng padrino kawawa naman po ang mahihirap\n\n\nKawawa naman yun maliliit\n\n\nPasensiya na kayo\n\n\nMaghanap na kayo ng padrino sapagkat hindi n'yo matutulungan ang\nsarili n'yo  \n\n\nAnd we cannot accept such a principle\n\n\nThat is the result of the colonial experience\n\n\nThree hundred fifty years  po yun mga haciendero yun mga\npare yun mga may lupa\n\n\nSila ang amo lahat ay mga alipin\n\n\nMakaalis po sila dumating nadaya pa tayo dumating ang mga Amerikano\nsila din ang amo  \n\n\nLater on we elected our leaders and many among our elected leaders\nfelt  kami na ang amo  we must enjoy all the benefits\n\n\nAnd that is why we are weak because many among our leaders tell our\npeople you are weak you are weak\n\n\n Pahina ng pahina  \n\n\nAnd so they become inefficient\n\n\nAnd when they become inefficient the government becomes weaker and\nthen they say you see we are weak because  ninakaw mas mahina na po\ntayo\n\n\nPinapapahinain ang gobyerno pagkatapos idadahilan upang maghanap ng\npadrino  \n\n\nThat is not what I understand of military courage\n\n\nOne of the mysteries I have had to endure all through today and\nduring the debate is how my good noble valiant friends in the military have\nto sit here and suffer the indignity of being called \" we are weak\n\n\" \n\n\n Mahina ang military\n\n\nAko'y hindi po naniniwala\n\n\nNakita ko po ito si General Mayo andito\n\n\nMatapang po 'to  \n\n\nI saw him in Bicol I saw him in Mindanao and I have seen the\nvaliant people even the enlisted men not being given eight pesos eight pesos\n\n ata noon pag sila'y nasusugatan  and they raise money in the\nfamilies raise money  pag nasusugatan  because  kulang\nang badget ng militar  \n\n\nI do not share the sentiments of our colleagues who kept saying\nhere repeatedly that our military are weak\n\n\nI rather share the sentiments of one of our colleagues who in\nnineteen ninety-one said the military of the Philippines is the most\nexperienced we have fought many wars with meager resources and we have\nexperience and we have guile and we can win\n\n\n Yun po ang paniwala ko  \n\n\nBut you must first believe in yourself\n\n\nThe question this then Mr President is how do we become strong\n\n\nWell certainly not by an Agreement that insults us\n\n\nBecause when you keep accepting insults you will get used to living\nwithout dignity and you cannot be strong\n\n\n Hindi pwedeng nag-ba  basketball  e

shoot\n\n\nConfidence self belief in self-reliance that is what will make us\nstrong\n\n\nAnd it can be brought about by education\n\n\nThis can be brought about by fighting corruption\n\n\nBecause if we lose only twenty percent of the national budget on\ncorruption and we can say that we shall have enough money to give bullets and\nguns to our military\n\n\nIt is ideas that make people strong Mr President\n\n\nRizal had the answer to our problems\n\n\nUnfortunately he seems to have been forgotten altogether\n\n\nIt was Rizal in  El Filibusterismo  who said\n\n We must win our freedom by deserving it by improving the mind and\nenhancing the dignity of the individual loving what is just what is good what\nis great to the point of dying for it\n\n\n When a people reach these heights God provides the weapons\n\n\nAnd the idols and the tyrants fall like a house of cards and\nfreedom shines in the first dawn   \n\n\nIn another sequel of  Filibusterismo  he says\n\n As long as the Filipino people do not have sufficient vigor to\nproclaim head held high  hindi nakayuko  and chest bared their\nright to a life of their own in human society and to guarantee it with their\nsacrifices with their very blood as long as we see our countrymen feel\nprivately ashamed hearing the growl of their rebelling and protesting\nconscience while in public they keep silent and even join the oppressor in\nmocking the oppressed\n\n\n As long as we see them rotting themselves in their selfishness\nand praising with forced smiles the most despicable acts begging with their\neyes for a share of the booty from those who are powerful\n\n\nWhy give them independence\n\n\nThey can never be independent   \n\n\n At eto pong  Treaty  - ng ito tinatawag kong\n\n special treatment that is exactly what it is doing\n\n\nGive us a share of the all powerful the only superpower\n\n\n Mabigyan po naman kami kahit mumog mabigyan kami  \n\n\nWe do not deserve to be free when that is the posture that we  always take\n\n\nEven the Americans will not respect us\n\n\nThe Americans were bred on a concept of self-reliance on a\nphilosophy that the human spirit can overcome and that is why they are a\ngreat country\n\n\nWe do not propose to be great like the United States\n\n\nNo\n\n\nWithin the limits of our geography and our people our people are\ngood our people are talented\n\n\nUnfortunately many of our leaders had betrayed our people\n\n\nAnd maybe now they should reexamine whether this Treaty is good for\nour people or betrays our longings for dignity independence and freedom  \n\n\n Ibon man daw pong may layang lumipad ikulong mo't\npumipiglas\n\n\nTayo pa kaya\n\n\nNakalaya tayo noong nineteen ninety-one babalik tayo\n\n\nTayo lang ang ibon na babalik sa hawla   \n\n\nRizal also said and this maybe is the saddest testimony that we can\nhear because this is from \" The Philippines A Century Hence\n\n\" I think one hundred six years or one hundred eight years ago\n\n\nAnd yet it has been unrequited\n\n\nBut Rizal was optimistic he said the Philippines one day will\ndeclare herself inevitably and unmistakably independent\n\n\nNeither Spanish patriotism call it something else nor the appeal of\nall the little tyrants in the colony nor the love for Spain or maybe America\nof all the Filipinos nor the doubtful dismembering of the islands the way\nthey have done in the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and\ninternal strife the way they are saying let us seek American help so that we\nshall have peace and tranquility in the land\n\n\nNone of these can go against the law of destiny\n\n\nAnd that law of destiny eventually will transform physical laws put\ninto action by moral forces\n\n\nIt is the moral force of the Filipino and his courage Mr President\nthat will make us free\n\n\nBut this Treaty is depriving us of that moral force depriving us of\nthe courage to stand up and try to stand up by ourselves\n\n\nMr President one of our colleagues said we cannot be isolated\n\n\nOf course\n\n\nWho has said we should be isolated\n\n\nDid he name any\n\n\nDid any of the oppositors to this Special Treatment Agreement ever\nsaid we should isolate\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNobody said \" isolation \" \n\n\nWe have always stressed that we must preserve our friendships with\nour ASEAN brothers\n\n\nThe A B Cs of diplomacy America Britain China Canada Europe Japan\nand the Latin American countries with whom we have historical ties these are\nall sought to be friends\n\n\n Hindi pwedeng kabit ng isa  \n\n\nBecause how will your other friends feel\n\n\nAnd that is why Mr President the reference to isolation was a\nbogey man\n\n\nYou raise the straw and beat him to death and say see I have won\nthe argument\n\n\nNobody but nobody has talked of isolation\n\n\nAs a matter of fact Mr President I think the push is towards\nmultilateral arrangements and the Secretary here of  of Foreign\nAffairs was even pushing for that\n\n\nBecause bilateral arrangement Mr President between uh the big and\nthe small is disadvantageous to the small\n\n\nAnd so they say to China  malaki ang Tsina Pilipinas maliit\ndapat  multilateral  daw  \n\n\nAnd yet they do not remember that  malaki din ang Amerika\nmaliit ang Pilipinas  \n\n\nBut the Americans are saying what is good enough for China\n\n\nPut them in a multilateral arrangement is not good enough for them\n\n\n Nakikita nila kausap mong malaki dehado ang maliit kaya\nnaman pinipilit nila na tayo maliit isa-isa lang kausap nila  \n\n\nThat is the reality of the situation\n\n\nThe Agreement Mr President truly, chains us\n\n\nWhat is amazing Mr President is that even reality could not be\nconsidered an argument against this Agreement\n\n\n  Security nang security\n\n\nNoong una noong si Blair sa Singapore tinamaan ng baltik at\ntinanggap na sabi'y walang security ay hindi naman daw security pala ang\npinag-uusapan dito economics\n\n\nSo economics na naman\n\n\nSa economics naman pagbasa mo ng Agreement wala naman doon\n\n\nSo wala ding economics\n\n\nPero hindi na bale daw\n\n\nHindi na baleng walang security hindi na bale walang economics\nbasta meron tayong kasangga\n\n\nNapakasuwerte natin\n\n\nNoong sabihin ng mga ibang mga nasa simbahan prostitution daw ay\nmadadagdagan aba hindi raw\n\n\nNadadagdagan daw ang prostitution kung permanent ang bases\n\n\nKung dumadaan-daan lang konti daw ang prostitution\n\n\nPara naman silang hindi nakakaalam\n\n\nPag two months kang nasa bapor sa gitna ng Pacific Ocean pag\nlanding mo sa General Santos maghahanap ka ng makakaraos sa iyo\n\n\nYun temporary nakakadaming prostitute sapagkat temporary naku\nsixteen days lang tayo nasaan ba yung mga Pilipinang magaganda   \n\n\nEven reality cannot be used as an argument anymore\n\n\n  Less daw ang prostitution  \n\n\nNoong una binabandila nila V F A two\n\n\nNoong basahin ang V F A two at walang mabigay sa Pilipinas sila\nmismo tinago na hindi na binabanggit ang V F A two\n\n\nAng V F A two siguro matatawag V F A torotot   \n\n\nBecause it was a  torotot  agreement\n\n\nWe got nothing but a bill of rights from the United States but\nthat is already granted to Filipinos if you 're in the U S\n\n\nWe must vote \" no \" Mr President because of\nfidelity to the Constitution\n\n\nThe Constitution in the Preamble has glowing words\n\n\nIt says  We the sovereign Filipino people imploring the aid\nof Almighty God in order to build a just and humane society and establish a\ngovernment that shall embody our ideals and aspirations promote the common\ngood conserve and develop our patrimony and secure to ourselves and our\nposterity the blessings of independence and democracy under the rule of law\nin a regime of truth justice freedom love equality and peace do ordain and\npromulgate this Constitution  \n\n\nThe Preamble does not hold water anymore Mr President\n\n\n Hindi na pwedeng  we cannot have the blessings of\nindependence  sapagkat tayo ay nagpapatali  \n\n\nWe cannot have a rule of law  sapagkat eto lang ang botong\n\n third reading  na hindi naman pinagbotohan ng  second\nreading\n\n\nAnd yet the rules say you must have second  bilang yun\nparang  arithmetic first second and third\n\n\n Kung walang  second reading  walang\n\n third reading\n\n\nWe cannot have the regime of truth because even prostitution\n\n mawawala na daw sapagkat  temporary  ang daan  \n\n\nMr President we cannot even live up to the Preamble\n\n\nWe cannot live up to Section one of the Principles that the\nPhilippines is a democratic and republican state because in a republican\nstate there is no law that cannot be modified\n\n\nBut now we must add unless of course it is a Special Treatment\nAgreement with the Americans then do not touch it\n\n\nYou can touch it later on  pag may nakita kang abuso\n\n and that should be modified\n\n\nSection two Mr President speaks of amity with all nations but now\nwe must se say except China because  sila daw ang malaki at kalaban\nnatin  \n\n\nWe can no longer say civilian authorities at all times supreme\nover the military unless we add except U S military authorities\n\n\nThey are superior both to the Philippine military and the highest\ngovernment authorities of the Philippines because the Agreement says so\n\n\nWe can no longer say the prime duty of the government is to serve\nand protect the people because we must add unless there is a certificate of\nofficial duty\n\n\nBecause  kung may  certificate of official duty\n\n at mabaril ang Filipino 't napagkamalian na baboy damo  we\ncannot protect the people\n\n\nAnd that is why Mr President equal protection of the laws is no\nlonger extended to the Filipino after if at all after this Special Treatment\nAgreement becomes law\n\n\nWe cannot allow that Mr President\n\n\nDylan Thomas once in a poem said  Do not go gentle into\nthat good night\n\n\n Rage rage against the dying of the light   \n\n\nIf we were vigorous if we were strenuous in our effort to examine\nall these Special Treatment Agreements it was because Mr President we did not\nwant to go gentle into that good night\n\n\n Papagapos ka pa nga ni wala ka pang reklamo  \n\n\nThere 's one other poem I want to narrate to our friends who may\nbe minded to listen but certainly to our people who I 'm sure would want to\nhear\n\n\nThere 's a poem entitled \" Ithaca \" \n\n\nIt recounts the hometown of Ulysses and Ulysses had to go home\n\n\nAnd the poem \" Ithaca \" says I will paraphrase\nbecause I do not have it memorized basically said this, when you start\nyour journey to Ithaca pray that the road is long full of knowledge full of\nadventure and said it says do not fear the  Leslegonians   yun\npo ang mga  cannibals nor the angry Poseidon  yun po ang\n\n god of the undersea nor the one-eyed Cyclops it says because you\nwill be protected\n\n\nThey will not harm you so long as you have fine feelings and noble\nthoughts\n\n\nWhat you must fear the poem says are the  Leslegonians  the\nPoseidons and the Cyclops that you carry in your soul\n\n\nWhat you must fear is the fear that you carry in your heart\n\n\nAll the arguments in favor of this Agreement this Special\nTreatment Agreement was premised on that\n\n\nThey want us to be afraid and to carry that fear in our hearts\n\n\nIt is not the way to become a people with dignity it is not the\nway to become a people of independence it is not the way to become a people\nthat can look other people in the eyes with equality with pride\n\n\nThese are the thoughts I wish to share Mr President\n\n\nYou can ask permission to clean it up because after speaking for\ntwo hours and a half in  turno  and  kontra\n\n we did not have the energy to prepare a prepared speech\n\n\nWe vote \" no \" Mr President to ensure dignity and\nindependence for the Filipinos\n\n\nThank you Mr President  1", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A>  \n\n\nMr President distinguished colleagues  permit me to\nread a letter dated May 12 addressed to me\n\n\nDear Senator Guingona\n\n\nIn the wake of the Senate debates concerning the Visiting Forces\nAgreement I recall that the lead department during its negotiation was the\nDepartment of Foreign Affairs\n\n\nThe Department of National Defense and the D O J lent support in\nrelation to their respective areas\n\n\nI was a member of the ad hoc team of prosecutors and lawyers that\nassisted you then in the study of the D O J position\n\n\nFrom the inception of the discussion on the proposed V F A you were\nresolute in finding an agreement that was just and equitable\n\n\nFor this reason you stressed to your D O J team and the Cabinet and\nat Cabinet meetings the importance of resolving the recipre reciprocity issue\nif the conclusion of the V F A was to be feasible meaning as a precondition\nthereto\n\n\nThe United States should agree to implement a counterpart\nreciprocal agreement in favor of the Philippines\n\n\nI did not have the chance to be a part of the team that negotiated\nwith the United States as I was appointed to the judiciary\n\n\nThe Agreement was concluded much later when I which I heard\noccurred in February nineteen ninety-eight when you and I had already left\nthe Department of Justice\n\n\nI take this occasion to extend my best wishes\n\n\nSincerely\n\n\nTeresita Leonardo De Castro\n\n\nJustice of the  Sandiganbayan  \n\n\nMr President may I request that this letter the original be uh\ninserted along with my speech\n\n\nPermit me also to reiterate the statement of my friend Secretary\nSiazon pursuant to uhrm the testimony during the public hearings on January\ntwenty-six nineteen ninety-nine and I quote Your honor just to put the uh\nissue in correct perse historical perspective the reason why we have a V F A\ntwo is when we were negotiating or before we started negotiation negotiating\non V F A one because of the advice of the then Secretary Justice Guingona\nwhose advice I respected and shared that we should have some similar\ntreatment for our boys and their families when they go to the United States\n\n\nI made this as a condition to the Americans\n\n\nWe would now start negotiating on V F A one but later to negotiate\non a similar or for some similar treatment V F A two close quote\n\n\nPermit me also Mr President to read into the records the letter of\nPresident Ramos dated February uh May fourteen nineteen ninety-nine\n\n\nDear Senator Guingona\n\n\nTito in the midst of the ongoing debate on the Visiting Forces\nAgreement let me say that even during the negotiations for the same you\nalready held strong reservations because in your view you wanted a fair and\njust agreement between the two nations\n\n\nHaving recommended the scrapping of  Balikatan  \nexercises because you believed that no firm legal basis existed therefore\n\n\nRegarding the V F A you stood on full reciprocity as a condition\nand the submission of the same to the Senate for concurrence in accordance\nwith the Constitution\n\n\nI respect you for your convictions although your position on the V\nF A may differ from mine\n\n\nNevertheless I continue to hope that you will see the V F A in a\nbetter light\n\n\nWith best wishes\n\n\nFidel Valdes Ramos\n\n\nMay I ask Mr President that this the original of this letter be\nattached and uh be an integral part of my speech  \n\n\nThese documents Mr President show my stand on the V F A even during\nthe period of negotiation\n\n\nWe stood for a just and fair agreement we stood for reciprocity we\nstood for submission of the same to the Senate for concurrence\n\n\nBut the outcome of the negotiations did not result in a just\nagreement did not entail any reciprocity did not end up in a fair agreement\n\n\nThere was V F A two but no reciprocity\n\n\nThere was submission to the Senate but none to the U S Senate\n\n\nI therefore stand more vigorously opposed to this Visiting Forces\nAgreement today\n\n\nI vote \" no \" for historical reasons\n\n\nA century ago Emilio Aguinaldo relied on the promise of United\nStates Consul in Hong Kong to help gain Filipino freedom\n\n\nHe virtually invited the first Visiting Forces of the United States\nto come to the Philippines\n\n\nAdmiral Dewey came\n\n\nAnd look where it got us\n\n\nWe had to fight a war that until now the United States refers to in\na cavalier manner as a petty insurgency versus her manifest destiny\n\n\nAmerica gave us many good things\n\n\nShe gave us education she taught us the lessons of Washington and\nLincoln and Jefferson and gave us back our independence in the wake of war in\nnineteen forty-six\n\n\nBut she also imposed upon us foreign military bases\n\n\nShe imposed upon us the parity amendments she imposed upon us the\none-sided special economic relation that tied and dominated our economy and\nmilitary bases for almost fifty years until nineteen ninety-one when we said\n\n\" no \" to the Base Agreement\n\n\nToday I cannot but say \" no \" again to a Visiting\nForces Agreement that may repeat the sad lessons of history\n\n\nI vote \" no \" because this Agreement violates the\nequality of persons and nations\n\n\nThe activities mentioned in the Agreement Articles three four five\nsix seven and eight make the United States personnel a special class of\npersons treated much better than the Filipinos in their own land no\nreciprocity no equality of national and personal rights and therefore I vote\n\n\" no \" \n\n\nI vote \" no \" because this Agreement was submitted\nunder a wrong provision Article seven Section twenty-one of the Constitution\n\n\nThe framers of the nineteen eighty-seven Constitution intended to\ncorrect a wrong when the United States imposed military bases upon us\n\n\nThey virtually mandated the Philippine Senate to ratify not to\nratify without submitting the same to the United States Senate\n\n\nSo Article eighteen Section twenty-five of the Constitution\nprohibits the presence of foreign military bases troops or facilities unless\nan agreement is ratified by the Philippine Senate and equally recognized as a\ntreaty of the United States in accordance with her Constitution\n\n\nThis was the intent this was the prohibition this was the remedy to\ncorrect a slur  poised  upon us by the Bases Treaty\n\n\nWhy should our Senate concur and not the United States Senate\n\n\nWhy should we refrain from following the mandate of our\nConstitution and make the V F A part of the law of the land while the United\nStates considers the same as a mere executive agreement\n\n\nWhy do we not rectify the wrongs of yesterday by reciprocity\n\n\nThere is reference that during our time we issued opinions that\ntemporary visits were not covered by treaties and international agreements\n\n\nThese opinions were merely routinary opinions responding to queries\nby the Department of National Defense or the Department of Foreign Affairs on\nspecific subjects and following precedents we did issue such opinions but\ncertainly not on an agreement such as the Visiting Forces Agreement because\nthis would entail a temporary permanent permanent temporary Agreement that\nwas not envisioned in any of those opinions\n\n\nMr President I vote \" no \" because the V F A is\nimprecise uncertain unclear\n\n\nThe Agreement speaks of activities but there are no clear\ndefinitions of what the activities are\n\n\nDo they include deployment of United States forces entries exits of\naircrafts repair and maintenance of facilities access arrangements commercial\ncontracts construction of rails and runways rest and recreation\nestablishments of relay stations telecommunications\n\n\nNo clear answers no clear definition no limits no certainties\n\n\nIt can only lead to disastrous implementation if approved and the\nAgreement does not spell out how many troops may come who where they may\nvisit when\n\n\nIt does not say how long military exercises may take\n\n\nWhen we accept the visitor we usually welcome him into the\nreceiving room\n\n\nBut under this Agreement the Visiting Forces may enter the living\nrooms they may go into the kitchen they may go into the dens and enter every\nnook and corner of this land and therefore I vote \" no \" \n\n\nI vote \" no \" because of the uncertainties of the\napproving authorities\n\n\nThe Agreement itself says that the activities must have the\napproval of the Philippines of the Philippine government but the same is\nnegated by the fact that there exists a Mutual Defense Board pursuant to the\nMutual Defense Treaty that would recommend the activities to carry out\nsecurity and defense arrangements\n\n\nThe framework of the M D T includes activities that carry out\neffectively the objectives of the security and defense agreements to improve\nand enhance common defense\n\n\nTherefore while the proponents of the V F A contend that the\nactivities will be approved by our Government in truth and in fact such\nclaims may yield to the realities of the  Mutual Defense Board\nwhere military activities are to be recommended for decision by the United\nStates and  Philippine military men for decisions will\nultimately be forged by our Secretary of Foreign Affairs and the United\nStates Secretary of State\n\n\nDecisions Mr President affecting the destiny of this nation in the\nhands of a body infused with foreign counterparts\n\n\nCan the Filipinos in that body say \" no \" when the\nUnited States representatives demand can they resist the clout military\npolitical economic that dominates such relations can the proposed oversight\ncommittee prevent undue acquiescence\n\n\nI vote \" no \" Mr President because the V F A may\nnot attain the objectives that the sponsors tell us is necessary because it\nwill give life to the M D T it will help modernize our Armed Forces it will\ntrain us with the latest technology all to ensure the safety and security of\nthe nation and the region against inter external attack\n\n\nPerhaps\n\n\nBut the creeping invasion referred to lies in the Spratlys and the\nUnited States herself does not recognize the political sovereignty of the\nPhilippines over the Kalayaans and they have time and again claimed\nneutrality over the Spratly dispute not only between us and China but also\namongst the five nations claiming the same\n\n\nThe M D T itself limits the United States response to\nConstitutional processes after an unarmed attack on metropolitan Philippines\nunder any vessel in pap  in the Pacific and the Spratlys lie\noutside metropolitan Philippines and the Pacific\n\n\nThis was done in nineteen fifty-one when the United States nor the\nPhilippines dreamed of the Spratlys talked about the Spratlys\n\n\nIt was a time when Japan gave up any sovereign claims over the\nSpratlys\n\n\nAnd so therefore all of these considerations together with the\nglobal consideration of the huge market of China etcetera make the claim that\nthe United States would go to war for us over the Spratlys seem unlikely\n\n\nModernize the Armed Forces\n\n\nTrain us\n\n\nTeach us the latest technology\n\n\nAgain perhaps\n\n\nBut we had joint military exercises with the United States forces\neven before and after the World War second\n\n\nWe held exercises with them when the bases were here since nineteen\nforty-seven to nineteen ninety-two\n\n\nWe held  Balikatan  exercises with them even after\nthe bases were gone\n\n\nWe leave it to the people 's judgment whether or not our Armed\nForces have become modernized because of those exercises whether or not we\nlearned of the latest technologies because even the guns and the tanks and\nthe planes furnished us like the Huey helicopters are admittedly hand-me-down\nequipments destined to limit our progress and keep us attuned to mendicancy\n\n\nMr President we can modernize within our means\n\n\nThere are lease purchase arrangements from other countries like\nIsrael France Russia\n\n\nIsrael built an army from the ground up\n\n\nMany other nations started from poverty and rose because of\nself-reliance\n\n\nWe can have a corps of highly trained professional soldiers\n\n\nLet us not be blinded by the fact that just because we are poor we\ncannot have an efficient Armed Forces\n\n\nWe do not need quantity as much as quality good pilots seasoned\nseamen trained troops on the ground because as the great dramatist said\n\n the fault dear Brutus is not in the stars but in ourselves that we\nare underlings  \n\n\nLet us cast aside this mendicant attitude that we need crutches all\nthe time\n\n\nLet us cast aside the perception and the belief that we do not have\nconfidence in ourselves\n\n\nLet us cast aside always leaning to Mother America\n\n\nWe need self-reliance not a gilded cage\n\n\nWe need faith not blind adherence to a foreign power that dominated\nour national life since the turn of the century\n\n\nThe United States desires presence in our land because her global\nstrategy is patterned after global presence\n\n\nLess bases but more V F A and Status of Forces Agreements\n\n\nLess expense but more widespread involvement and her line of\ncontainment in our region seems to lie between Japan South Korea to Taiwan\n\n\nWe are excluded as a reserve pawn\n\n\nBut if China and Jap and uh Taiwan reunite the line of containment\nmay bring us to the fore and we may repeat the perils of nineteen forty-one\nand the grim lessons of Bataan and Corregidor all over again\n\n\nThe United States Mr President acts for her own interest\n\n\nLet us act for our own interest\n\n\nTne United States desires presence in the Philippines because she\ndesires to ensure free passage of the sea lanes in South China\n\n\nThis coincides with our national interest but the United States\ndesires presence as well because of economic interests in the Spratlys for\ngas and oil and other mineral marine resources which may conflict with our\nown national interests because the United States herself does not officially\nrecognize our political sovereignty there\n\n\nLet us then act for our own not rely on a Big Brother whose main\nconcern is his own self-interest\n\n\nLet us go the diplomatic way\n\n\nLet us have our own strategy\n\n\nLet us go to the International Court and the Law of the Sea if\nnecessary\n\n\nLet us formulate our own and relearn the lessons of history\n\n\nI vote \" no \" Mr President because of the\ngrievous harm the deaths the deformations the illnesses due to the infusion\nof toxic wastes which contaminated our land and seas in the past due to the\npresence of military bases", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f92dfdd4-6878-4621-aa53-2ee2ebd3d113", "added":

{"text": "<$A>\n\n\nThank you Mr Chairman\n\n\nMr Chairman uhm may I make comments with respect to ballot boxes from\nSingapore Brazil New Zealand and Italy and more particularly with respect to\nMalaysia and Czech Republic, comments\n\n\nThe uh number in words for the votes of candidate Gloria\nMacapagal-Arroyo was erased replaced with uh new handwriting because all of\nthese contained in the carbon copies are in words\n\n\nLikewise the votes for candidate Loren Legarda the number that is was\nlikewise erased replaced with the uhm the numbers five hundred twenty-one\n\n\nUh Mr Chairman I would like to place on record that this is a clear\ncase of an erasure in the C O C\n\n\nIn fact after it was made because obviously the ink in the C O C\ncopies that is colored blue because it is merely a carbon copy of the first C\nO C in which the uhm Board of Canvassers Canvassers wrote on however the\ncorrection was made individually for each <unclear> words </unclear> the\nnames in black\n\n\nMay I also make of record Mr Chairman that unlike the C O C contained\nin ballot box number twenty-one wherein the alteration or erasure was\ninitialed the  the erasure and alteration found in the C O C\nfor Malaysia was not initialed by anyone\n\n\n As a third point Mr Chairman as a final point uhm \n\n\nUhm at the risk of stating it again \n\n\n\nAnd having said that Mr Chairman may I pose a manifestation at the\nsame time inquiry\n\n\n For the record  Senator Biazon member\nof this twenty-two-man committee  \n\n\nNow since this matter has been raised on several occasions by the\nlawyers Mr Chairman uhm Senator Biazon is not here right now uhm at a proper\ntime may we know from Senator Biazon what that information is because it\nmight be relevant  sa  canvassing being conducted by this\n\n\nNow on a personal point at this juncture Mr Chairman again as I said\nit is only for the record at a proper time may we get a response or reply or\nclarification from the <unclear> words </unclear>\n\n\nThank you \n\n\n<$A>\n\n\nThank you Mr Chairman\n\n\nSeveral points Mr Chairman if I will be given the leeway insofar as\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nFirst of all for the record according to the face of the C O C the\nvotes obtained by F P J is twenty-four thousand five hundred seventy-four\n\n\nThe votes obtained by G M A was twenty-one thousand one hundred\neighty-five\n\n\nIn other words  and having said that allow\nme to make my observations Mr Chairman and the reason why I am making this\nposition\n\n\n\n\n\nNow several times the word \" disenfranchisement \"\nhas been used whenever there is a motion from either the counsel or a member\nof this committee to set aside a particular C O C\n\n\nMr Chairman distinguished members of this committee I think the\nproper term is \" defer \"\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one is being disenfranchised in fact we are protecting the right\nof every voter by ensuring that in the votes they cast in the last elections\nwill be the ones that will be counted\n\n\nNext point Mr Chairman\n\n\nDuring the deliberations on the rules Senator Pangilinan the sponsor\nof the rules said and you can check the records on this matter that the S O V\nis one of the documents against which we can prove the authenticity and due\nexecution of a particular C O C because it will reveal whether or not the\nvotes stated therein would tally with respect to the tally contained in the C\nO C\n\n\nUhm thirdly after the rules were adopted and approved this\nrepresentation Mr Chairman sought permission from the Senate President\nprecisely to point out one fact\n\n\n\n\n\nAt that point Mr Chairman this representation stood up and asked the\nChair \n\n\nEven at that early stage that was Thursday last week we made the\nnecessary representations <unclear> words </unclear> the record whose records\nthey have in their custody the S O V by precinct \n\n\nI do not know Mr Chairman uhm if not stopped by the House either in\njoint session or by the joint committee\n\n\nAgain Mr Chairman we do not seek to delay or further delay this\nproceeding\n\n\nIn fact that suggestion was made a week ago precisely to avoid this\nsituation\n\n\nNow later on after some other comments have been made probably a\nmotion will be made to produce the S O V prior to canvassing this particular\nC O C\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Mr Chairman uhm if I may finally state \" authenticity\n\" pertains to signatures thumbmarks paper serial number fibers but\n\" due execution \" means that all of the <unclear> words\n</unclear> for every single C O C were filled up in accordance with law\n\n\nAnd the law simply states that \n\n\nAnd the only way to find that out is at the very least  by precinct for this particular C O C for this particular\nprovince\n\n\nAgain Mr Chairman to reiterate Section seventeen of our very own\nrules state that we should look for erasures or alterations in either the C O\nC or the S O V by precinct\n\n\nHow can we find out if there are erasures or alterations in the S O V\nby precinct if we cannot even look at it or see it here before us\n\n\nMay I reserve my right Mr Chairman the proper time to seek redress\ninsofar as the production of the S O Vs\n\n\nThank you \n\n\n<$A>\n\n\nThank you Mr Chairman\n\n\nUhm according to Congressman Abad there is no need for Section\nseventeen to come into operation because there seems to be no erasure or\nalteration in the C O C\n\n\nHowever Section seventeen is clear  if there is no alteration\nin the C O C or statement of votes by precinct \n\n\nNow I agree with Congressman Abad\n\n\nIndeed there is no alteration or erasure in the statement of votes by\nprecinct because we did not even see it\n\n\nHow can I even know if indeed there is an alteration or erasure in\nthe S O V by precinct if we could not even get a good chance to see it\n\n\n alteration and erasure in S O V by\nprecinct\n\n\nHowever Mr Chairman having said that may I reiterate the words the\nsuggestion earlier made made by Senator Pimentel and the suggestion of this\nrepresentation made in plenary \n\n\nMay we request for uh the Chair to instruct the Secretary General to\nlook <unclear> words </unclear> to stay open <unclear> word </unclear> do not\ncontain S O Vs by precinct and for the necessary representations to be made\nby the Chair probably to Comelec for them to produce or make available at\nleast those copies so that at a proper time we will not be uh there will be\nno delay insofar as this particular issue is concerned\n\n\nAnd as a last point Mr Chairman I take it from the statements of the\nHonorable <unclear> word </unclear> and Honorable Abad that indeed if there\nis no doubt as to the number of votes cast for President and Vice President\nthere is no need to go down to either the S O V by precinct or <unclear>\nwords </unclear> the election returns\n\n\nWithout conceding that point Mr Chairman I will hold them to their\nword at a proper time\n\n\nThank you \n\n\n<$A>\n\n\nMr Speaker Mr Senate President distinguished colleagues in the House\nand in the Senate allow me to answer these issues raised before us\n\n\nIt is sad to note that the joint committee at the very onset was\nplagued with partisan politics\n\n\nThe National Board of Canvassers should have been non-partisan in\ncarrying out its function of canvassing the votes cast for President and\nVice-President\n\n\nHowever unlike in previous years the composition of the joint\ncommittee tasked to preliminarily canvass the votes were made to conform to\nthe majority-minority representation in the House and in the Senate\n\n\nHence as it turned out six members from the Senate appointed to the\njoint committee were allied with or supported a Presidential candidate five\nothers supported another Presidential candidate the other Presidential\ncandidates have no representation much less a voice in the same\n\n\nIn the House of Representatives eight members represented a candidate\nor supported a candidate one represented three candidates however one\ncandidate was not represented at all except through an alternate member\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all of the decisions not a single decision was made wherein the\nvotes cast went beyond or below the representation of the majority in both\nthe Senate and the House\n\n\n\n\n\nBut at the onset it was created precisely to function in that manner\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second issue here we face is the issue or debate between the\nelection returns and the certificates of canvass\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the longest time Mr Speaker Mr President a lot many members of\nthis august body have been saying that we cannot we are not authorized it is\nillegal for us to go down to the returns\n\n\nIt was only now Mr Speaker Mr President that an admission and a clear\nadmission at that was made that indeed Congress could have should have voted\nin that direction\n\n\nIt could have looked at the election returns\n\n\n\n\n\nI thank the distinguished sponsors last night for on the record\nmaking and giving that admission to lay the issue finally to rest\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply put the majority voted not to look at the return\n\n\n\n\n\nSerious allegations of fraud were made by counsels for the various\nPresidential candidates allegations which is unfair to say the least to the\ncandidate accused of fraud and yet the accusation was left alone\n\n\n\n\n\nBrother Eddie Villanueva wrote the joint committee and said that he\nwould have wanted at least three C O Cs to be opened up for us to be able to\nlook at the election returns\n\n\n\n\n\nJust one C O C for us to find out two basic facts\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond will it actually take us fourteen years to go down to the\nreturns\n\n\nWill it take us six hours as some claim\n\n\nDon\u0092t take our word for it neither will we take yours\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was said during the sponsorship speeches given in relation to the\nmajority report that not a single C O C was presented by any of the counsels\nmuch less the opposition\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will be useless to compare our copy of the C O C with the six\nother copies of the C O C\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Speaker Mr President, whenever we asked that we go down to the\nelection returns \n\n\nMr Speaker I listened intently to the speeches and interpellations\nlast night\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Speaker I\u0092m of the belief that whenever we see something wrong we\nshould at first sight seek to correct it\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Speaker it has been said also, that we seek to exclude certain\ncertificates of canvass by objecting to it thereby disenfranchising millions\nof voters or thousands of voters\n\n\nWe seek Mr Speaker Mr President not the exclusion of C O Cs but\nrather its deferment to find out the true and actual vote of our people\n\n\n\n\n\nWe seek not to accuse you as being cheaters rather we seek to fight\nfor the truth by ensuring that indeed you were not cheated in the last\nelections because Mr Speaker Mr President in the final analysis it is not the\ncandidate who was cheated of these elections\n\n\nIt was for all intents and purposes the Filipino people and not the\ncandidate in whose favor they voted\n\n\nMr Speaker a while ago my good friend Digs Dilangalen quoted the\npreamble\n\n\nAllow me to seek emphasis by ending my brief sponsorship to the\nminority report in the reverse by citing the preamble which reads and states\nwithin it\n\n\n We the sovereign Filipino people imploring the aid of the\nAlmighty God in order to build a just and humane society and establish a\ngovernment which shall embody our ideals and aspirations promote the common\ngood conserve and develop our patrimony and secure to ourselves and our\nposterity the blessings of independence and democracy under the rule of law\nand a regime of truth justice love equality and peace do ordain this\nConstitution \n\n\nMr Speaker Mr President in the hierarchy of values the framers of\nour Constitution chose to put primordial among the rest the value of truth\nover freedom over love over peace over justice\n\n\nAnd Mr Speaker Mr President that is all that we are asking for\n\n\nDistinguished colleagues whether or not watchers signed or did not\nsign the C O C or the election returns will not and cannot change the truth\n\n\nWhether or not you vote for or against the committee report whether\nor not you vote to look at the election returns it will not change the truth\n\n\nIf in a few minutes we vote in favor of a particular candidate it\nwill not change the truth\n\n\nOur votes in this hall cannot Mr Speaker Mr President change the\ntruth\n\n\nNeither can time change the truth\n\n\nI am for the truth Mr Speaker Mr President because the truth is\nunbiased\n\n\nThe truth as it has been said favors no one\n\n\nThis is beyond F P J this is beyond G M A\n\n\nThis is beyond any other candidate nor personality because in so far\nas we are concerned Mr Speaker we will stand by and will always fight for the\ntruth however lonely that fight may be\n\n\nThank you Mr Speaker distinguished colleagues \n\n\n<$A>\n\n\nUh Mr Speaker thank you Mr Speaker\n\n\nUh Mr Speaker I believe that uh the  uh the\nadjournment uh of Congress as a legislative body does not affect our function\nto canvass\n\n\nThat\u0092s why uhm I believe that there is a distinction between the\nlegislative function and uh our mandate to canvass the votes of the President\nand Vice- President\n\n\nIf we look at the Constitution uh Mr Speaker that provision to\ncanvass the votes of the President and Vice-President is actually under the\nexecutive branch of government uh with this uh Article seven Section four Mr\nSpeaker so even if we have already adjourned uh Congress in its regular\nsession we emanate our power from this Constitutional provision that Congress\nis tasked to canvass the votes for the President and Vice-President that is\nwhy it is in  the this provision the power to canvass is embodied\nin Article seven Section four which is actually uh the article for the\nExecutive Department Mr Speaker because we are actually doing an\nadministrative function\n\n\nSo when we call Congress in a joint public session that power Mr\nSpeaker is derived from uh Article seven Section four of the Constitution and\nit is not a legislative function it is indeed an executive function\n\n\nThank you Mr Speaker \n\n\n<$A>\n\n\nThank you Mr Speaker\n\n\nUh to our uh humble opinion the uh canvass must be an exception to\nthe adjournment  sine die \n\n\nIt is an exception because uh otherwise there would be created a uh\nsituation where provisions of the Constitution will run athwart each other\n\n\nI say that uh although I would agree that uh a canvass is not a\nspecial session it is a uh specific uh act given to Congress empowered to\nCongress uh which would be the canvassing body that would proclaim ultimately\nthe President and the Vice-President\n\n\nSo if we now adjourn uh  sine die  somehow there\nwould be created a grotesque situation where Congress will still be\ncanvassing the votes for the President and the Vice-President\n\n\nI would say that if we follow the thirty-day rule of uh adjourning\n sine die  the general rule is adjournment  sine\ndie  when there is no Presidential or Vice-Presidential election\n\n\nBut when there is a Vice  Presidential and\nVice-Presidential election this is going to be an exception and that the\nadjournment  sine die  should not uh be declared by\nCongress\n\n\nCongress has has uh to still proclaim the President and that if we\nagain adjourn  sine die  there would be we would endanger\nthat particular uh act of Congress to still be existing at the time of the\nproclamation so I say that this is an exception to the general rule of uh uh\nthe general rule Mr Speaker", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A>\n\n\nMr Chairman Mr Chairman, Mr Chairman uhm I would like to reiterate\nuh the statements uh propounded by the Honorable uh Escudero of Sorsogon and\nuh with due reference also to the statements made by the lawyers uh earlier\nuh by saying that we would see that the the law <unclear> word </unclear> is\nsuddenly <unclear> word </unclear> so in that sense the uh support of the\nstatement of the Honorable uh Congressman from Sorsogon I would read the law\n\n\nThe last paragraph of Section twenty-nine of Republic Act seventy- one\nsixty-six Republic Act seven one six six is  an act to provide for the\nsynchronization of the national and local elections and to provide electoral\nreform  that is the title of the law and in Section twenty-nine last\nparagraph if I may read  the certificate of canvass prepared by the\nCommission Board of Canvassers shall be supported by a statement of votes by\nmunicipality and the original copy of for the Congress shall in addition be\nsupported by statement of votes by precinct as submitted to the Provincial\nBoard of Canvassers by city or municipal Board of Canvassers \n\n\nVery clear in the law that you see a Board of Canvassers is mandated\nto place in this ballot box not only the C O C the municipal uh the S O V by\nmunicipality and as well the S O V by precinct\n\n\nIt is mandatory unlike the requirement to submit election returns \non site  .\n\n\nThis one is very specific that it should be included here in this\nballot box\n\n\nAnd therefore this is in line also for the uh <unclear> word\n</unclear> with Section thirty of the law that whenever we discover there are\nerasures and there are uh alteration we have to refer to these documents and\nwhen we discover erasures and uh or alterations in an S O V by precinct if it\nis not <unclear> words </unclear>\n\n\nSo may I may I suggest in the same way as the Honorable Escudero\nsuggested two days ago that in the meantime we defer this uh ballot uh ballot\nbox uh uh for uh the province of uh Quirino while we are producing the uh the\nS O V\n\n\nAfter all this will just be uh reported uh in the same way as we have\nsummoned the witnesses for the Comelec candidate\n\n\nWithout delaying let us proceed to the other the other ballot boxes\n\n\nIn that way we will be able uh to have an understanding of <unclear>\nword </unclear> and not necessarily delay this canvassing Mr Chairman \n\n\n<$A>\n\n\nThank you very much Mr Speaker\n\n\nMr Speaker uh I have been wondering why there shall be an adjournment\nreally uh since uh this has even caused the delay in the in the canvassing\n\n\nWe have already made a headway and suddenly surprisingly uh notice\nwere sent to us and for purposes of uh adjournment uh as been uh said as\nprovided in the Constitution\n\n\nThat Mr Speaker I don\u0092t quite agree that we should adjourn\nconsidering the fact that we are also mandated at this instance to do uh the\ncanvassing\n\n\nThe Constitution does not make any distinction whether we are\nfunctioning as a legislative or as a canvassing\n\n\nThe uh the word uh the House of Representatives is is in session is\n<,> to say that there are certain responsibilities there are certain\nactivities that must be performed by Congress when it is in in session\ncontrary to when Congress is in recess where members of the House are not\ndoing its regular work\n\n\nAnd canvassing is part of the regular work of Congress being\nenshrined in the Constitution\n\n\nNow this adjournment by the looks alone of the members uh not in\nagreement with each other might create a crisis might even uh be raised in\nthe Supreme Court because we might not be able to proceed Mr Speaker\n\n\nI \u0091m afraid that there must be an or there was a reason why this\nadjournment is called and I \u0091m afraid that with this the agenda is not to\ncontinue the canvassing and I \u0091m afraid that if we don\u0092t continue this\ncanvassing there will be no proclamation especially Fernando Poe is already\nleading\n\n\nSo therefore I am for the  continuing of the session\nand that we will be able to canvass the uh \n\n\n<$A>\n\n\nThank you Mr Speaker\n\n\nIf I may add uh my unsolicited two cents \u0091 worth of opinion to this\nuh proceeding\n\n\nMr Speaker if we do adjourn  sine die  this\nafternoon we are not adjourning Congress we are adjourning the regular\nsession of Congress which is provided in Section fifteen of Article six of\nthe Philippine Constitution\n\n\nNote Mr Speaker that Section fifteen speaks of Congress convening\nonce every year on the fourth Monday of July for its regular session unless a\ndifferent date is fixed by law and shall continue to be in session that means\nin regular session for such number of days as it may determine until thirty\ndays before the opening of the next regular session\n\n\nI agree Mr Speaker with the Honorable  Majority Leader\nthat it is not Congress that is adjourned\n\n\nWhen we adjourn our regular session we do not terminate the existence\nof Congress\n\n\nAfter we adjourn our regular session we can be called to a special\nsession before the termination or the expiration of the term of office of the\nmembers of this House on June thirty\n\n\nNow when we do meet again in joint public session in order to\nproclaim the winning Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidate that joint\npublic session Mr Speaker I submit is in the nature of a special session\n\n\nIt is in the nature of a special session that need not be called by\nthe President of the Philippines because Section four of Article seven\nspecifically calls Congress precisely to that joint public session for the\npurpose of canvassing and later proclaiming the President-elect and the\nVice-President-elect\n\n\nThen there should be no controversy\n\n\nIt is not Mr Speaker that Congress is schizophrenic that it has\nmulti- personalities even as it does have multi-duties and functions\n\n\nThe matter of legislation is taken up in its regular and special\nsessions, the matter of canvass is taken up in this joint public session\nwhich uh uh is provided by Section fourteen\n\n\nTrue there are  there are different functions of Congress\nbut this does not at all detract from the fact that Congress must as a\nlegislative body perform its function and so Mr Speaker I hope that I have\ncontributed a bit to clarify the matter \n\n\n<$A>\n\n\nThank you Mr Chairman\n\n\nMr Chairman to underscore the fact that Congress continues to exist\nas a body Congress may be called to a special session by the President of the\nPhilippines\n\n\nIf it is called to a special session that is recognition that\nCongress is still existing all the way up to June thirty\n\n\nNow is it necessary for the President to call Congress to a special\nsession in order that it may sit as a national canvassing board\n\n\nI submit \" no \" because the Constitution itself in\nSection four of Article seven already calls Congress to sit as a special\nsession\n\n\nIt would be superfluous for us to ask the President of the\nPhilippines to call Congress to a special session since after all when the\nPresident calls Congress to a special session it is in order that the\nCongress may take up legislative matters\n\n\nIn this particular instance we have the Constitution itself calling\nCongress to sit as a national canvassing board independently of any call for\na special session by the President\n\n\nThank you Mr Chairman \n\n\n<$A>\n\n\nUh Mr  Mr Chairman  I think uh we\nshould distinguish the various rules we have here\n\n\nThere can be no question that both the Congressmen and the Senators\nall of us here should remain in office up to June thirty\n\n\nSo up to June thirty we \u0091re still Senators we \u0091re still Congressmen\n\n\nNobody can deprive us of that\n\n\nSo as Senators and Congressmen what will we what are we supposed to\ndo\n\n\nNow so much has been uh raised about Section fifteen the rule on\nlegislative powers which reads that  Congress shall convene once every\nyear on the fourth Monday of July for its for its regular session unless a\ndifferent date is fixed by law  and  etcetera etcetera\n\n\n\nWhat \u0091s referred to by Section fifteen is \" regular session\n\"\n\n\nSo under our legislative calendar our regular session ended in I\nthink July uh June June eleven\n\n\nThat is our regular session\n\n\nSo the question is, is Congress deprived of other things\n\n\nMy respectful submission Mr Chairman is that \" no \"\n\n\nIf you scan the powers of Congress you will notice that if the\nPresident of the Philippines should declare martial law or suspend the\nprivilege of the writ of  habeas corpus  Congress is\nduty-bound within forty-eight hours to meet to approve or disapprove of the\naction of the President without need of call in fact\n\n\nAnd then whatever Congress does cannot be changed by the President so\nthat even now if should the President of the Philippines suspend the\nprivilege of the writ of  habeas corpus  or impose martial\nlaw we can meet and approve or disapprove what the President has done\n\n\nSo with that Mr President we have powers continuing powers which\ncannot be deprived by even an adjournment of Congress\n\n\nAdjournment is nothing more than adjournment and as I alluded to\nearlier assuming that there was adjournment that adjournment referred to the\nregular session\n\n\nBut more directly to the point Mr President Mr Chairman in our role\nas canvassers we should look, to Section four on the executive department\nwhich is the canvassing powers\n\n\nLittle noticed is this provision  the person having the\nhighest number of votes shall be proclaimed elected but in case two or more\nshall have an equal and highest number of votes one of them shall forthwith\nbe chosen by the vote of uh a majority of all members of both Houses of\nCongress voting separately \n\n\nWhat does this mean Mr Chairman\n\n\nIt means that should in the remote possibility that there is a tie we\nare called upon to break the tie as legislators not even as canvassers\n\n\nWhy\n\n\nBecause that is a power a sovereign power vested in us to choose or\nbreak the tie\n\n\nAnd the moment we break the tie whoever we favor becomes President of\nthe Philippines\n\n\nThat is a reserve power so even now should our canvass say that there\n\u0091s a tie we can meet and break the tie\n\n\nI I \u0091ve brought two  uh uh two instances Mr uh Mr\nChairman  why the  why Congress has still\ncontinuing powers to convene even after the adjournment last June eleven\nbecause there are certain powers that we must exercise if the exigencies\narise\n\n\nThat \u0091s why Mr, Chairman all of this all of this uh debate is not\nreally to the point because we have still reserve powers which we \u0091ll have to\nexercise I I so it \u0091s my respectful submission Mr Chairman that uh we\ncontinue to have powers we can convene any time up to the end of our terms\nbecause our powers are not diminished one whit up to June thirty\n\n\nWe are not deprived of anything\n\n\nWe only followed the rule of rule uh I mean Section fifteen which\nsays that thirty days before the end of session we have to uh uh we have to\nadjourn but that is refers only to regular session\n\n\nSo Mr Chairman I think we, proceed and uh go on on with the\ncanvass because uh uh I don\u0092t think that the uh uh assertion that uh we have\nadjourned uh I think has no uh Constitutional leg to stand on\n\n\nThank you Mr Chairman \n\n\n<$A>\n\n\nMr Chairman while I agree with the uh recommendation of Senator\nPimentel that uh following Section fifteen and also following the ruling we\nmade on the Biliran case that uh those uh missing documents if ever should\nshould should be produced uh within the day that is provided in our rules\n\n\nBut at the same time strictly speaking uh uh Mr Chairman going by the\nstandards that uh is are provided for in Section fourteen uh the C O C of\nCapiz uh is is authentic and duly executed and the discrepancy noted on the\nface of the C O C is not uh the discrepancy that is uh uh described or of  in Section fourteen \u0091cause in Section fourteen it says no discrepancy\nin other authentic copies of uh the certificate of canvass or discrepancy in\nthe votes of or of any candidate in words and figures in the same certificate\n\n\nSo strictly speaking we did not go through that exercise in the\ndetermination of authenticity and due execution but  \u0091yun \njust for the sake of  satisfying ourselves about this seeming uh\nuh inconsistency in the phase we went through that but I don\u0092t think that it\nis necessary in the determination of due execution and authenticity\n\n\nTherefore Mr Speaker I think it is in order for us to proceed with\nthe canvass of uh the uh Capiz C O C while at the same time you know uh I as\nI said that I agree with the recommendation of uh Senator Pimentel as\nprovided for in Section fifteen and as we agreed upon in the uh Biliran case\nMr Speaker", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "76af63aa-c5e1-4909-848d-b89273be7a39", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.247680+00:00"}

killed while three of his companions were wounded in a shoot-out with elements of the Traffic Management Group in Quezon City last night\n\n\nReports indicate the S A F chanced upon two Traffic

Anti-Organized Crime Task Force engaged a group of hold-uppers in a shoot-out near S M Fairview in Quezon City this morning leaving all seven gang members dead\n\n\nSix of the suspects reportedly died on the spot while the seventh expired before reaching the hospital\n\n\nThe seven suspects were members of the Palmores Miguel Gang which had been long under the task force 's

Chair Amable Aguiluz says he is ready to face all accusations being thrown at him\n\n\nAccording to Aguiluz 's legal counsel Attorney Luis Pangulayan there is no basis for the allegation that Aguiluz has been receiving a payola from private companies\n\n\nPangulayan also denied the Millennium Solutions Corporation which has been selling Y two K solutions to private companies is a dummy corporation under Aguiluz\n\n\nThe said corporation is part of the AMA Group of Companies which is owned by the Aguiluz family\n\n\nAguiluz for his part says it is impossible for a conflict of interest to exist since he has divested himself of all responsibility and ownership in the AMA Group of Companies ever since he assumed the chairmanship of the Y two K Commission\n\n\nPangulayan also points out that Aguiluz has been out of the private sector for two years making it impossible for any of the accusations to be true  \n\n\nThere is still a possibility that the hot cars may still fall under the hands

million peso-bond for the T R O but says it is now secondary to the immediate implementation of the rollback\n\n\nCITRA on the other hand disputes Mendoza 's assertion\n\n\nMotorists in the area now fear that the twenty-day T R O may lapse without the rollback being implemented\n\n\nMarquez is encouraging motorists not to pay the rates but still stick to the old fee for the Magallanes to Bicutan

Dante Piandong were convicted for a nineteen ninety-four robbery during which they killed Caloocan City Police Officer Gerry Perez\n\n\nWhile the President was unforgiving of Echegaray he says there is still hope for the three death convicts now\n\n\nEstrada gave them a ninety-day reprieve to allow their cases to be reviewed\n\n\nEven so Estrada insists the government 's stand against crime remains as strong as ever  \n\n\nEstrada 's decision was influenced mainly by his spiritual adviser  El Shaddai  leader Brother Mike Velarde\n\n\nBrother Mike had suggested the review of the cases to see if all three men deserve the death penalty\n\n\nBrother Mike told the President it was inappropriate for the execution to take place so soon after the country had just finished celebrating the Holy Week\n\n\nThe President had previously hinted he might lift the death penalty on the three convicts if their crime was committed out of poverty\n\n\nBut while such an act might be deemed

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThank you Speaker Jose de Venecia\n\n\nSenate President Franklin Drilon the justices of the Supreme Court\ndistinguished members of the Senate and the House of Representatives His\nExcellency Archbishop Antonio Franco dean of the diplomatic corps Your\nExcellencies of the diplomatic corps members of the cabinet members of the\nArmed Forces of the Philippines members of the police fellow workers in\ngovernment honored guests  mga minamahal kong kababayan  \n\n\nIn the corridors of power in the Palace where I work past Presidents\nof the Republic sit in their portraits in judgment of me\n\n\nIn this gallery of the highest public servants none sits in sterner\njudgment than the man who first led me by the hand into the Palace as a\nteenager\n\n\nIn that country where a man 's worth was measured by his poverty he\nwas born in a  nipa  hut into a family that tilled less than a\nhectare of land\n\n\nAfter years of hard struggle and brilliant achievement my father\ntook his oath as President of the Philippines on ground made hallow by the\nmartyrdom of our national hero a hero whose name he would honor and whose\nideals he would pursue\n\n\nIndeed in a democracy a man may rise to the nation 's highest\nservice by dint of energy and intelligence alone without regard to wealth and\nconnections of which my father had none\n\n\nIt was Jose Rizal who wrote  a life dedicated to a great\nideal is useless uh not dedicated to a great ideal is useless a mere pebble\nin the field that forms no part of an edifice  \n\n\nThe words of Diosdado Macapagal echoed this theme has as he assumed\nthe mantle of national leadership forty years ago  no President can\nbuild the whole edifice of a nation  \n\n\nAll that he is called upon to do is to add a fine stone to that\nedifice so that those who shall come after him may add other fine stones that\nwill go for a strong and enduring structure   \n\n\nModest words from a modest man who would yet change for all time\nhow a feudal society would come to view a vital institution land reform\n\n\nMy countrymen the fine stone I should like to add to the edifice of\nour nation right above the stone of social justice that my father left behind\nis a strong republic\n\n\nTwo essential features mark out a strong republic\n\n\nThe first is independence from class and sectoral interests so that\nit stands for the interests of the people rather than of a powerful minority\n\n\nThe second is the capacity represented through strong institutions\nand a strong bureaucracy to execute good policy and deliver essential\nservices the things that only governments can do\n\n\nThe results of these two features good policies and empowered\ninstitutions is faster economic development and social reform\n\n\nA strong republic takes care of the people and takes care of their\nfuture\n\n\nThus a strong republic is the bedrock of the victory we seek over\npoverty within the decade\n\n\nDuring these past eighteen months our efforts to build the strong\nrepublic have been difficult with both domestic and global conditions\nextremely harsh\n\n\nAt home the poor were pitted against the rich to further inflame\nour nation 's social divisions\n\n\nAbroad the contracting economies of our main trading partners were\nfurther aggravated by the tensions generated by the global war against  terrorism\n\n\nMeanwhile one shocking corporate scandal after another severely\neroded public faith in the most promising system for conducting economic\nactivity the free market\n\n\nThese were the large long-term crises of social justice and the\ncapitalist system itself whose resolution awaits events well beyond one small\nnation 's ability to influence in the short term\n\n\nBut as I report on the state of the nation today I can say this the\nimmediate crises have been resolved\n\n\nThis resolution was achieved by focusing on three things\n\n\nFirst by showing tangible results in the delivery of government\nservices\n\n\nThus in my State of the Nation Address last year I did something\nnever done before I detailed a long list of measurable targets that would\nshow a government on the move marking progress by swift sure steps despite\nthe turbulent state of domestic and global affairs  \n\n\nThis is just the tip of our accomplishments all in just the first\nyear of the ten-year fight I projected against poverty\n\n\nI am submitting the entire iceberg to Congress in a comprehensive\nperformance report\n\n\nFor good measure it has been published and nationally circulated\n\n\nThese were our commitments\n\n\nWe delivered on them\n\n\nA strong republic does what it says\n\n\nIt takes care of the people and takes care of their future\n\n\nOur second focus to achieve the resolution of the immediate crises\nwas the preservation and defense of the Republic against forces that seek to\ndestroy its unity and tear the fabric of its society not least in the name of\nideas that history has already passed by\n\n\nThe turning points are clear\n\n\nThis year May one passed peacefully\n\n\nThis year our soldiers rescued Gracia Burnham and finished off her\nterrorist captor  \n\n\nThis year what used to be Camp Abubakar became an authentic\ncommunity of new hopes and dreams where our flag flies and our soldiers\nprotect those who have returned to their homes\n\n\nBeyond the symbolic significance of these accomplishments we have\nbrought back inter-faith  solidarity energized by the\ninvaluable initiative of Speaker Jose de Venecia  and we\nhave sealed peace agreements with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front\n\n\nWe achieved all of these backed by the valor professionalism and\nrestraint of our soldiers and police\n\n\nI salute our men and women in uniform at the forefront of our\nRepublic 's efforts to fight terror and enforce peace\n\n\nThe third focus to resolve the crises and build a strong republic\nwas to restore macroeconomic stability and win back investor confidence\n\n\nThe linchpin was to control our fiscal deficit\n\n\nIf EDSA two had not happened the government would simply have gone\nbankrupt with a deficit of two hundred forty-five billion pesos  \n\n\nBut we controlled the deficit brought it down to a hundred\nforty-seven billion pesos and against all odds turned our international\ncredit rating from \" risky \" to \" stable \" \n\n \n\n\nIt was hard work here and abroad to rekindle global interest in our\ncountry but we did it  \n\n\nThe adoption of strong administrative measures including fighting\nsmuggling and graft and corruption will enable us to close the gap in our\nrevenue targets for this year\n\n\nThe basic macro signs indicate that things are under control\n\n\nInflation is at a low driven down by stable food prices and now by\ndeclining power costs   \n\n\nInterest rates are also at a low\n\n\nAnd our peso is stable from fifty-six pesos to the dollar it is now\na little over fifty pesos  \n\n\nInternationally the Philippines is back on the map\n\n\nWe are the third best-performing economy in Asia and the best in\nSoutheast Asia  \n\n\nAs a result of our decisive action after September eleven the\nPhilippines is now a recognized player in world affairs\n\n\nThe President of the Philippines was the first head of government\nto emphasize the interconnection between the war against terrorism and the\nwar against poverty\n\n\nNow nations large and small embrace this interconnection  \n\n\nWe have gained powerful allies in our domestic war against\nterrorism\n\n\nI am certain that our increased international visibility will\ncontinue generating capital inflows for the Philippines\n\n\nWhere we have fallen short of achieving what we intended it has not\nbeen from misdirection or a lack of trying\n\n\nAfter all it has really been only one year and a half\n\n\nIn any event I promise to work even harder if that is possible and\ndo even better because I believe that there is always room for improvement\n\n\nI cannot grow taller but I can always get better  \n\n\nMy working agenda for the coming year will focus on creating and\nimproving job opportunities\n\n\nCitizens with rewarding jobs paying decent wages constitute not\njust a stone in the edifice but the very foundation of a strong republic\n\n\nWe need investments to generate jobs and to draw in investments we\nwill address certain problems in the short term  katiwalian  \npeace and order and the cost of power    \n\n\nBut even now I can tell you that our new e-procurement program is\nsaving billions and minimizing anomalies\n\n\nEven now I can tell you that the Presidential Anti-Graft Commission\nis doing its best to ensure that good governance is carried out  \n\n\nThis is still a continuing effort\n\n\nTax evasion is a white-collar crime and the response is a\nwhite-collar response systems improvement audit prosecution\n\n\nSmuggling is something else\n\n\nIt is done by hoodlums and criminal gangs\n\n\nBut the punishment for both must be the same blue-collar time\n\n kalaboso   \n\n\nIndeed criminal gangs and homegrown terrorists have exploited the\npoisoned political atmosphere to spread poisons of their own kidnapping\ngambling drug-dealing rampant smuggling\n\n\nYou have seen political will in the harsh interpretation of command\nresponsibility with regard to illegal gambling\n\n\nThat draconian application was a dress rehearsal for enforcing\ncommand responsibility in the even more difficult challenges of kidnapping\ndrug-dealing and smuggling  \n\n\nI am determined to build a strong republic by breaking the back of\nterrorism and criminality  \n\n\nIn the year two thousand despite all the rampant efforts of rampant\nsmuggling only sixteen million pesos worth was confiscated\n\n\nBut last year in a show of political will my administration seized\none point two billion pesos worth of smuggled goods  \nincluding more than a million bags of smuggled rice as compared to much less\nthan a hundred thousand the year before\n\n\nI congratulated the Commissioner of Customs but told him also go\nbeyond getting the smuggled goods and get me the big time smugglers  \n\n\nI have instructed the D O J to charge these big-time smugglers not\njust with smuggling but also with economic sabotage non-bailable capital\noffense  \n\n\nCriminal syndicates will be treated as what they are direct threats\nto national security\n\n\nCriminals are criminals whether of the common kind or the kind that\nwill kill in the name of political advocacies\n\n\nThey will feel the full brunt of the arsenal of democracy\n\n\nFreedom too is entitled to self-defense\n\n\nI have given very clear orders to spare nothing in hunting down\nkidnappers\n\n\nWe will go by scorecards and track progress by counting beans if we\nhave to\n\n\nRemember Mary Grace Rosagas of Uratex who was kidnapped from U P\n\n\nRemember her aunt Connie Wong who was killed by the kidnappers\n\n\nRemember Rowena Tiu who was kidnapped in La Union\n\n\nRemember the owner of Liana Supermarket\n\n\n remember the whispers about the kidnapping of a\ngranddaughter of a big banker and the son of a steel magnate\n\n\nWe have taken down the syndicates responsible for kidnapping them\nand fifty-two other victims  \n\n\nIn the process one hundred seventy kidnappers were either killed or\ncaptured\n\n\nThe ideal response to kidnapping was in the case of Rowena Tiu\n\n\nShe was rescued in eight days the ransom money recovered and her\nkidnappers were arrested and are now facing trial\n\n\nThat is why hers was the first but the last kidnapping to take\nplace in Region one in my administration\n\n\nI want to smash the other twenty-one syndicates in the same way  \n\n\nWe are getting a clearer picture of the leadership membership and\narea of operations of these syndicates\n\n\nI now want their linkages and modus operandi\n\n\nI 'm overseeing how they are being watched tracked and infiltrated\n\n\nWe will start with the two biggest syndicates the Bocala and\nFajardo gangs\n\n\nI have challenged the  Philippine National Police to\neliminate them within a year  \n\n\nI have told the P N P that they must start with the cleansing of\ntheir own ranks\n\n\nYou remember the front page photographs of that shootout last\nSaturday\n\n\nIn the front seat next to the driver was a P N P A P N P Academy\ngraduate but AWOL from the police force\n\n\nHe was the planner and negotiator of that gang\n\n\nThe rascals among the police disgrace the uniform and\nunfortunately paint in the same broad brush the majority who do their duty\nwell\n\n\nI salute the men and women of the police who scorned to be bribed\nand confiscated five hundred kilograms of  shabu  in Quezon\nprovince last year and caught the biggest fish so far in the drug trade\n\n\nI salute the men and women who raided the  shabu  \nfactories in Batangas Zambales San Juan Varsity Hills and other places\nseizing a total of five billion pesos worth of illegal drugs and laboratory\nequipment in the largest drug busts ever in our history of crime-fighting  \n\n\nWithin a month we shall organize the new Dangerous Drugs Board and\nthe Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency which Congress has just created and I\nthank Senator Barbers for sponsoring the bill in the Senate  \n\n\nWith the drug menace now elevated to the level of a national\nsecurity problem and no longer just a police problem I am instructing the\nArmed Forces of the Philippines to field military resources for intelligence\nand to field soldiers in drug raids in support of civilian law enforcement\n\n \n\n\nDrug lords will be treated as enemies of the state  \n\n\nIn this war with the drug trade there will be no compromise and no\nquarter not for fear or favor\n\n\nIndeed we are at war at war with the terrorists at war with the\nkidnappers at war with the drug lords and we are determined to win decisive\nvictories on all fronts  \n\n\nThe global anti-terrorist coalition is a historical watershed\n\n\nThis new global consensus helps us immensely in finally breaking\nthe cycle of terrorism and criminality\n\n\nTo that end we shall enhance our strategic relationship with the\nUnited States through continuing training exercises to sharpen our  capabilities to move and communicate to fix and finish off\ntheir targets  \n\n\nI am happy to let you know that yesterday we captured the\nmastermind of the General Santos bombings that killed and maimed eighty\npersons a few months ago  \n\n\nThis man that we captured yesterday is considered the number one\nexpert terrorist-bomber\n\n\nWe cannot afford to lose\n\n\nEven a stalemate will be a defeat\n\n\nFor what is at stake is our country as a viable proposition in the\nworld economy and we must be viable if we are to win the most fundamental war\nthe war against poverty  \n\n\nI ask the newly-elected  barangay  captains to take\nan active role in this war to be the frontliners in this fight in your\ncommunities\n\n\nAnd as with war in the past so will it be with this war\n\n\nAs commander-in-chief I am taking a direct hand in the war against\nthe enemies of the Republic  \n\n\nThis was how I did it with the Abu Sayyaf leading to the death of\nAbu Sabaya\n\n\nThis is how I will do it with the criminal gangs  \n\n\n Nakasalalay dito ang pamamayani ng ating republika\n\n our strong republic\n\n\nAt stake in this war is the very life of society the very\npossibility of basic rights and liberties which have been under attack for\ntoo long\n\n\nThe right to work in peace is as basic as the right to life and\nliberty and when both are in danger their preservation by all lawful means\nbecomes not just a higher right but an overriding duty\n\n\nAnd that duty I will discharge  \n\n\nThis is a war we will wage on behalf and with the rage of all the\nvictims those whose businesses were ruined by extortion those held down by\npoverty in fear those whose lives were snuffed out by addiction and those\ntaken hostage and killed\n\n\nTo them I say we shall redeem your pain we shall redeem your loss\n\n \n\n\nI endorse to the collective wisdom of Congress with a great sense\nof urgency a new bill that will strengthen our legal armory in this war the\nAnti-Terrorism Bill  \n\n\nWhen passed into law this bill will plug the loopholes by which\ncrimes spread and democracy is undermined\n\n\nCongress will also note a reallocation of resources in this year 's\nbudget to enhance the Republic 's crime-fighting capabilities  \n\n\nThere are a number of other critical bills linked closely to the\noverall run of social economic and political reform\n\n\nI will hold more meetings with the Legislative-Executive\nDevelopment Advisory Council or LEDAC to push this momentum of reform\n\n\nWe must team up as I said last year to enact a law making farm\nland acceptable as loan collateral in order to remove a big deterrent to\ninvestments in agriculture\n\n\nWe must pass the Special Purpose Vehicle Act in order to encourage\nasset management companies to put back into productive circulation assets now\ntied up in problematic loans\n\n\nWe must pass a law to give overseas Filipinos the right to vote\nconsistent with the Constitution  \n\n\nWe must pass the bill that will give equal respect and recognition\nto the overseas Filipino 's dual citizenship consistent with our national\nhonor  \n\n\nThese are the least

{"text": "<$A> \n\n\n \nYour Honor the Chief Justice of the Philippines Your Honor the Senate President of the Philippines Your Honors Members of the Senate esteemed colleagues of the defense friends ladies and gentlemen\n\n\nMembers of the Senate our team of prosecutors will show that during his brief incumbency of barely over two years Joseph Ejercito Estrada has violated the oath previously mentioned by Congressman Belmonte had violated the law not once not twice but regularly like clockwork\n\n\nThe prosecutors will again expose the existence of a criminal syndicate directed from the highest office of the land\n\n\nThis is the gangland mob that threatens to rule us\n\n\nThis not the parliament of the street is the mob rule\n\n\nThe mob rule that will savage our Constitution and the very fabric of our society unless we destroy it now before it destroys us\n\n\nI stated that we will expose the existence of the criminal syndicate again\n\n\nI use the word \" again \" because fortunately for our panel much of the shocking and sordid details of this story have been unfolded before this very chamber before Your Honors\n\n\nAnd our task will be to simply present in proper form the evidence and testimony which the Filipino people already know and have already evaluated for themselves and to link up some <unclear> word </unclear> sense\n\n\nIn our presentation we will therefore focus only on the salient points\n\n\nGovernor Chavit Singson will re-affirm before Your Honors the following facts and events\n\n\nSometime in August nineteen ninety-eight the newly elected President Joseph Ejercito Estrada summoned Bong Pineda Charlie Atong Ang and Governor Chavit Singson to his Polk Street residence to discuss  jueteng  operations in the country\n\n\nOn that occasion President Estrada prohibited Pineda from continuing to deliver  jueteng  collections to him as the latter was already identified as  jueteng  lord\n\n\nInstead he appointed both Ang and Governor Singson as his national  jueteng  collectors and delivery men\n\n\nOf course we all remember who Atong Ang is and his association with Joseph Ejercito Estrada\n\n\nBarely two months later however after a heated disagreement over the President 's refusal to give in to Atong Ang 's demand for a share in certain sugar allocations Atong Ang was stripped by President Estrada of his  jueteng  collection authority\n\n\nThis left Governor Singson as the presidential appointee in charge of these illegal collections\n\n\nThe testimony of Governor Singson will re-affirm that from November nineteen ninety-eight to August two thousand an average of five million pesos usually in crisp one thousand peso bills was hand-delivered by him to President Estrada every fifteen days either in his residence at Polk Street Greenhills or in Malaca&ntilde;ang or in the house of one of his mistresses Guia Gomez\n\n\nAnd for accounting purposes President Estrada assigned an auditor in the person of Mrs Yolanda Ricaforte wife of Tourism Undersecretary Orestes Ricaforte to monitor and deliver the receipt of the  tong  collections as well as the  disbursement therefrom in a ledger\n\n\nFor a period until June nineteen ninety-eight the excess of the  jueteng  collections after the five million peso for the President has been set aside every fifteen days would be earmarked by Governor Singson also on the orders of President Estrada for the  construction of the Fontainebleau Casino in the former Clark Air Base\n\n\nAlthough the true owner of Fontainebleau was the President on his instruction the stock holdings was placed in the names of Jaime de Chavez one of his cronies Jesus Pineda a schoolmate of his and Edmundo Silverio a nominee of Butch Tenorio the President of PAGCOR  \n\n\nThe President eventually opted to discontinue the Fontainebleau operation in favor of Fontana Casino where his stakes have been greater and financial rewards higher\n\n\nWhen it was decided to abort the Fontainebleau Casino operation Mrs Ricaforte also took over the duty of preparing the ledger and monitoring the collection and expenses of the  jueteng  operations including the sensitive task of depositing the presidential share in various accounts\n\n\n<unclear> 1 word </unclear> to Mrs Ricaforte all the accumulated collections from  jueteng  including future collections\n\n\nSo Mrs Ricaforte opened several separate accounts in different branches of Equitable Bank where she deposited the collections\n\n\nGovernor Singson will re-affirm that this year two hundred million was withdrawn by Mrs Ricaforte from the said deposits in Equitable Bank placed in various interim accounts to cleanse the dirty money before it was placed at the disposal of the lord of all gambling lords\n\n\nThe withdrawal of the amount also coincided with the shift of illegal gambling operation from  jueteng  to a bigger form known as Bingo Two Ball where the stakes are much higher this time using PAGCOR as front of the grand design to further centralize the rewards of gambling operations \n\n to Bingo Two Balls was motivated by the desire of greed for greater greater financial reward\n\n\nThe testimony of Governor Singson will be corroborated by several witnesses including the  jueteng  collection ledger which Mrs Ricaforte admits having maintained\n\n\nWe will present the checks that Governor Singson surrendered to Mrs Ricaforte on instruction of President Estrada\n\n\nWe will present the branch records of the separate bank accounts that Mrs Ricaforte opened on orders of President Estrada and where she deposited said checks on the succeeding  jueteng  collections\n\n\nWe will present to Your Honors the checks totaling two hundred million pesos which Mrs Ricaforte handed over and turned to lawyer by the name of Atty Edward Serapio\n\n\nWe will present the testimony of Atty Serapio at the hearing of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee where he admitted that he indeed was the  Presidential Assistant in Malaca&ntilde;ang at that time\n\n\nThat he was the personal legal adviser of President Estrada and of his families\n\n\nThat the two hundred million was transferred by him to the funds of the corporation that President Estrada ordered him to organize\n\n\nThat the officers of this corporation aside from himself was Raul de Guzman the brother-in-law of the President Estrada George Go the majority stock holder of Equitable Bank and the President 's banker and two employees of Raul de Guzman in U P\n\n\nWe will also show the open forum at the meeting of the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines or FOCAP where President Estrada made admissions corroborative of the accusations of Governor Chavit Chavit Singson against him\n\n\nIt is certain that the lawyers of the President will tell you that Governor Singson should not be believed because he has admitted being a co-conspirator in the commission of the crime\n\n\nBut in the statement <unclear> words </unclear> a co-conspirator should still be accepted even if uncorroborated when it is shown to be sincere in itself because given unhesitantly and in a straightforward manner and is full of details which by their nature could not have been the result of a deliberate afterthought\n\n\nWho is saying this\n\n\nThis is the pronouncement of our Supreme Court in the decision where they handed down that decision only recently last August\n\n\nAfter you have heard him determine on the basis whether Governor Singson deserves to be believed especially after we shall have presented you the corroborating documentary evidences in support of his testimony\n\n\nGovernor Singson will swear under oath that he personally handed five million pesos to the President every fifteen days commencing the year of nineteen ninety until the beginning of this year\n\n\nOnce made this is an accusation that nobody except the President can deny it\n\n\nIt is a denial that nobody but nobody can make for him under oath\n\n\nFor the past month President Estrada has gallantly promised time and again on television on radio in the newspaper that when the impeachment trial begins he will face the people and his accusers and answer all charges point by point\n\n\nWill the President still do so\n\n\nYour Honors as we have narrated our evidence will be the testimony of the very person who handed money to the President fifty million five million pesos every fifteen days like clockwork\n\n\nIt is a firsthand testimony\n\n\nThe rest of his story will be corroborated in other essentials not by other witnesses but by the very statement of the President himself\n\n\nAnd after we are through with our evidence we have no doubt that you Your Honors will render a judgment of conviction with a clear conscience\n\n\nThank you very much\n\n \n\n \n\n\nMr Chief Justice Your Honors I am Feliciano Belmonte Jr of the fourth district of Quezon City\n\n\nThis afternoon we the House prosecutors are tasked to fulfill a duty\n\n\nIt is a duty that none of us relish\n\n\nIt is painful painful because we will prove to the judges in this procidy proceedings that the faith and trust that we have bestowed on our President had been abused\n\n\nIt is a grave duty grave because we are asking the judges that Joseph Ejercito Estrada whom we elected as President be removed from the presidency at once for the sake of the country for the sake of the people\n\n\nIt is a burden that the Constitution has placed on the shoulders of the prosecutors and it is a duty that we will faithfully fulfill\n\n\nWhen I make reference to the judges in these impeachment proceedings Your Honors I am not addressing the Senators here assembled alone because it is not only Joseph Ejercito Estrada who has been put on trial here\n\n\nWe the prosecutors and the house of Congress that we represent this chamber sitting in judgment the judiciary here personified by the Chief Justice the moral values that we hold dear indeed the entire structure of government and our society all are as much on trial in these proceedings\n\n\nThe judges are the people who even now watch our every move and listen intently to our every word\n\n\nIt is they Your Honors whom we the prosecutors also address because it is to them, that we all are accountable for what we will do here  \n\n\nThey say that all trials have innocent beginnings  \n\n\nCentral to the oath taken by Joseph Ejercito Estrada before then Chief Justice Andres Narvasa who is now here with us are the phrases to quote to execute its laws and quote to consecrate myself to the service of the nation  \n\n\nThe prosecution will show that not only did Joseph Ejercito Estrada not execute the laws he was the first to violate them\n\n\nProsecutors will show that during his brief incumbency of barely over two years Joseph Ejercito Estrada has violated his oath of office had violated the law not once not twice but regularly like clockwork  \n\n\nBehind all this legalese what do these charges mean\n\n\nSimply that Joseph Ejercito Estrada has failed the Filipino people especially the poor betrayed their hopes and broke their dreams  \n\n\nAnd there is nothing mysterious or arcane about this process\n\n\nIt is not about lawyers it is not about technicalities\n\n\nCommon sense in the light of a person 's common experience is enough to appreciate the evidence and to reach a knowledgeable fair and patriotic conclusion\n\n\nI thank you Your Honors", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

us as enemy\n\n\nUnder military rule there was no freedom of movement\n\n\nThose who were critical of the regime were considered subversive\n\n\nThey were arrested for preliminary investigation and released a\nhalf year later only to be kept on constant surveillance later to be arrested\nagain\n\n\nThe people learned to fear their own sisters brothers and friends\n\n\nThey feared their own walls their own shadows their own whispered\nrejection of a regime so ignominious\n\n\nDo we not remember Trinidad Herrera\n\n\nShe protested against the inhumane demolition of  homes in the city\n\n\nShe was arrested\n\n\nShe was tortured\n\n\nShe was but one of the thousands broken by cigarette burns\near-popping water treatment beating strangulation scalding mid-air suspension\nsexual assault and

\n\n\nTogether we pray in our prayer in our recollection of recent\nhistory in our recollection of ominous events and confusing public statements\n\n\nWe bishops and faithful Catholics and Protestants believers in God\nand humanity discovered our common position\n\n\nWe were convinced that Charter Change at this time would be immoral\n\n\nIt would be self-serving and benefit primarily those who desired to\nstay in power beyond constitutional limits\n\n\nIt would divide the nation and distract from other pressing\nnational concerns\n\n\nIt would expose the Constitution to total change without

would lay down our lives\n\n\nWe prayed\n\n\nWe acted in the darkness of confusing official statements and\ncontradictory official actions\n\n\nWe feared the President of the Philippines was not with us\n\n\nWe feared he was sadly <unclear> 1 word </unclear> from the spirit\nwhich bonded us at EDSA and unified us in the ratification of the nineteen\neighty-seven Constitution\n\n\nWe feared we have been betrayed in our trust  \n\n\nThe President has declared that there will be elections in nineteen\nninety-eight  \n\n\nHe has declared he is not running in nineteen ninety-eight  \n\n\nHe has directed his party mates to shelve legislative moves for a\nconstituent assembly  \n\n\nHe has acknowledged that the people prefer a constitutional\nconvention after the nineteen ninety-eight

power peacefully\nto his elected successor\n\n\n That is why the Church is involved in this because if the\nelection is not clean and we touched the basic laws of our Constitution there\nwill be animosity in our country and the bishops would not like this to\nhappen\n\n\nTherefore we are trying to solve the problems of the country  \n\n\nIn the meantime as our President he will provide the

since the hundreds of\nthousands filled the streets around us\n\n\nHow quickly time has gone by\n\n\nHow do we remember EDSA this year\n\n\nLet us and let me reflect on the year of Jubilee and draw a few\nlines from it into our present moment\n\n\nThe Book of Leviticus has described a full Jubilee Year in these\nterms  during this year of the Lord 's favor all fields lie fallow\n\n\n Family members have the right to freedom to freedom family land\nto redeem family land that had been sold when the family was in dire need\n\n\nAll debts are remitted\n\n\nAll slaves are set free   \n\n\nThe Jubilee Year calls for a redirection of priorities in favor of\nthe poor\n\n\nChristian churches and other Bible-based groups have drawn up the\nagenda for this year summarized for us in the five Rs\n\n\nReturn of the land and other means of production to their original\nor rightful owners\n\n\nRecall of debts unjustly imposed on the poor\n\n\nThe release of prisoners those of course who no longer pose a\ngenuine threat to society\n\n\nRelease too of all those in contemporary  slave-like\nconditions\n\n\nRest for the earth and conservation of the natural environment\n\n\nAnd the restoration of harmony among women and men best in their\n\n respective roles rights and equal dignity\n\n\nAs Pope John Paul the second has told us the overall meaning of\nthe Jubilee Year was to call on the entire community to bring back the\noriginal harmony which God gave to his creation a harmony which human\nsinfulness human greed human blindness had damaged\n\n\nThe Jubilee Year reminds us that we are merely stewards of God 's\nplanning\n\n\nThe one world the one single haven we share is not ours it is a\ngift of God 's love\n\n\nSo during the Jubilee Year we must lift the burdens we have placed\non the backs of the poor the oppressed the excluded the weakest and most\npowerf powerless members of society\n\n\nThe Jubilee Year is meant to be a year of fostering hope so that\neveryone can share the hope of a new beginning of harmony within humanity and\nwith all of creation\n\n\nA new hope that the grand design of God is still possible of\nfulfillment within history\n\n\nEDSA nineteen eighty-six was in fact a Jubilee experience\n\n\nIt was a freeing of a nation long shackled by the ruinous\ndictatorship\n\n\nIt was setting the downtrodden free\n\n\nIt was giving broken ones new hope the blind new sight\n\n\nIt was resurrection for the poor who had been abused tortured\nsalvaged raped plundered slain\n\n\nIt was truly good news to the poor\n\n\nIt was God answering our prayers our pleas our cries and our tears\n\n\nNo one who was here for the jubilation of the night of February\ntwenty-fifth will ever forget the Lord has restored our land to us as He had\npromised\n\n\nWe need that experience of Jubilee again\n\n\nEDSA should not be reduced to an event in history when a people\ntoppled a dictator\n\n\nIt is rather a story of one entire nation winning the pursuit of\npeace through peaceful means\n\n\nEDSA gave us hope\n\n\nUnfortunately when we the so-called heroes of EDSA were already in\npower we we sort of enjoyed the power and played blind to the abuses of the\npost-EDSA years\n\n\nEDSA changed the personalities in nineteen eighty-six but this\ncorrupt system did not change\n\n\nWhen the victims of the dictatorship took on positions of power in\ngovernment we started to keep quiet in the face of abuses because we were now\nthe beneficiaries of the political favors\n\n\nThe poor of nineteen eighty-six are still poor\n\n\n Natapos na kayo kami naman  \n\n\nIt makes us and it makes me very sad to say this but humbly we\naccept that it is true\n\n\nEDSA is about change but not simply a change of persons but a\nchange within each person so that society can change\n\n\nWe do not want remembering EDSA this year to be an empty ceremony\njust show and speak\n\n\nThe Jubilee Year reminds us that God 's plan for human society\ncalls for us to try to construct here in our country some true anticipation\nof the world of freedom and justice solidarity and peace which is God 's\nkingdom for us\n\n\nAt bottom that is what EDSA was about that is what EDSA must be\nabout now\n\n\nTo us all Jesus addresses His mission statement to bring good news\nto the poor in an extraordinary way in this year of Jubilee\n\n\nOur present government was elected on the strength of that promise\nit would work for the poor\n\n\nLet the resolve we bring home thus this EDSA assembly this year of\nJubilee be that\n\n\nIt will be a year when our priority above all else will be to\nbring good news to the poor\n\n\nThe preferential option for the poor in our land must be the first\nof imperatives for all in this Jubilee Year so that this year will truly be\nthe year of the Lord 's favor\n\n\nThis is our resolve as we gather here in EDSA two thousand\n\n\nThis is our task as we go back to work to bring the spirit of EDSA\nto life and  live  once more\n\n\nIt is a task for everyone\n\n\nThis is what the Jubilee Year demands of us all\n\n\nGod is with us\n\n\nLet us go forward with him\n\n\nAmen\n\n\nGod bless you all\n\n\n Salamat po", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "be6903d5-1128-4737-b8e9-ad76a373493d", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\n\n Mr Chief Justice Your Honors twenty-nine months ago President Joseph Ejercito Estrada right hand raised left hand in the Bible took an oath the sacred vow before God and country  I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully and conscientiously fulfill my duties as President of the Philippines preserve and defend its Constitution and consecrate myself to the service of the nation so help me God  \n\n\nYour Honors Joseph Ejercito Estrada willfully  consciously and maliciously violated that sacred oath by his acts of committing bribery graft and corruption in all its forms betrayed public trust and culpably violated the Constitution\n\n\nI have been assigned together with Congressman Oscar Rodriguez to prove that respondent President Joseph Ejercito Estrada betrayed public trust\n\n\nToday Mr Chief Justice distinguished judges in this impeachment tribunal we write history \n\n Last November twenty-eight when this august body made a resounding denial of the defense motion to quash a significant page in history was written\n\n\nExpectations and hopes of our people were raised to the skies but it is in this trial where we will write whether or not in a thousand years the Senate will have its finest hour\n\n\nDuring these historic eventful days the Senate will have the singular privilege never tested in our nation 's history which hopefully future generations of Filipinos will read with pride that during the eleventh Congress the Senate in fulfillment of  constitutional duty rose to the occasion and guided only by duty and conscience and the truth left partisan loyalties behind in the side against the President\n\n\nYour Honors permit me to say that none of us in this hallowed hall relish the task before us\n\n\nBut we did not choose to be involved in such reckless and <unclear> word </unclear> misconduct as President Joseph Ejercito Estrada is accused\n\n\nIt is thus a duty be it painful one that I speak to Your Honors to find judgment against the President\n\n\nIndeed the impact to the Constitution must be felt that if the President commits any or all of the cited charges against him the Constitution and our people must be served\n\n\nHence we are today to do our respective duties we to present the case against the President and you to rule under your best lights \n\n Your Honors by voting these Articles of Impeachment the House of Representatives is not attempting to raise the standard of ethical conduct to perfection for our political leadership nay for all of us\n\n\nSuch person does not walk the earth today even after Jesus Christ redeemed mankind from original sin\n\n\nEveryone can sin but when the Constitution provided for impeachment as a mode of removal of the President it is our bounden duty to prove the President guilty and Your Honors to uphold that guilt as evidence will show\n\n\nIndeed the impeachment since the days of the English kings and ministers has been called the most powerful weapon in the political armory short of civil war\n\n\nIt played a continuing role in the struggles between King and Parliament that resulted in the formation of the unwritten English Constitution\n\n\nIn this respect impeachment was one of the tools used by the English Parliament to create more responsive and responsible government and to redress imbalances when these occur\n\n\nIn our jurisdiction we borrowed from the U S Constitution with some minor modifications are impeachment grounds \n\n In the U S the framers sought to create a responsible though strong executive\n\n\nThey hoped in the words of  Ellwoods Gerry  of Massachusetts that the maxim would never be adopted that the Chief Executive could never be wrong\n\n\nNo man is above the law and no man is below it\n\n\nNor do we ask any man 's permission when we require him to bring it\n\n\nObedience to to the law is demanded thus the maxim  ignorance alleges  non facit excusam   \n\n\nIn the case at bar the President took a solemn oath before God and country to uphold the law and preserve and defend the Constitution\n\n\nSection One Article Eleven of the Constitution states that public office is a public trust\n\n\nPublic officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people serve them with utmost responsibility integrity loyalty and efficiency act with patriotism and justice and lead modest lives\n\n\nIn many decisions of the Supreme Court it has been ruled that any government office is a trust, for it is created for the sole purpose of effecting the end for which government has been instituted which is for the common good and not for the profit honor or private interest of any man family or class  of being kin  \n\n\nJurisprudence adds that a public official employed therefore occupies a very delicate position which exacts from him certain standards which are not demanded from or required of ordinary citizens\n\n\nHe 's truly the servant of the people and as such he is enjoined to serve his office with the highest degree of responsibility integrity loyalty and efficiency and at all times be accountable to the people\n\n\nMr Chief Justice Your Honors we will prove to you by competent credible and relevant evidence that President Joseph Ejercito Estrada is guilty of betrayal of public trust \n\n has opined that betrayal of public trust covers any violation of oath of office involving loss in popular support even if the violation will not amount to a punishable offense \n\n Its inclusion is more a reaction to past experience than an exercise in logic\n\n\nIt was the  consensus in the Constitutional Commission that culpable violation of the Constitution as the main ground for impeachment would hardly prosper in Congress even against an unpopular President\n\n\nThis new ground \" betrayal of public trust \" serves to stress the desirableness of having a President who truly regards public office as a public trust\n\n\nHow has President Joseph Ejercito Estrada spent the fund of public trust\n\n\nWho benefited and who was deprived\n\n\nYour Honors we ask you to decide this case on the bases of law and the evidence\n\n\nWe ask you not to be swayed by the pomp and the power of the office or the political interests involved but to look at the evidence that will be presented and the magnitude of the betrayal in the public trust\n\n\nThe violation is very clear the evidence overwhelming in fact consistent corroborated and more than substantial\n\n\nThe defense constantly harps on the fact that the defendant is an elected public official or  vox populi in vox dei  \n\n But Mr Senate Mr Chief Justice Your Honors so did all the dictators of the world\n\n\nThe voice of the people is the voice of God\n\n\nYes\n\n\nBut that voice is also spoken in the Constitution\n\n\nThe Constitution is the expression of the people 's sovereign will\n\n\nThe Constitution lays down the framework of government the powers of the President the different branches of government and the limitations thereto and what is important the principles of accountability mandate and accountability power and public trust\n\n\nWhat the people make and elect they can unmake and remove through impeachment in conviction for the elected legislators in the mechanism set forth in the Constitution\n\n\nThe Constitution is supreme and the people 's voice sovereign\n\n\nMr Chief Justice Your Honors the  the prosecution shall show that President Joseph Ejercito Estrada has not cherished the public trust\n\n\nHe squandered it for his benefit and for the benefit of his cronies and kin\n\n\nPresident Joseph Ejercito Estrada has placed public interests private interests above the interests of the public in violation of that oath of office\n\n\nWe will present overwhelming detailed and corroborated evidence that on September six nineteen ninety-nine President Joseph Ejercito Estrada has ordered a quasi-judicial agency insulated by law from political pressure and influence not to perform its function in accordance with the law of its creation\n\n\nHe issued the directive to the Securities and Exchange Commission not to allow an independent department of that body, to conduct investigations without the prior clearance of the commission  en banc  \n\n For what ulterior purpose and for whose benefit this directive was issued was made apparent by subsequent events\n\n\nPresident Joseph Ejercito Estrada 's crony businessman Dante Tan became owner of controlling stocks of a corporation called B W Resources Corporation at the time when the shares of stock in the said company was undergoing a price surge never before seen in the history of the Philippine stock market\n\n\nOn January nineteen ninety-nine the price of B W shares was about two pesos per share\n\n\nBy October ten nineteen ninety-nine the price surged to a high one hundred seven pesos per share\n\n\nWhen Dante Tan first bought B W shares in nineteen ninety-eight its price was only eighty centavos per share\n\n\nB W shares rose from the sixteenth most heavily traded stock in the Philippine Stock Exchange in January nineteen ninety-nine to the number one among the top twenty companies by June with a total value turnover of seven billion one hundred thirty-nine million nine hundred seventy-two thousand one hundred seventy-five pesos\n\n\nLater the Philippine Stock Exchange would report that Dante Tan earned a profit of some eight hundred twenty million pesos during the period from January to May nineteen ninety-nine alone\n\n\nThe total value turnover of B W shares in October was twenty-one billion six hundred ninety million one hundred seventy-five thousand and seven hundred twenty-five pesos record that will never likely be surpassed decades into the future\n\n\nAfter October ten nineteen ninety-nine the prices of B W shares underwent an abrupt and ignominious fall \n\n\nLast one week from October ten B W shares had plunged to as low as twenty-two pesos per share and now very much lower\n\n\nThese dramatic events pertaining to trading of B W shares in the Philippine Stock Exchange alarmed responsible officials of that body as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission which oversees the former\n\n\nBoth bodies undertook their investigations which necessarily inquired on whether the meteoric rise and sudden fall in the prices of the shares was a natural occurrence dictated by market forces or was the result of illegal schemes or manipulation\n\n\nWhile these investigations were being carried out, by these agencies and in relation to the very subject of such investigation President Joseph Ejercito Estrada made several questionable phone calls to the heads of both agencies and made representations in favor of his crony Dante Tan\n\n\nThrough less than subtle suggestions the President applied pressure on the chiefs of the P S E and the SEC to shield Mr Dante Tan from any unfavorable findings that these agencies may come up with\n\n\nThe President would constantly remind his officers that Mr Dante Tan was a friend is my friend\n\n\nThe President clearly interfered with the discharge of the duties of these officials by suggesting by ordering that Mr Dante Tan be exonerated even as the investigations had yet to be finished\n\n\nWe have evidence to show Your Honors that the President ordered the president of the Stock Exchange that before the report of each investigation would be submitted to the board of governors the same should first be submitted to him\n\n\nAnd we have proof to show that indeed the president of the Stock Exchange and, the head of the investigating agency were called to Malaca&ntilde;ang to present the advance report of that investigation\n\n\nWhen the investigations were concluded the reports had one clear conclusion\n\n\nAll evidence that the P S E and SEC gathered had pointed to the culpability of Mr Dante Tan for price manipulation and insider trading\n\n\nPresident Joseph Ejercito Estrada said Dante Tan was a victim\n\n\nThe evidence said Dante Tan was the culprit\n\n\nThe investigators found that illegal transactions involving Dante Tan were committed not once not twice not thrice but hundreds and thousands of times in myriad forms and ways\n\n\nIt is in the interest of the public to bring Dante Tan to court and make him face the rigors of trial\n\n\nThe President showed interest in Dante Tan 's immediate exoneration and obstructed the course of justice\n\n\nWhy \n\n Did he have as evidence seems to suggest more than friendship with Mr Dante Tan but has pecuniary interests in B W shares which went beyond mere cronyism\n\n\nThe prosecution will show that the President 's interference did impair the course of justice despite the fact that the evidence against Dante Tan surfaced in the report\n\n\nIt would be noted that both the P S E and the SEC reports were partially incomplete in the sense that the reports didn't cover all individuals and persons who had been involved in illegal transactions or benefited therefrom\n\n\nThe President 's obstruction of justice prospered because he succeeded in cutting short the investigations \n\n\nIn striking fear in SEC and P S E officials he succeeded in confining the reports to incomplete results\n\n\nHe succeeded in having possible damning evidence against the President mistress Guia Gomez his favorite son J V Ejercito and his other friends and relatives obstructed\n\n\nThe denials of officials willing under the awesome demonstration of coercive power weighed at a time when the President appeared omnipotent hardly qualifies as evidence of lack of pressure\n\n\nMr Chief Justice and honorable judges it must be remembered that many traders in the stock market are small businessmen and ordinary people in a country where majority of the people live in abject poverty while a small middle class struggle to survive allowing the few to amass billions of pesos in profits through  manipulative schemes further widens the disparities the few rich and the many poor and the middle class <unclear> 1 word </unclear> \n\n\nThe facts we will prove before Your Honors pertaining to President Joseph Estrada 's interference in the affairs of the stock market do not even come close to the gravity and extent of the issues being raised by the workers and peasants and the protesters outside these halls\n\n\nPrice manipulations and insider trading fraud seem sophisticated and technical when compared with joblessness hunger and displacement from farmlands all concrete symptoms of a deep crisis that the President exacerbates by staying in office and imposing himself upon a people who has withdrawn confidence in his administration and policies\n\n\nAnd what is worst Your Honors there now appears substantive proof that respondent President Joseph Ejercito Estrada did not only pressure the SEC and the P S E to clear his crony Dante Tan but violated his own memorandum to government financial institutions not to approve or release loan applications in excess of fifty million without his without his prior imprimatur \n\n huge six

{"text": "<$A> \n\nMay it please the Honorable Chief Justice and the honorable\nmembers of the impeachment tribunal, I will take only, five minutes or\nso simply to draw attention to certain legal propositions which I take to be\nrelevant to the controversy at bar and certain political dimensions attending\nthe same\n\n\nAnd I will do this by way of laying the predicate for the\npresentation in chief of former Solicitor-General Mendoza my esteemed\ncolleague\n\n\nMany of us here present will doubtless recall the story of a man of\nancient Rome named Julius Caesar whom the masses admired and wanted to be the\nhead of their nation\n\n\nHe was assassinated by a group of plotters who considered him unfit\nto rule\n\n\nThose plotters by spreading rumor and gossip had poisoned the minds\nof the people against him\n\n\nThey said Julius Caesar was ambitious avaricious corrupt and they\nenlisted the aid of well-meaning citizens like the noble-minded Brutus who\nwas deluded into believing the sly insinuations of the plotters and had thus\ncome to think that Caesar was indeed unfit to rule\n\n\nAnd so Julius Caesar was slain\n\n\nCaesar 's friend Mark Antony having learned of the conspiracy and\nhow easily the people had been made to believe the lies and innuendoes of the\nconspirators was moved to cry out as he mourned Caesar 's death  Oh\njudgment thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason\n\n \n\n\nToday two thousand years after that tragic event we take part in\nthese impeachment proceedings to pass judgment on another leader Joseph\nEjercito Estrada a man also admired by his countrymen who had elected him by\nan overwhelming majority to the highest office of the land\n\n\nWe are here to determine whether he should continue to lead the\nnation as its President\n\n\nBut unlike in Julius Caesar 's case we are assured that in this\nforum judgment will not flee to brutish beasts and reason will not be lost\nbut will attend every aspect and incident of these proceedings\n\n\nFor in the many centuries that have passed from Julius Caesar 's\ntime to ours principles and tenets have developed and come to be engraved in\nevery enlightened society foremost among which is that the guilt or innocence\nof a person accused of some wrong shall be determined not by passion or\nprejudice nor hearsay or rumor but by such evidence as the universal\nexperience of mankind accepts as satisfactory proof of facts presented in\naccordance with procedures that best conduce to full and free ventilation of\na controversy and ultimately to a fair and honest judgment\n\n\nIt is our good fortune that in the course of time and in the full\nfruition of human wisdom definite rules and standards for conducting trials\nand hearings as well as for determining all questions of evidence including\nquestions of its materiality relevancy competency have been formulated and\nmet with general acceptance in democratic states and that these specific\nnorms have been adopted in our country\n\n\nIt is our good fortune that this country of ours is governed by a\nConstitution and a set of laws that guarantee to every person the fundamental\nright to due process and other inviolable human rights and otherwise command\nfull commitment to the rule of law\n\n\nIt is in light of these familiar norms and precepts which we are\ncertain this honorable impeachment tribunal will uphold and apply that the\nrespondent the President of the Philippines now confidently faces his\naccusers\n\n\nBy your leave and with many thanks for your kind attention I now\nask my colleague Atty Estelito P Mendoza to outline the case for the\nrespondent  \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nMr President my fellow Senators Prime Minister Indira Gandhi\nof India once said  You cannot shake hands with clenched fist  \n\n\nThe issue of the V F A or the Visiting Forces Agreement boils down\nto whether it is in our country 's interest to continue its good working\nrelations with the United States on the matter of defense and security\n\n\nHow each of us will cast our vote will send a clear signal whether\nor not we as a people have set aside and put behind us the emotions and hurt\nthat were felt during the nineteen ninety-one Military Bases debates\n\n\nAre we now ready with maturity objectivity to address our present\nand future security needs as a democratic society in partnership with another\ndemocratic society\n\n\nDecision-making involves more than the inputs of the debates we\nhave gone through though they have helped us gain viable knowledge from my\nexperience and  profound colleagues  as elected officials seek the\nopinion of the people whom we respect and we serve\n\n\nMore often the inclination of society would be a good basis to\nstart the process\n\n\nDecision-making requires a broader perspective\n\n\nThat is why we had the Plaza Miranda during the nineteen fifties\nthat is why we have the respected Social Weather Stations surveys and other\npolling groups of our generation to enable us to listen to and appreciate\nsocial and political issues\n\n\n Vox populi vox dei  \n\n\nOur democratic society dictates that the voice of our people the\nsilent majority the average Filipino the ordinary Juan should serve as the\nlight that would guide our path in arriving at a decision such as this\n\n\nA recent survey by the S W S gives us some enlightenment on the\nreal sentiments of our fellow Filipinos\n\n\nAccording to the survey conducted from March one to nineteen this\nyear more than half or fifty percent fifty-six percent of the respondents\nstrongly feel that the Mutual Defense Treaty of nineteen fifty-one with the\nUnited States is still appropriate\n\n\nFurthermore eighty percent of the pro-Mutual Defense Treaty\nrespondents approved of the visits of the American forces to the Philippines\nfor joint military exercises\n\n\nThese statistics indicate that the V F A has gained more popular\nsupport since it became a vital national security issue in the light of\nrecent regional security concerns\n\n\nOur country has been host to a number of similar although low\nprofile visits by Armed Forces personnel of other countries especially those\nof our ASEAN friends\n\n\nWe have not heard any objections to such visits\n\n\nBut now that the President President Estrada and his administration\nseek Senate approval for such a simple request to strengthen our external\ndefense we hear many oppositions\n\n\nWe find nothing wrong with this as it is the democratic way and\nfreedom of expression truly works well in our society\n\n\nThe American society is not a stranger to us Filipinos\n\n\nI do not wish to delve into the issue of how and why almost two\npoint five million Filipinos have migrated to North America during the\ngreater part of this waning century nor should I again state that our country\ntops all other Asian countries in the number of immigrants to the U S every\nyear\n\n\nMay I digress briefly to read into the record that in our own\ncountry in our trade and commerce that the Philippines benefits from trade\nwith the United States\n\n\nLet me read into the record also that the U S is the  top export market\n\n\nIn nineteen ninety-eight last year the U S bought thirty-four\npercent of the total Philippine exports to the whole globe more than double\nwhat Japan bought from us with Japan 's share at fifteen percent or less than\nhalf\n\n\nFor nineteen ninety-eight the Philippine surplus with the U S\ntotaled five point two billion dollars\n\n\nThat 's the trade surplus that means in our favor\n\n\nThat 's much higher than in nineteen ninety-seven surplus of three\nbillion dollars\n\n\nThis demonstrates that the Philippines continues to be a very\nsuccessful competitor in the world 's most competitive market and that is the\nUnited States\n\n\nThe five point two billion dollars trade deficit the U S had with\nthe Philippines in nineteen ninety-eight is our thirteenth largest bilateral\ntrade deficit up from sixteenth in nineteen ninety-seven\n\n\nBy comparison the U S deficit with Malaysia ranked number eight\nThailand number nine and Indonesia number eleven\n\n\nThe Philippines ranks in fourteenth place as a supplier of U S\nimports ahead of Hong Kong Indonesia Brazil and all European countries except\nGermany the United Kingdom Italy and France\n\n\nPhilippine exports to the U S are growing much faster than\nPhilippine exports to Japan\n\n\nIn nineteen ninety-eight Philippine exports to the U S were up over\nsixteen percent compared to the same period in nineteen ninety-seven\n\n\nBy contrast exports to Japan from the Philippines were up only\nthree percent as against sixteen percent to the U S\n\n\nHigh tariffs in Japan are barriers to important Philippine exports\nsuch as fish and forest products\n\n\nLet me also Mr President read to the record of Filipinos who have\nmade a successful entry into U S politics\n\n\nOf course among these we know that the nephew of our colleague here\nSenator Tito Guingona Michael Guingona was Mayor of Daly City I think until\nlast year\n\n\nI think Michael Guingona was born in the Philippines grew up in the\nPhilippines and went to the U S and became Mayor of Daly City the  \nPinoy  town in uh outside of San Francisco\n\n\nThen we had the Governor Benjamin Cayetano of Hawaii the State\nSenator Robert Bunda State Legislator of Hawaii and then Lorraine Inouye\nState Legislator of Hawaii\n\n\nThen we have the State Representatives John Amores he must be from\nZambales State Legislator of Werst West Virginia David Valderama of Maryland\nVilma Viloria of Washington Ron Menor of Hawaii and some others\n\n\nPete Fajardo Mayor of Carlson City California Henry Manayan Mayor\nMilpitas California Teresita Santiago must be a niece of uh Miriam\nDefensor-Santiago of Delano California Joventino Fajardo Glendale Heights\nIllinois and various city councilors\n\n\nI 'm mentioning these Mr President because it shows you what kind\nof society the United States is\n\n\nIt is a society of immigrants\n\n\nIt allows even foreign-born but already U S citizens to run for\npublic office and this doesn't happen here\n\n\nAlso Mr President in terms of manufacturing in the Philippines\nthere is a report by the American Chamber of Commerce as of nineteen\nninety-seven the multinational companies contributed one hundred sixty-four\nbillion pesos to the Philippine economy and had forty-five thousand three\nhundred eighty-four employees each with an average annual income of three\nhundred seventy thousand pesos\n\n\nNow of course these are just words you can say\n\n\nBut what is the problem of the country Mr President\n\n\nIt 's economic\n\n\nThere are so many poor people in this country\n\n\nMaybe that 's why people are going all over the place and just\ndoing their demo because they have nothing better to do\n\n\nBut we cannot hold that against them it 's part of democracy\n\n\nThe  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas  reported that U S\nbased Filipinos continue to remit annually the largest amount of dollars from\noverseas helping to prop up our Gross National Product to respectable levels\n\n\nIn global trade as I mentioned earlier we continue to ship\nthirty-four percent of our exports to America\n\n\nOur fellow Filipinos have likewise found their place in the United\nStates Armed Forces\n\n\nThere are currently ten thousand Filipinos in the Armed Forces of\nthe United States\n\n\nAnd right here in our own country seven thousand Filipino U S\nveterans have retired in their own old country\n\n\nIn the field of higher education many of  of our\nelected and appointed officials received their training in that country of\nmany opportunities\n\n\nDespite occasional strains and stresses Mr President which after\nall are present in all basic relationships our two countries continue to\nmanage good working relations with each other\n\n\nWhy then can't we keep a positive attitude and confidence in our\nown future\n\n\nWhy do we choose to nurture our imaginary fears and pessimisms\n\n\nLet us give our officials in the Executive Department headed by our\nPresident and the Cabinet the opportunity to protect and preserve the\nsovereignty of our people\n\n\nI know all of them will rise to this great challenge\n\n\nAlliances and strategic partnerships are the way to go as we enter\nthe new century\n\n\nCountries that reject this policy will be the have-nots of the\ntwenty-first century\n\n\nAnd finally Mr President I vote strongly \" yes \" \nfor the approval of the V F A knowing that a strong regional alliance with\nother democratic countries anchored on interdependence will signal our firm\ndetermination to preserve peace and security in our region\n\n\nThank you\n\n\n Mabuhay ang ating bayan", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

President of the Republic of the\nPhilippines with the nation the world and God as my witness do hereby\nreaffirm my unwavering commitment to democracy  \n\n\nI stand by my solemn oath to defend the Constitution\n\n\nAs President I will always uphold freedom in all its various forms\nincluding the freedom of speech of the press of worship of assembly and of\nchoice\n\n\n  None of these freedoms are under\nthreat\n\n\nThose who fear the loss of freedom do not share my faith in the\nstrength of our Constitution in the sturdiness of our institutions in the\npassion of our people to preserve their freedom and in their determination\nand power to defend it\n\n\nFreedom may have been lost before it will never be lost again  \n\n\nOur people will see to that\n\n\nI as President will stake my own life on it\n\n\nYet  yet may I remind our people that liberty\nwithout responsibility is license that freedom does not confer the right to\nviolate the law or the rights of others that freedom without responsibility\nis a formula for chaos anarchy and lawlessness\n\n\nThe paranoid will take that last statement as a hidden threat\n\n\nThe rest will see it as a self-evident principle accepted\nthroughout the ages and needing neither apology nor defense\n\n\nYet given a choice between freedom and restraint I will choose to\nerr on the side of freedom  \n\n\nTo paraphrase Voltaire I may not agree with what you say but I will\ndefend to to the death your right to say it but that does not mean I waive\nthe right to argue with you\n\n\nThat is as much my constitutional right as it is yours\n\n\nLet all doubts be erased democracy freedom and the Constitution are\nalive and well in this country  \n\n\nNow to other issues\n\n\nAlthough I am blessed with many friends I have no cronies  \n\n\nI have turned down and will continue to turn down all requests for\na government bailout of financially-strapped companies as I did in the case\nof Philippine Airlines owned by Mr Lucio Tan  \n\n\nThe sequestered shares of Mr Eduardo Cojuangco Jr in San Miguel\nCorporation are under litigation and will stay as such until the case is\nresolved\n\n\nThere is no deal involved here with Mr Cojuangco\n\n\nThe extradition process involving Mr Mark Jimenez will proceed in\naccordance with due process of law without obstruction\n\n\nThere are no secret deals with the Marcoses\n\n\nI hope this answers your immediate concerns  \n\n\nToday I fulfill my constitutional mandate to address Congress on\nthe first day of its regular session\n\n\nBy tradition I am to dwell on the state of the nation\n\n\nLet me start with a sincere apology to all those who expected or\nwished to see me fail\n\n\nI 'm sorry to disappoint them  \n\n\nI am pleased to report that our nation is rising growing and\nstrengthening\n\n\nThis is in contrast to the situation I described to you last year\nand which I vowed to reverse  \n\n\nLast year when I first addressed this august body our nation was in\nan economic crisis\n\n\nToday we are out of it\n\n\nLast year I told you that our aim was to help the country escape\nthe recession\n\n\nWe did it\n\n\nIn nineteen ninety-eight most of our Asian neighbors sank into\nrecession\n\n\nIn contrast our country managed a modest but positive growth of\none-tenth of one percent in our Gross National Product\n\n\nHowever our Gross Domestic Product dipped by one-half percent or\npoints or zero point five during the year\n\n\nIn the first quarter of this year our G N P abruptly surged upward\nby two percent and our G D P by one point two percent\n\n\nLast year we were struggling to keep ourselves from sinking\n\n\nToday we are sailing towards the high seas again\n\n\nIt is time once more to pay tribute to a special class of Filipinos\nour overseas workers\n\n\nThey as a group kept our G N P growth at positive rates even during\nthe worst of times\n\n\nThey continue to be our economic saviors\n\n\nLast year I expressed my hope of keeping inflation at a\nsingle-digit rate\n\n\nWe did it\n\n\nIn nineteen ninety-eight the inflation rate was at a full-year  average of nine point seven percent\n\n\nIt improved further to a six-month average of eight point four\npercent in the first half of nineteen ninety-nine\n\n\nIn June alone inflation was down to five point eight percent\n\n\nInflation is a vicious enemy of the poor\n\n\nLast year I said that without undermining the independence of the\n\n Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas  we would support the lowering of\ninterest rates\n\n\nWe did it\n\n\nIn the past twelve-months period alone the benchmark ninety-one day\ntreasury-bill rate dropped steeply from fourteen point nine percent on the\nfirst auction on July six nineteen ninety-eight to eight point four percent\nlast Monday\n\n\nThis is its lowest level in more than twelve years\n\n\nBank lending rates have also dropped to pre-crisis levels\n\n\nLast year I lamented the devaluation of the peso as imposing\nburdens on our people\n\n\nI inferred that we should strengthen our currency\n\n\nWe did it\n\n\nAt the beginning of nineteen ninety-eight the peso plunged to an\nall time low of forty-five pesos and forty-two centavos to one dollar\n\n\nAt the beginning of my administration it was at forty-two pesos and\nfour centavos\n\n\nSince then the peso has strengthened dramatically\n\n\nIt has stabilized within a range of thirty-seven to thirty-nine to\nthe dollar\n\n\nThis was achieved largely by leaving the market alone and the\nmarket responded with a show of confidence it sent billions of dollars of\nloans investments and exports orders to the Philippines\n\n\nThe  Bangko Sentral  intervened only occasionally to\nprevent wild swings and to forestall speculative attacks not to set the\ntrends of or levels of the exchange rate\n\n\nLast year I committed to more effective and efficient tax\ncollection\n\n\nWe did it\n\n\nDespite the ravages of the Asian crisis on tax collections total\nrevenues amounted to four hundred sixty-two billion in nineteen ninety-eight\nof which tax revenues constituted four hundred sixteen billion or four\nbillion pesos higher than in nineteen ninety-seven\n\n\nFor the first  for the first four months of nineteen\nninety uh nine nineteen ninety-nine B I R collection reached one hundred\ntwenty-six billion or three point two percent higher than in nineteen\nninety-eight\n\n\nCustom collections amounted to twenty-three point one billion pesos\nand non-tax revenue fourteen point one billion pesos\n\n\nThis does not mean that we are happy with our tax   effort\n\n\nWe need to improve not only our collection performance but the tax\nstructure itself and hence our existing tax laws\n\n\nLast year we found the government in a deeper fiscal hole than the\npublic had been made to believe\n\n\nWe committed to reduce the government deficit\n\n\nThis time we didn't do it\n\n\nIt is not that we failed\n\n\nWe deliberately shifted shifted course\n\n\nAt a time when the economy was threatened by recession uh the\nadministration has decided on a twenty-five percent across-the-board forced\nsavings on the expenditures of the government\n\n\nThis was like administering the medicine for high blood pressure to\na patient with low blood pressure\n\n\n  Lalong lulubha ang pasyente dahil baka mamatay nang di\npa oras  \n\n\nThat is why my favorite doctor the First Lady always makes sure\nthat my blood pressure is normal especially when I 'm reading the newspapers\n\n \n\n\nWe scrapped the forced cutbacks and did exactly the opposite\n\n\nWe not only ensured that public services would continue at adequate\nlevels\n\n\nWe also engaged in various pump-priming\n\n\nOur aim was not to save but to spend\n\n\nThis was to counteract the slowdown in private consumption and\ninvestment expenditures in other words to raise the country 's declining\nblood pressure rather than let it sink further\n\n\nOur logic was simple\n\n\nA time of growth and threats of inflation calls for balanced\nbudgets or surpluses to prevent further inflation\n\n\nBut a time of recession and deflation calls for budget  \ndeficits to jump-start a recovery\n\n\nThus towards the end of nineteen ninety-eight we increased the\nbudget deficit to fifty billion or one point eight percent of the G N P\n\n\nFor the first time and for the first five months of nineteen\nninety-nine we incurred as planned a deficit of forty-five point three\nbillion pesos still within the nineteen ninety-nine program deficit of\nsixty-eight point four billion pesos or two point two percent of target G N P\n\n\nFor the next two years we intend to reduce our deficit to one point\none percent and zero point four percent of G N P and eventually attain a\nbalanced budget in the year two thousand two and surpluses thereafter\n\n\nIn other words I will not end my term with a deficit  \n\n\nOne problem we faced was how to finance the deficit\n\n\nBorrowing locally would have raised interest rates at a time when\nwe wanted them to go down\n\n\nBorrowing abroad was too costly\n\n\nMonetary expansion would have triggered inflation and a run on the\npeso\n\n\nForeign exchange controls were untenable\n\n\nRaising taxes or cutting government expenditures would have led to\na deep recession\n\n\nIt seemed like there was no way out\n\n\nBut we found one anyway\n\n\nSubstantial funds were located right under our noses the foreign\ncurrency deposit  units or F C D Us so we borrowed from them on a\nshort term basis at relatively low cost\n\n\nAs a result we brought down interest rates\n\n\nWe brought down the inflation rate\n\n\nAnd we strengthened the peso\n\n\nExperts say these all cannot happen at the same time because they\nare inconsistent with one another\n\n\nBut we did it\n\n\nAnd we emerged out of the regional crisis ahead of most our of our\nneighbors\n\n\nI narrate all these inside stories to make a point\n\n\nThose who make a career and a business out of hitting me are\nsaying that the improvement in the country 's economic performance was due to\npure luck to good weather or to anything but  Erap    \n\n\nOur recovery was due to the innovative way we analyzed situations\nand made bold decisions\n\n\nOur success was the result of effective governance\n\n\nIt was a matter of having the right policies being supported by\ncompetent and dedicated cabinet members respecting the freedom of the market\nmanaging and budgeting our resource  right and acting quickly\nbefore the danger grew out or the opportunity disappear\n\n\nAs a prominent Filipino economist Dr  Bernardo\nVillegas recently wrote and I quote  The economic team of the present\nadministration during its first year has been superior in cohesiveness\neffectiveness and clarity in purpose when compared to the equivalent teams\nduring the first years of the previous administrations  \n\n\n With due respect to the President, Ramos I didn't say this\n\n \n\n\n President Estrada 's first economic team is among the best\nin Asia  \n\n\nEffective governance by a team-powered administration also\nexplains the rapid recovery of the country 's international credit standing\n\n\nAnd I assure you that you know the definition of a banker\n\n\nHe is a person who lends you his umbrella when it stops raining\n\n\nCredit markets are even more jittery\n\n\nSo when the global market gobbles up one point two billion worth\nof  worth of the Republic of the Philippines global bonds for\nbudget support from the first  country to float such an issue\nafter the Asian crisis and when the market buys up the four hundred million\ndollars of  Bangko Sentral  bonds issued for reserve\nmanagement purposes and when the Eurobond flotation of the national\ngovernment raises three hundred eighty-three million dollars obviously the\nworld believes that in the Philippines it has stopped raining\n\n\nWe are getting a shower of umbrellas\n\n\nThis is not to mention the billions of dollars of inflows in\nmedium and long term loans from bilateral sources banks and financial\ninstitutions from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank from Japan 's\nExport-Import bank and Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and from the\nMonetary Fund among others  \n\n\nIn the meantime our exports are zooming up at double-digit rates\n\n\nOur balance of current accounts are in surplus and our gross\ninternational reserves are at all-time high currently amounting to fourteen\nbillion U S dollars\n\n\nWith all these developments it is no wonder that in the space of\nonly one year the other Asian countries and indeed much of the world have\ncome to recognize the presidency of the Philippines as among the leaders of\nthe region\n\n\nThis is indeed a long way from the skepticism that  \ngreeted this presidency when it began\n\n\nIn APEC in ASEAN and in other regional international forums the\ncurrent leadership of the Philippines enjoys a high level of respect\n\n\nOur international prestige is on the rise\n\n\nThe dramatic rebound in the stock market is a strong indication of\nconfidence and the people according to the latest surveys give the President\na seventy-seven point six percent approval rating\n\n\nThe heads of the I M F and the World Bank also have a have had\ngood words to say\n\n\nMr James Wolfenson president of the World Bank said and I quote\n\n What is clear is the Philippine situation is vastly different from\nKorea Thailand and Indonesia\n\n\n I think you all know you are weakened far less than anyone\nelse in the region with the exception of Singapore   end of quote\n\n\nAnd Mr Michel Camdessus managing director of the I M F said he\nconsidered the Philippines as a model for countries in the ASEAN region\n\n\nOnly last Thursday the I M F executive board completed the fourth\nreview under our standby arrangement\n\n\nThis will now allow us to draw about two hundred fourteen million\ndollars which will further increase our gross international reserves\n\n\nThe I M F executive directors also praised the  Bangko\nSentral  headed by Governor Gabriel Singson for the successful\nimplementation of monetary policy through the turbulence of the past two\nyears\n\n\nIt is ironic that while foreign experts and the foreign press have\ngood reviews of our performance and while investors pour money into our\neconomy some quarters in our local media are undermining confidence in our\ncountry", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

Your Excellencies of the diplomatic corps fellow workers in government, honored guests  minamahal kong mga kababayan  , \n\n\nIn March nineteen seventy-three six months after the declaration of Martial Law Ninoy Aquino was taken blindfolded from Fort Bonifacio and brought to a place he did not know, \n\n\nHe was stripped naked and thrown into a cell\n\n\nHis only human contact was a jailer\n\n\nThe immediate prospect in such a place was a midnight execution in front of a grave dug by himself, \n\n\nThe purpose was as clear as it was diabolical it was not to kill him yet but to break him first and with him break the compelling proof that men can stand up to a dictatorship\n\n\nHe came close to giving up he told me\n\n\nHe slipped in and out of despair but a power that must have been God held him together\n\n\nHe remembered the words of the epistle  God chose the weak to confound the strong  \n\n\nOn the third anniversary of his incarceration in Laur the recollection of his pain gave birth to a poem of hope\n\n\nThis is the poem he wrote  I am burning the candle of my life in the dark with no one to benefit from the light\n\n\n\n The candle slowly melts away soon its wick will be burned out and the light is gone\n\n\nIf someone will only gather the melted wax reshape it give it a new wick for another fleeting moment my candle can once again light the dark be of service one more time and then goodbye    \n\n\nThis is the anguish of good men that the good they do will come to nothing that pains suffered in obscurity or sacrifices made away from the sight of men amount to the same and mock the man or woman who bears them\n\n\nMr Senate President Mr Speaker members of the Congress distinguished guests my countrymen that is not true \n\n None of the good that we do is ever lost not even the light in an empty room is wasted\n\n\nFrom Ninoy 's burnt-out candle and thousands like it in cells throughout the garrison state we gathered the melted wax and made more candles to burn not as long in such loneliness but much more brightly altogether as to banish the darkness and light us to a new day\n\n\nYou might ask when will the President stop invoking Ninoy 's name\n\n\nMy answer is when the President stands here other than by Ninoy 's grace\n\n\nAnd not while gratitude is nourished by memory not while we acknowledge that it was his sacrifice that gave us back our freedom and restored the freely elected office whose incumbent must stand every year in this place\n\n\nFive years have passed my term is ending and so is yours\n\n\nAs we came so should we go with grateful acknowledgment to the man who made it possible for us to be here a man who discovered hope in the starkest despair and has something yet to teach a country facing adversity again\n\n\nIt would be foolish to ignore what is staring us in the face\n\n\nOur march of progress brought us far but such misfortunes have come upon us as to make us feel that we are not much farther from where we started\n\n\nThe eruption of Mount Pinatubo is the biggest in this century\n\n\nAbroad its effect is so far-reaching as to lower the temperature of the earth\n\n\nAt home it is so devastating it knocked off eighty thousand productive hectares from our agriculture and destroyed the commerce of at least three provinces\n\n\nHundreds of thousands were driven from their homes and livelihoods and thrown on the kindness of relatives and countrymen and on the solicitude of the state\n\n\nIt was an event so powerful it wiped out the largest military base in the Pacific and changed the nature of our relationship with an old ally\n\n\nIn the wake of the volcanic eruption more has been revealed about that relationship than was covered by its ash, \n\n\nBefore Pinatubo there was the typhoon that cut a wide swath of destruction across the southern regions\n\n\nAnd before that was the killer quake that cut off the northern parts of the country destroying billions of pesos in infrastructure causing the loss of billions more in foregone economic activities\n\n\nIt leveled the City of Pines and buried children in the rubble of yet another city\n\n\nBut those natural calamities were preceded by another entirely the work of human hands the massive December nineteen eighty-nine military revolt that cut short a second economic recovery after the dislocation caused by the earlier August nineteen eighty-seven coup attempt\n\n\nThat one strangled the powerful rebound of the Philippine economy after the EDSA Revolution, \n\n\nI mention these calamities not to excuse the perceived shortcomings of my administration nor to brag about my indestructibility\n\n\nI mention them so that we know where we are and why we are here and the exact requirements of the task to build up this country yet again\n\n\nI mention them because I will compare them with what we had and lost\n\n\nAnd then I will ask was it all in vain and I will answer it was not no more than a hero 's life is wasted, \n\n\nBy nineteen eighty-five the economy had contracted considerably\n\n\nIts rate of growth had been negative for two consecutive years\n\n\nThe country was at a standstill as if waiting only for the last rites to be performed\n\n\nBy nineteen eighty-six we had turned the economy around in less than a year\n\n\nWe improved on that performance the year after\n\n\nThe rate of unemployment was reduced\n\n\nThe volume of new investments significantly increased\n\n\nNew industrial projects were introduced \n\n Hitherto idle industrial capacity was fully utilized\n\n\nThe foundation of new regional industrial zones was laid\n\n\nPublic infrastructure and services strained under the load of expanding economic activity, \n\n\nI mention this not to offset the shortcomings of the present with the achievements of the past\n\n\nI mention it to show what can be done in such a short time and how much improvement was made from conditions far worse than what we have today the dictator 's apologies notwithstanding that the country is worse off now than when he and his wife were stealing the country blind\n\n\nThis progress was cut off by the August eighty-seven coup attempt\n\n\nBut the economy quickly rallied and in two years recovered a great deal of the ground we had lost\n\n\nWe were on the verge of a second take-off when the December nineteen eighty-nine coup broke out\n\n\nIt drained the last drop of confidence in our future from all but the hardiest spirits and shattered our image abroad, \n\n\nStill we persevered achieving gains that admittedly continue to fall short of the galloping needs of a fast growing population but real gains nonetheless\n\n\nImproved health care increased housing and one of the proudest achievements we share with the legislature free secondary education\n\n\nSix hundred sixty-thousand youth immediately availed themselves of it\n\n\nAnother two hundred thousand private school students received scholarship grants under another recent law\n\n\nEighty thousand new classrooms have been built\n\n\nThe first preparation of the nation for the future of economic competition which will take place in the highly educated minds of the youth\n\n\nWe have made the first serious effort to arrest environmental degradation already so far advanced in the previous regime that it set up an agency that did nothing about it anyway\n\n\nWe have pushed agrarian reform beyond the point of no return almost completing its coverage of rice and corn\n\n\nIts extension to other agricultural activities is proceeding at a pace consistent with our resolve to achieve for the farmer the prosperity promised by agrarian reform and not just its bare legal implementation\n\n\nIndeed we started to make up our losses and kept on going through the Gulf crisis which doubled the price of energy and introduced the element of a tremendous uncertainty not only about our economy but that of the world as well\n\n\nYou might ask having lost so much so easily what was the worth of all that effort\n\n\nWith such reversals of fortune is progress for our country a hope in vain\n\n\nPaul says that suffering produces perseverance perseverance character and character hope\n\n\nThe good we do is never lost some of it remains if not in material goods then in a deeper experience a more practiced hand and a spirit made stronger by that which failed to break it stronger to meet greater challenges ahead\n\n\nBut in one thing we grew from strength to strength in the enlargement of our democratic space and the strengthening of our democracy\n\n\nEvery calamity tested the capacity of democracy to absorb distress find relief and meet the absolute necessities of the people without the least curtailment of freedom or compromise of rights\n\n\nAgainst our economic gains that are ever hostages to fortune stands one steadfast unalloyed achievement our democracy destined I believe to outlive our problems and deck with the graces of liberty the material progress of our future\n\n\nThat achievement is better seen from the disinterested distance of foreign admirers than from the myopic view of those at home who wish to destroy it  \n\n\nIt is an achievement entirely in our power to preserve and enhance\n\n\nVisitors from the new Germany asked me what things strengthen democracy\n\n\nEconomic progress naturally I said but the attainment of that depends on external factors more than on the will of a developing country\n\n\nBut there is a way to strengthen democracy that is within any country 's reach that is through the empowerment of the people\n\n\nThis is obvious to a government like ours that came to power by its means as well as to a people like the Germans who attained complete freedom in the same way\n\n\nBut empowering the people means more than just giving them elections every three years\n\n\nIt means enlarging their contact with government beyond elections to its daily workings so that the vast resources of one support the initiatives of the other and the policies of government are refined by the insights of the people\n\n\n\n   Ngunit ang pagkaloob ng kapangyarihan sa mamamayan ay nangangahulugan hindi lamang ng pagdaraos ng halalan tuwing ikatlong taon \n\n \n\n\nBy these means the lives of the people shall be constantly improved and the people themselves empowered by the habit of directing their own government\n\n\nThe constant revision of flawed policies and the wider application of good ones are possible only by bringing together the people and the government\n\n\nPeople empowerment through people 's organizations N G Os foundations and cooperatives is the surest means we know to make government mirror the aspirations of the people  \n\n\nIn the past the idea was to give the people just enough power to elect their mistakes and suffer the consequences until the next elections\n\n\nElections were a safety valve\n\n\nWe want elections to be just one of other more effective means to bring the people into government and government to the people to make it truly a participatory democracy\n\n\nThis is the only way to end the character of total war that elections have assumed where the aim is the division of spoils and the victims are not just the losers but those who voted for them too\n\n\nSuch elections are like Russian roulette where your chances are five to one your life will not improve and one to five you will blow out your brains\n\n\nParticipatory democracy will end the practice of punishing provinces and municipalities for the wrong vote in the last poll\n\n\nIt will separate elections where the people vote for their favorites from the provision of public service which every Filipino has a right to expect from the government regardless how he voted, \n\n\nThis administration has made large steps in that direction\n\n\nTo the disappointment of those who marched with me against the Marcos regime my administration has plowed resources into regions and provinces where I was cheated in the snap elections\n\n\nThe politics of revenge has had its day\n\n\nThe organized  the organized participation of the people in daily government may provide the stabilizing element that government has always lacked\n\n Policies have radically changed with each administration yet the basic needs of its unchanging constituencies have not been met\n\n economic safety net for the common man\n\n The active participation of the people in government will lend proper direction and continuity to policy\n\n This is what I wish for most that after me the continuity of our work is not broken so that things well-done shall be completed and the same mistakes avoided", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

we shall focus our attention on\npreparing for the celebration of our first centennial of independence\n\n\nOur choice of the theme for this year 's commemoration is most\nfitting  Diwang Pilipino Isaisip Isapuso Isagawa  \n\n\nFor truly this is the time when we Filipinos in thought in heart and\nin action must relive the national spirit that made us free, \n\n\nLet us all  take encouragement  as we embark on this\nyear-long undertaking\n\n\nOur nation is secure our nation is stable and our nation is\ncompetitive, \n\n\nFor five long years we have given our best to the challenges before\nus in order this time for our hearts and minds our <unclear> 1 word\n\n</unclear> and energies have been collectively directed toward the singular\nobjective of raising our nation from the pits of crises and stagnation to the\nthreshold of sustained progress\n\n\nAnd we have not been denied\n\n\nOur country is at peace not only with other nations but within our\nown national community which once was fragmented by rebellion and insurgency\n\n\nOur democracy is stable with our Constitution fully reigning over\nour national life and our democratic institutions fully functioning, \n\n\nOur social reforms to guarantee the the delivery of our people 's\nbasic needs are being implemented and our economy is growing achieving a\nlevel of productivity unprecedented in our history\n\n\nIn all our recent labors and struggles one thing above all has\nstood out and that is the fact that working together and with democracy as\nour standard we Filipinos can move our nation forward, \n\n\nWe will not be where we are today but for the faith and spirit that\nsince June twelve eighteen ninety-eight has fortified us in trials and crises\nthat sometimes seem overwhelming\n\n\nThat faith and spirit first found its voice in Dr Jose Rizal who\ngave his life on these grounds for believing that Filipinos could be a nation\nin their own right\n\n\nThat faith or spirit was forged on the anvil of revolution by\nAndres Bonifacio whose centennial we mark this year and that faith and spirit\nproclaimed itself to the world in Kawit Cavite ninety-nine years ago when\nPresident Emilio Aguinaldo raised the flag of our republic\n\n\nAround these great events and personages at the turn of the\nnineteenth century the story of our people before and since has always turned\n\n\nOur independence proclamation in eighteen ninety-eight crowned our\npeople 's unceasing struggle since the time of Lapu-Lapu and Soliman to be\nfree and sovereign in our own land and it claimed for all Filipino\ngenerations since the challenge of building recovering defending and\nstrengthening the Filipino nation\n\n\nIn the web of history all our struggles aspirations and\nachievements as a people come together and they lay claim to our memories as\nwe prepare to mark our first centennial as a republic and approach a new\ncentury of challenge\n\n\nLet us therefore gather our energies together to ensure the\nsuccessful commemoration of our first centennial\n\n\nIt demands the collective participation of all our people every\ngroup every sector every community every creed every family and every citizen\nwho constitute our nation  \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nThank you Mr President\n\n\nMr President distinguished ladies and gentlemen of the Senate my\ncountrymen\n\n\nMr President uh almost eight years ago I stood before this august\nchamber armed with all the courage and fervor I could summon and boldly\nshouted \" no \" a thousand \" no \" to the\nextension of the United States military bases in the Philippines\n\n\nThe crucial issue at that time was whether to terminate the\npresence of American military basing facilities in the country or not\n\n\nToday Mr President once again we are confronted with yet another\nvital issue of similar import and that is whether or not the Senate should\ngive its concurrence to the Visiting Forces Agreement\n\n\nAnd this time Mr President I rise in this great and important forum\nof our people to proclaim before the entire nation \" yes \" a\nthousand \" yes \" to the Visiting Forces Agreement between\nour country and the United States of America\n\n\nMr President I realize the seeming contradiction between my\nposition now and my position then\n\n\nIn nineteen ninety-one out of personal conviction I completely\naligned myself with those who opposed the extension of American military\npresence in the country\n\n\nI was totally convinced and committed to vote against it as I\nfinally did\n\n\nAnd I gave you my assurance Mr President that if any attempt should\nbe made to revive the presence of foreign military bases in the country I\nwould be the first to firmly stand again amongst those who would oppose such\na venture with the same passion and conviction\n\n\nToday however I 've aligned myself with those who are supporting\nthe approval of the Visiting Forces Agreement which will in effect allow\nagain the entry of American troops in the country\n\n\nAnd like before I am as equally convinced and committed to vote in\nfavor of our concurrence as I do now\n\n\nBecause of this Mr President I deem it my duty to give a candid\nexplanation to our people who gave me the mandate the honor and the privilege\nto serve them in this chamber\n\n\nI owe it to them most especially and to history as well to  render a clear and faithful account of why I have taken such seemingly\ndiametrically opposing positions on so important and critical national issues\nof our time as the total removal of American forces from the Philippines on\nthe one hand and our concurrence to the on the Visiting Forces Agreement on\nthe other\n\n\nBut let me digress briefly at this juncture Mr President and relate\nto you the general impression I gathered during several hearings and\ndeliberations on the mis measure under consideration\n\n\nAlthough our proceedings were conducted under an atmosphere of\nguarded civility the discussions were in many instances marred by some degree\nof asperity and animosity\n\n\nThere were if you will still recall angry diatribes and outbursts\nin and out of the areas where we held our hearings\n\n\nEven our recent debates in this hall were not spared\n\n\nIn addition the arguments of those who appeared to offer their\nopposition and pardon me for saying this were boringly and tiresomely\nrepetitious and highly emotional and if I may add garnished with a generous\nproportion of bias and prejudice\n\n\nWhat struck me most as significant however Mr President was the\nsectoral composition and arguments of those who appear to oppose the Visiting\nForces Agreement\n\n\nThey were in many respects identical to the sectoral composition\nand arguments of those who previously stood against the extension of the\nUnited States military bases\n\n\nIn fact I got the impression that there was hardly anything new\nthat was added under the sun\n\n\nIt was to me no more than a  deja vu  of\nnineteen ninety-one the same banners the same streamers the same propaganda\ntactics the same stereotyped speeches the same anti-American slogans the same\nanti-imperialism <unclear> 1 word </unclear> the same invectives the same\nclenched fists were all too evident to be seen and heard\n\n\nAnd so since the similarity of the opposition in both cases was\nquite obvious Mr President I deemed it worthless to further dwell on that and\nso I will therefore simply confine my narration to the arguments presented by\nthe two sides of the debate in nineteen ninety-one to show how closely alike\nthey were to the arguments now being heard in connection with the Visiting\nForces Agreement\n\n\nYou will recall Mr President that the anti-American bases groups\nargued then that never again should foreign military bases troops or\nfacilities be allowed in our country\n\n\nThat our national sovereignty and self-respect required no less\nthan the total dismantling and removal of all vestiges of our colonial past\n\n\nThat the existence in our land of American military bases and their\ncomponent troops and facilities would unnecessarily involve us in\ninternational conflicts that were not of our own making or liking\n\n\nThat such military bases troops and facilities were really not\nmeant to promote our national security but were intended instead to advance\nthe defense strategy and economic power of the United States of America\n\n\nAnd that they would serve more as a potent magnet for offensive\nmilitary action that would endanger the safety of our country and possibly\nexpose our people to a very grave risk if not actual disaster and ruin\n\n\nAnd that instead of casting aside the historic opportunity\npresented to us at that time to be truly independent and self-reliant\nRepublic we should seize and use it to attain our complete freedom so that we\ncould shape our own future and chart our own foreign policy unencumbered by\nany demeaning burden on our dignity and honor as a nation\n\n\nYou will also recall Mr President on the other hand that the\nadvocates of continued American military presence in the in our country\nespecially in Clark and Subic insisted that American military bases troops\nand facilities were good for our country\n\n\nThat we really needed them for our defense and security\n\n\nThat their presence would enhance the prestige of our country and\nwould moreover preserve and provide jobs for our countrymen\n\n\nThat they would assure the rapid development and improvement of our\nmilitary capability\n\n\nThat they would effectively maintain the balance of power in the\nSoutheast Asian region\n\n\nAnd that they would serve as a strong and dependable deterrent\nagainst any predatory nation that might have any ill-conceived design to harm\nus\n\n\nYou will perhaps recall remember too Mr President that in nineteen\nninety-one I was the lone fiscalizer in the Senate against the administration\nof then President Corazon C Aquino and at the same time the Minority Floor\nLeader of this chamber\n\n\nAnd because of my unique role then as the only remaining elected\nopposition Senator of the Republic and because especially of my intimate\nknowledge and assessment of our national condition at that time I\nunconditionally and without any hesitation supported the total removal of all\nAmerican bases from the country\n\n\nI also fully concurred with the anti-American bases groups then\nthat those military bases established in nineteen forty-seven initially and\nprimarily to serve the United  interests and to project her\nmilitary power abroad\n\n\nThey were not at all intended for or involved in the security of\nthe Philippines\n\n\nIn fact the United States according to the common understanding at\nthat time had no obligation whatsoever under the Military Bases Agreement to\ndefend us against any foreign military invader except when her own military\nbases were themselves the object of attack\n\n\nIt was only later on that those military bases were somehow linked\nto our national security because of the Mutual Defense Treaty concluded in\nnineteen fifty-one which forged and established our defense alliance with the\nUnited States of America\n\n\nAnd those military bases were conveniently used by the United\nStates in fulfilling her obligation to us under the Mutual Defense Treaty\n\n\nIn legal  norm  therefore those military bases had nothing\nto do in creating the military alliance between the two countries\n\n\nToday Mr President in voting as I do now in favor of our\nconcurrence to the Visiting Forces Agreement I am more persuaded and impelled\nnow than I was in nineteen ninety-one by the same consideration of national\nsecurity for the country\n\n\nPerhaps because of my  because my political role has\nchanged from what it had been in nineteen ninety-one since I 'm now a member\nof the ruling coalition in this chamber there is reason to think that I will\nsimply follow the dictates of the ruling majority and vote in favor of our\nconcurrence for no other consideration and reason than pure political\nexpediency\n\n\nMr President that I will never do\n\n\nIf I were to simply vote in favor of this important measure on the\nbasis of a mere of mere political alignment that to me would be tantamount to\na betrayal of my sworn obligation as an elected Senator of the Republic\n\n\nHaving been one of the so-called \" Magnificent Twelve\n\n\" that voted in nineteen ninety-one for the removal of American\nmilitary bases I cannot and will not just disregard or sweep aside the\ncollective best interests of this nation\n\n\nNeither will I allow myself Mr President to be swayed by the almost\nirresistible appeal of esteemed friends and professional colleagues nor to be\nintimidated frightened or pressured by the strident clamor the blandishment\nand arrogant threats of noisy boisterous groups that stand opposed to the\nVisiting Forces Agreement no matter how popular their position or how serious\ntheir threats may be without carefully scrutinizing the material and relevant\nnational interest involved\n\n\nOf course Mr President as a human being if I were principally moved\nby a purely selfish motive if I were only concerned with my own political\ninterest or personal well-being that would have been the most  facile  \nthe most logical the most rewarding and the safest course of action for me to\nhave taken\n\n\nBut then again had I done that had I acted otherwise than to\ndetermine carefully for myself the most sensible and advantageous course of\naction the country should follow in the wake of her present circumstance it\nwould have been a faithless discharge of my duty as a Senator", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "24d27dfc-88a6-4478-89c9-8ffef3d570d2", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.281927+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nMr President there are perhaps as many ways to look at the V F\nA as there are observers and critics and there are equally numerous issues\nthat can be  brought  and discussed in order to form an opinion either\nfavoring or rejecting this Agreement\n\n\nThere will be no end to the debates but by the end of the day we\nneed to make a choice\n\n\nAnd as is true on any other issue we need to decide no matter how\ndifficult the choices may be and act in accordance with our conscience and\nwhat we believe is to our national interest\n\n\nMr President no one I repeat no one has a monopoly of patriotism\n\n\nI cast my vote in favor of the Visiting Forces Agreement\nratification in the Senate\n\n\nI do so with much confidence and optimism that the greatest\ninterests of the Filipino people shall have been served when this treaty\nfinally comes into force\n\n\nMy vote favoring the ratification of the V F A is anchored on two\nfundamental concerns one the need to strengthen our defense capability and\ntwo the legal and constitutional issues which if adequately understood by\neveryone would expose and erase the false fears peddled about by the  about the V F A by its opponents\n\n\nMr President to begin with the V F A merely operationalizes previous\nagreements forged between the Philippines and the United States under the\nMutual Defense Treaty\n\n\nUnder Article two of the Mutual Defense Treaty both parties had\nagreed to separately and jointly by self-help and mutual aid maintain and\ndevelop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack\n\n\nBut these being short on the  on the details of how to\ngo about developing such capacity to resist armed attack Article three of the\nsame treaty broadly mandates the foreign ministers of both parties or their\ndeputies to consult from time to time regarding the treaty 's implementation\n\n\nMr President there is a diversity of possibilities that are heavily\nhinged on the V F A 's ratification or rejection not the least of which is\nthe promotion and preservation of the country 's economic security\n\n\nThis stems from the fact that the bulk of the  \ntrade and economic ties with other countries is carried out in the vast\nexpanse of the South China Sea\n\n\nFor instance Mr President data reveal that about forty percent of\nour exports which are shipped to the different parts of Asia is almost wholly\ntransported through the South China Sea and surrounding seas\n\n\nAnother twenty-five percent of our exports to Europe is likewise\nshipped through routes along or traversing this sea\n\n\nOn top of that more than ninety percent of our oil supply from\nmajor trading partners is also transported through the South China Sea\n\n\nTrade in this region and beyond may even be expected to expand on\naccount of globalization and the increasing economic interdependence of\nnations\n\n\nYet the threats to regional security and stability remain Mr\nPresident\n\n\nThe still-unsettled question of sovereignty overs over the Spratlys\nfor instance is continually seen as a potential flashpoint of conflict\n\n\nIt has to be emphasized that despite the growing importance of the\nSouth China Sea to us there appears to be no way or no means for us to\nactually defend or enforce our interest therein\n\n\nNo less than our own Defense Department has admitted the painful if\nnot so surprising fact that our country is militarily weak and extremely\nvulnerable to the external threats and that it neither has the mean it\nneither has to the means nor, it neither has the means nor the influence\nto deter those who would take our patrimony and cut away our sovereignty in\nfront of our very eyes\n\n\nMr President it will not be often that an opportunity to strengthen\nour capability to enforce our common interest with the United States will\npresent itself\n\n\nThe V F A is one such opportunity we cannot afford to miss\n\n\nFor without the Visiting Forces Agreement any thought of arming\nourselves in defense of our interests or to deter aggression will be\nmeaningless\n\n\nOn the other hand through the Visiting Forces Agreement we shall\nhave the practical means to one improve the capability of our armed forces\ntwo strengthen our national defense strategy three  strengthen\nregional stability and our relations with the United States in all important\ndimensions security trade foreign policy environmental protection and\nresource preservation\n\n\nHaving thus said, let me just enter into the records my position\non the various contin contentious issues raised by those opposing the\nVisiting Forces Agreement particularly the constitutional and legal points\n\n\nMy vote in favor of the Visiting Forces Agreement carries with it\nthe submission that there are no constitutional or legal infirmities\n\n\nOne the V F A need not go through the ratification process under\nArticle eighteen Section twenty-five of the Constitution\n\n\nAn examination of the records of the Constitutional Commission\nreveals that temporary placement of troops in Philippine territory as that\ncontemplated under the V F A need not go through the special procedural\nrequirement under Article eighteen Section twenty-five\n\n\nClearly Mr President the intent of the framers of our Constitution\nis that the placement or stationing of such foreign forces and installation\nin the country must be made with some degree of permanency\n\n\nAnd let me quote the records of the Constitutional Convention\nvolume four page seven hundred eighty-two to seven hundred eighty-three  \nlong quotation  \n\n\nMr President this view is in fact supported by the opinion number\nthirty-four series of nineteen ninety-seven of the Department of Justice\n\n\nThe opinion reads in part quote  This Department has\nconsistently ruled that the aforementioned uh aforequoted  \nConstitutional provision disallows the establishment of foreign military\nbases and the facilities for stationing of foreign troops similar to the U S\nmilitary presence in the Philippines under the R P - U S Military Bases\nAgreement of nineteen forty-seven as amended and that it prohibits the\npresence of alien military units in the country which is characterized by\nsome degree of permanency and magnitude unless the conditions set forth in\nthe Constitution are met   additional quoted sentences  \n\n\nSince the Visiting Forces Agreement pertains to and provides only\nfor brief and temporary visits of U S troops in the Philippines the Agreement\nmay be thus ratified on the basis of Article seven Section twenty-one of the\nConstitution which sets  no treaty or international agreement shall be\nvalid and effective unless concurred in by at least two-thirds of all the\nmembers of the Senate  under Article six Section twenty-one\n\n\nSecond Mr President even if it be conceived that the V F A is\nwithin the ambit of Article eighteen Section twenty-five the Agreement would\nstill be constitutional and a binding agreement\n\n\nThe premise of those who argue for the submission under Article\neighteen is that the V F A would be unconstitutional in the absence of advice\nand consent by the U S Senate which they believe is not forthcoming in view\nof the United States government 's pronouncement to that effect\n\n\nThus there being no such ratification by the U S Senate it is\nargued by the critics that the V F A cannot be considered as to have been\nduly recognized by the United States government\n\n\nMr President the argument carries with it the implication that our\nconstitutional requirements be complied with by a sovereign equal\n\n\nThis cannot be so Mr President\n\n\nAs articulated by two distwinguis distinguished members of the\nConstitutional Commission ratification may be effected in accordance with the\nlaws of such other contracting state\n\n\nAllow me to quote therefore the exchange between Commissioners\nMaombong and Bernas found in volume four of the records of the Constitutional\nCommission page seven hundred eighty-two  quoted exchange  \n\n\nClearly then Mr President the recognition by the other contracting\nstate shall be in accordance with its own constitutional or municipal laws\n\n\nThis is necessarily so since under international law a state cannot\nimpose its own municipal requirements on another state\n\n\nThree on criminal jurisdiction I submit that the Visiting Forces\nAgreement provisions governing criminal jurisdiction add nothing more to what\nthe Philippines already adheres to under generally accepted principles of\ninternational law which by explicit constitutional affirmation is made part\nof the law of the land\n\n\nThe V F A provisions on criminal jurisdiction derogate Philippine\nsovereignty no more than the country 's adherence to a host of other treaties\nand to the generally accepted principles of international law particularly on\nthe aspect of sovereign immunity\n\n\nLet me quote an authority on this point  long quotation from a\nforeign author  \n\n\nMr President the grant of sovereign immunity is made more explicit\nin the case of foreign troops\n\n\nIt has been ruled by our Supreme Court in the case of Beyer versus\nTison G R number L dash two four two nine four May three nineteen seventy\nfour  long quotation  \n\n\nMr President nonetheless our Supreme Court was quick to add that\nsuch principle shall yield to treaty stipulations\n\n\nThe V F A therefore Mr President shall limit the applicability and\nextent of the doctrine by allowing exercise of jurisdiction by the\nPhilippines on certain offenses or class of offenses\n\n\nConcededly there are certain types of offenses which the\nPhilippines by its own accord has agreed to a restriction to its sovereign\nright of jurisdiction under the doctrine of <unclear> 1 or 2 words </unclear> \nlimitation\n\n\nThus the V F A may have diminished Philippine jurisdiction in some\naspects\n\n\nHowever it cannot be said that the jurisdiction of the Philippines\nhas altogether disappeared as it is made to appear\n\n\nThe only class of offenses which the Philippines under the V F A\nhas no jurisdiction are those relating to the security of the United States\nand those punishable solely under the laws of the United States\n\n\nIn all other offenses the Philippines has either exclusive primary\nor concurrent jurisdiction\n\n\nThe fact that the Philippines has jurisdiction in all offenses\npunishable under its laws negates the claim that the V F A grants immunity to\nU S personnel or accords them special or preferential treatment\n\n\nFour it is a distortion to claim that the R P - U S V F A has\nprovisions inferior to those appearing in similar agreements of the United\nStates with other countries\n\n\nLet me just cite the provision on waiver of jurisdiction as an\nexample\n\n\nThe U S agreements with Japan South Korea Australia and NATO\nuniformly provide that quote  The authorities of the state having the\nprimary right shall give sympathetic consideration to a request from the\nauthorities of the other state for a waiver of its right in cases where the\nwhere that other state considers such a waiver to be of particular importance\n\n close quote\n\n\nIn diplomatic parlance Mr President this sympathetic consideration\nclause calls for automatic waiver\n\n\nThe R P negotiators thus resisted this language\n\n\nBoth parties settled instead on the following  Philippine\nauthorities will waive their primary right to exercise jurisdiction in  except in cases of particular importance to the Philippines  end\nof quote\n\n\nWe will note Mr President that the broad formulation of the\nexception clause practically nullifies the mandatory meaning if any was\nintended that can be given to the use of the words \" will waive\n\n\" \n\n\nThe U S er Israeli agreement states quote  Israel will waive\nits primary right to exercise over  members of the force except in\ncases where the authorities of Israel after special consideration determine\nthat its interests acquire require the exercise of Israeli jurisdiction\n\n end of quote and with Spain quote  Spanish authorities except\nin cases of particular importance to them will exercise their right to waive\ntheir primary  jurisdiction upon the request of U S authorities\n\n end of quote\n\n\nThe language of the R P - U S V F A provision Mr President on\nwaiver of jurisdiction is for all purposes the same as that of Spain and\nsimilar to that of Israel in providing for a broad exceptional clause to the\nwaiver of jurisdiction\n\n\nAnd these are better than the automatic waiver clause contained in\nthe agreements with Japan South Korea Australia and NATO\n\n\nThe U S agreements with Egypt Honduras and the Netherlands also\ncontain the phrase \" will waive except in cases of particular\nimportance or exceptional importance \" \n\n\nFive it is argued that the V F A provisions on criminal\njurisdiction is in usurpation usurpation of the judicial power to promulgate\nrules of court procedure particularly in allowing the United States military\ncommander to have custody of the offending U S personnel pending\ninvestigation or trial before Philippine authorities\n\n\nMr President the V F A does not provide for a different procedure\nfor the custody and prosecution of U S military personnel before the\nPhilippine courts\n\n\nIt does not Mr President in any manner modify the existing rules of\ncriminal procedure nor does it provide for a new procedure governing such\nsubjects\n\n\nIt is in fact consistent with and cognizant of the rules\npromulgated by the Supreme Court\n\n\nSix the release of accused pending trial is not purely a judicial\nmatter\n\n\nThis issue has been raised in relation to the provision allowing\ncustody by U S military commanders\n\n\nMr President the custody and detention of accused pending trial is\na matter not within the exclusive domain of the judiciary particularly the\nSupreme Court\n\n\nThe Constitution and the rules of court provide quote  All\npersons except those charged with offenses punishable by  reclusion\nperpetua  with evidence of <unclear> 2 words </unclear> shall\nbefore conviction be bailable by sufficient sureties or be released on\nrecognizance as may be provided by law  that is under Article three\nSection thirteen\n\n\nWhenever allowed pursuant to law the rules of court provide or\nthese rules the court may release a person in the custody in custody on his\nown recognizance or that of a responsible person\n\n\nClearly therefore Mr President the release of the accused on\nrecognizance is made pursuant to law and not under the rules of court alone\n\n\nIt is submitted that the V F A provision allowing custody of U S\nmilitary personnel accused in our jurisdiction to U S military authorities is\nconstitutionally and legally allowed\n\n\nThere can be no doubt that U S military authorities can qualify as\nthe responsible person under whom the custody of the accused may be reposed.\n\n 1", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nWith the permission of uh the President I would like to uh\nexplain my vote\n\n\n Mr President last Monday I delivered the invocation on behalf of\nthe Senate and in that I asked the Good Lord through his son Jesus Christ to\nprovide us the way  mga daan at paraan para tayo ay makapaghusga ng V F\nA sa tama at sa ikaliligaya ng ating bayang Pilipinas   \n\n\nMr President I begin by asking why not\n\n\nToday the Senate of the eleventh Congress is being called upon to\nconcur or not to concur in the ratification of the Visiting Forces Agreement\nV F A between the United States and the Republic of the Philippines\n\n\nTo be sure friends and foes of the V F A from the clergy to the\nordinary citizen have given me counsel and advice\n\n\nI received letters telegrams and telephone calls from so many\n\n\nI wish to place on record Mr President that I appreciate all these\nadvice and views solicited and otherwise given as they were to assist me in\nevaluating the pros and cons of the V F A\n\n\nI cannot thank them enough for their concern but at the end of the\nday Mr President the ball remains with me so to speak because the occasion\ncalls for each of the Senator to make a personal judgment\n\n\nConsequently for those whose views and opinions I cannot accommodate\nfor the reasons I would later on explain I wish to thank them again for\nenriching my perspectives\n\n\nI only hope that they will treat this matter as a case of clashing\nopposing opinions and not a repudiation of their position\n\n\n Walang personalan trabaho po lang ito  \n\n\nMr President the solemn occasion today is not only to decide the\nfate of the V F A but to do honor to the Filipino people who put me here\n\n\nLet me assure therefore one and all that my decision is based on\nwhat I personally believe in and what is best for the country and the\nFilipinos\n\n\nThe sponsors of the V F A have valiantly defended the provisions of\nthe V F A against the legal political and moral assaults by those who in good\nfaith oppose and or express reservation to the V F A\n\n\nThey have replied with utmost sincerity and forthrightness to the\nmany questions that have been raised\n\n\nThey have rebutted with logic sometimes evasive and convoluted but\nmost of the time rational and candid every argument raised against the V F A\n\n\nFor sure there are various important concerns which my colleagues\nhave articulated and raised sometimes with utmost passion and with great\npersonal convictions\n\n\nConcerns such as whether the V F A is a treaty or an international\nagreement or a mere executive agreement whether the applicable constitutional\nprovision is Section twenty-five Article eighteen or Section twenty-one\nArticle seven whether the V F A would violate the nuclear-free provision of\nSection eight Article two of the Constitution whether Americans will\nautomatically come to the aid of the Philippines if any of our claimed\nterritory is subjected to armed attack by foreign forces whether more\nsecurity and military assistance would be forthcoming whether more economic\nsupport and more U S investment would come to the Philippines and finally\nwhether the Philippines has surrendered once again its criminal jurisdiction\nover offenses committed in the Philippines by U S military personnels\n\n\nMr President I share all these concerns but some of these concerns\ncannot be resolved in this chamber with finality as they involve legal and\nconstitutional issues\n\n\nIn due time I 'm sure Mr President the Supreme Court will be called\nupon to rule on the validity of these legal propositions\n\n\nAfter all as U S Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes observed and I\nquote  we are under a Constitution but the Constitution is what the\njudges say it is  unquote\n\n\nUntil the Supreme Court shall have ruled otherwise Mr President I\nsubscribe to the legal proposition that the V F A is an international\nagreement and that the applicable provision of the Constitution is Section\ntwenty-one Article eight Article seven\n\n\nThis view is not without legal basis since the other uh provision\nSection twenty-five Article eighteen obviously referred to the then-existing\nnineteen forty-seven Military Bases Agreement between the United States and\nthe Philippines a state of fact that was not lost in the minds of the\nCommissioners that drafted the nineteen eighty-seven Constitution\n\n\nThus I read Section twenty-five Article eighteen as providing a\nconstitutional guideline on the process of how the nineteen forty-seven\nMilitary Bases Agreement were to be renewed\n\n\nAs it turned out Mr President this chamber terminated the M B A and\ncorrectly so if I may add\n\n\nSee debates record of the Constitutional Commission page six\nhundred sixty-three\n\n\nI also believe that the V F A does not authorize any U S bases\nfacility or troops to be permanently maintained in the Philippines\n\n\nNo legal gobbledygook or language engineering would justify such an\ninterpretation of the provisions of the V F A\n\n\nI further believe Mr President that the one-year deadline to\nterminate judicial proceedings against American personnel is more a challenge\nto improve our delivery of justice system in this country than a legal burden\nimposed by the V F A\n\n\nWith respect to other concerns which are basically political social\nand economic in character whether for instance America will provide more\nmilitary assistance whether more economic support and investment would come\nfrom America  etcetera  I firmly believe that this is a\nquestion of faith and trust faith that America will indeed deliver what it\npromises and trust that our national leaders will see to it that these\npromises are fulfilled\n\n\nMr President for me the most important aspect of the V F A is the\nquestion on jurisdiction over offenses committed by U S personnel against\nFilipinos in our land\n\n\nThe question has both legal and moral dimensions given our past\nexperience when the Military Bases Agreement was still extant\n\n\nIt is on this issue that my position has been focused and which\nwould determine my vote\n\n\nThe V F A for sure contains both exclusive and concurrent\njurisdiction over offenses committed by U S military personnel in the\nPhilippines\n\n\nWith respect to exclusive jurisdiction the language is too clear\nand categorical to merit further comments\n\n\nSuffice it to say Mr President that exclusive jurisdiction over\ncertain crimes committed by U S personnel goes in a way in favor of the\nPhilippines in certain cases and in favor of the U S in others\n\n\nHere Mr President the scale of justice to my view is evenly\nbalanced\n\n\nAdditionally off-duty offenses regardless of the gravity that are\ncommitted by U S military personnel on liberty or on pass are without any\ndoubt exclusively belong to Philippine jurisdiction\n\n\nHere happily both the U S and the Philippines agree paragraph three\nsubparagraph one point two joint report number forty-three of the Committee\non Foreign Relations and Committee on National Defense and Security page nine\n\n\nIt is however in the category of concurrent and primary\njurisdiction that I have great reservations Mr President\n\n\nThere are two vital points that concerns me\n\n\nFirst is the exception to the primary jurisdiction of the\nPhilippines under three B two  even though the Philippines has primary\njurisdiction the same may be lost if the offenses arise out of any act or\nomission done in the performance of official duty  \n\n\nOnce the military commander issue a duty certificate the same has\nthe effect of automatically divesting Philippine jurisdiction over the\noffenses committed by U S personnel in violation of Philippine laws\n\n\nThis obnoxious provision is found in the defunct Military Bases\nAgreement and was the source of intense irritants between the Philippines and\nthe U S governments\n\n\nI hope to God that the Philippine government has learned from the\npast and would now see to it that this provision is not abused by the U S\nMilitary Commanders\n\n\nOne way Mr President of preventing such abuse is to define the\nmeaning of \" official duty \" which incidentally is not\ndefined in the V F A\n\n\nThis representation Mr President will recall offered and the\nsponsors accepted the following definition of \" official duty\n\n\" and I quote  the term \" official duty \" is\nunderstood to be any duty or service required or authorized to be done by\nstatute regulation the order of a superior or military usage\n\n\n\" Official duty \" is not meant  and I\nwould like to emphasize  is not meant to include all acts by an\nindividual during the period during which he is on duty but is meant to apply\nonly to acts which are required or authorized to be done as a function of\nthat duty which the individual is performing  \n\n\nThus in the joint report happily the sponsor correctly stated that\ncrimes such as rape murder and similar heinous crimes cannot and should not\nbe included as having been performed in official duty\n\n\nThis definition was formally accepted as an amendment to resolution\nfour four three to wit  whereas in order to ensure that not all\noffenses by U S personnel arising out of any act or omission done in the\nperformance of official duty will not automatically be covered by a duty\ncertificate to be issued by the U S Military Commanders under paragraph E\nArticle five the term \" official duty \" as used in this\nparagraph is hereby defined as follows  again the definition  \nthe term \" official duty \" is understood to be any duty or\nservice required or authorized to be done by statute regulation the order of\na superior or military usage\n\n\n\" Official duty \" is not meant to include all acts\nby an individual during the period while he is on duty but is meant to apply\nonly to acts which are required or authorized to be done as a function of\nthat duty which the individual is performing  unquote\n\n\nFrom this definition Mr President which as embodied in resolution\nfour four three the validity or efficacy of the duty certificate to be issued\nby the U S Military Commanders will be measured and if found wanting by the\nPhilippine authorities should be rejected without hesitation and equivocation\n\n\nGiven the dark history of the duty certificate like the hated\n\n cedula  under Spain the new circumstances upon which the\nV F A will be operable that is absence of permanent U S military bases\nfacilities and troops in the Philippines the new breed of national regional\nand local <unclear> 1 word </unclear> leaders and finally the assertiveness\nand vigilance of the N G Os and the students and the other sectors I have no\ndoubt that the past would never be resurrected nor replicated in the use of\nduty certificate by U S Military Commanders\n\n\nI certainly would not allow it Mr President\n\n\nIt behooves therefore the concerned Philippine authorities not to\ntake the words of the U S Military Commanders at face value\n\n\nThey should be vigilant and strict to the point of being  \nmakulit   and  matigas   in asserting resolution four four three as well\nas the definition of \" official duty \" and evaluating the\ncircumstances and facts that have given rise to the issuance of the duty\ncertificate\n\n\nIn case of doubt Mr President the duty certificate once issued\nshould be reviewed and if found against the definition of official duty\nshould be rejected\n\n\nHappily the sponsors agreed to this approach\n\n\nSecond is the language used\n\n\nWhy is the V F A couched in a language distinctly different from\nother similar instruments with respect to concurrent and primary jurisdiction\n\n\nMore specifically I refer to the question of what appears to be an\nautomatic waiver of Philippine jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph three D\nArticle five which states and I quote  recognizing the responsibility\nof the United States military authorities to maintain good order and\ndiscipline among their forces Philippine authorities will upon request by the\nUnited States waive their primary right to exercise jurisdiction except in\ncases of particular importance to the Philippines\n\n\n If the government of the Philippines determines that the case\nis of particular importance it shall communicate such determination to the\nUnited States authorities within twenty days after the Philippine authorities\nreceived the  united  request   \n\n\nYet on identical situation Mr President America agreed to a much\ndifferent nay apparently more liberal language with respect to her Agreements\nwith other countries\n\n\nFor instance the Agreement with Japan on the same situation states\nand I quote  if the state having the primary right decides not to\nexercise jurisdiction it shall notify the authorities of the other state as\nsoon as practicable\n\n\n The authorities of the state having the primary right shall\ngive sympathetic consideration to a request from the authorities of the other\nstate for a waiver of its right in cases where that order other state\nconsiders such a waiver to be of particular importance   Article\nseventeen paragraph thirty-six of the Agreement between Japan and the United\nStates\n\n\nSimilarly Mr President the Agreement with South  South\nKorea Australia and the NATO countries to mention just a few contain the same\nlanguage as Japan\n\n\nInstead of \" automatic waiver \" the \" \nsympathetic consideration \" are the passwords in these countries\nwith respect to waiver of primary jurisdiction\n\n\nMr President the phrase \" sympathetic consideration\n\n\" does not convey to me as the same as \" automatic waiver\n\n\" found in the V F A\n\n\nYet during the several public hearings we were told that the\nparticular V F A language is no different in import than those found in\nAgreements with Japan South Korea Australia and the NATO countries because\nthe V F A provides an escape clause for the Philippines where it can always\ndeny the request of waiver of jurisdiction over cases which are of particular\nimportance to the Philippines\n\n\nIf indeed the import of the language quote \" sympathetic\nconsideration \" unquote is similar to quote \" automatic\nwaiver \" unquote why did our negotiator not insist on the former\n\n\nIn fact in the defunct Military Bases Agreement \" \nsympathetic consideration \" was the language used in the Agreement\nparagraph three C Article thirteen\n\n\nAre our negotiator less tenacious than their counterpart from the\nother countries\n\n\nOr do they really believe that despite the difference in the\nnomenclature the meaning is the same\n\n\nIf the language in Section three D Mr President is left by itself\nwithout any amendment of the V F A or subsequent clarificatory and binding\nundertaken undertaking from the concerned Philippine authorities from the\nexecutive department then it is obvious that there is indeed a difference and\nthat such difference places the Philippines in unequal footing with America\n\n\nThat situation is  nakakahiya   \nand definitely unacceptable to me Mr President\n\n\nI cannot overemphasize my personal concern on the subject of fair\nand equal administration of justice because I see a great number of Filipinos\nbeing deprived of elementary due process and justice\n\n\nIt is bad enough Mr President that at the hands of a fellow  \nPinoy  another  Pinoy  becomes a victim of injustice\nIt is worst and unforgivable if a  Pinoy  will suffer\ninjustice at the hands of a foreigner in cases involving crimes committed in\nthe

{"text": "<$A> \n\nUh Mr President uh honorable colleagues today the Senate is\nblessed with this historical moment faced again with responsibility and\nopportunity to be able to choose in these times of widespread discord and\nnational prerogative that has a concrete bearing on how we can preserve our\nsovereignty and the security of every Filipino\n\n\nReflected in this document are workable solutions providing for the\nvery existence of our Republic in a world besotted with conflict rage and\ninsecurities\n\n\nThis document will not only be the source of foreign policy\ndirection the Republic or this administration has to take but it will without\ndoubt confer us the necessary framework to prevail over waves of changes that\nwill engulf the unwitting and the ill-prepared\n\n\nThis document has been the source of bitter exchanges personal\nattacks and harsh pronouncements within this hallowed chamber and even out in\nthe street the other parliament\n\n\nEvery channel has been opened so that clashing viewpoints would be\nheard not only in the exercise of the inherent and constitutionally\nguaranteed right to freedom of expression\n\n\nThe  state  maintains open channels because it seeks the\nwisdom from what is spoken not just from the bombast\n\n\nWe all let it loose so each one every senator casting a vote the\ncitizen ventilating concerns can find the appropriate care and define the\nbalance of national interest and foreign policy initiatives on what could be\nthe end of the post cold war years\n\n\nIn a republican state international agreements are appropriately\nsubjected to intense debate because these cannot and should not be crafted on\nthe basis of the whims of the executive\n\n\nThe R P Visiting Forces Agreement is not just simply about military\nexercises nor of nuclear weapons nor of ugly Americans or of prostitutes\nneither merely of ravaged environments and menace of drugs and disease it is\nall this and more\n\n\nThe resulting interplay of economic politico-military and\nsocio-cultural forces in a new global dynamic shall determine how the V F A\nand those who shall father it are branded or remembered irrelevant or\nrelevant subservient or nationalist\n\n\nThe debates have all prepared us for this task and warned us enough\nhow to bear the consanses consequences of our vote <unclear> words </unclear> \nand immediately and far-off into the future\n\n\nAlthough they had the chance in nineteen eighty-six the framers of\nour Constitution did not reject American presence outright\n\n\nThe framers of our Constitution sought a balance of patriotism and\npragmatism consciously\n\n\nThey so worded foreign policy and the transitory provisions to the\nnineteen eighty-seven Constitution to allow us to savor the challenge of this\nhistoric vote\n\n\nThey did not find wisdom in taking away the options of the\nexecutive towards enhancing national security and assuring peace with our\nshores within our shores\n\n\nThe Senate on the other hand also found enough reason to wait out\nto wait it out for four years in nineteen ninety-one\n\n\nThe Senate did not extend the  stay they plainly let\nthe R P - U S sem um M B A lapse\n\n\nWhen the last ships of Americans and their dependents left eight\nyears ago the people in the Senate these same hallowed ch chambers left one\nof the foundations of future Filipino-American relations the Mutual Defense\nTreaty intact unchanged unchallenged\n\n\nBut today more than ever we know and feel it in our guts that we\nneed a new framework to put more meaning and muscle to commitments under the\nR P - U S Mutual Defense Treaty a treaty that we did not abrogate a treaty\nwhich the people rejoiced the ejection of the American bases did not press to\nabrogate even with three changing of the guards in Congress\n\n\nI believe the decision made today should be based on the most\nimportant factor national security defined correctly and in the long term\n\n\nExternal defense and the protection of territorial boundaries not\nonly not only external defense and protection of the territorial boundaries\nbut also increasingly of economic security in a world directed towards\nglobalization where peace assures us and our neighbors equitable use of\nresources in the region\n\n\nAs human contact across oceans reach new levels and frequencies\njust recently unimaginable we now realize that we are interconnected not only\nin the physical sense but in the plane of changing international morality\nplayed out in interregional and global engagements\n\n\nForeign relation initiatives must reflect the correct appraisal of\nthe values of alliances\n\n\nIt is easy to claim that one is against war and easier still to\ninvoke the Constitution which renounces war as an instrument of national\npolicy\n\n\nHowever I believe no responsible leader can play blind to real and\npotential threats to peace equality justice freedom cooperation and amity\nwith all nations\n\n\nIt is not enough to denounce aggressors and it is fatal to be an\nisland by itself\n\n\nWe should not be trapped in the web of insecurities ab attributed\nto being neutral\n\n\nNeither should we  couch  as to throw ourselves into the\ncamp of the bigger bully as if wishing that another holocaust will break up\n\n\nWe have to wield foreign relations instrument to reap the benefits\nof a security continuum which allow us to struggle  \narrangements and employ initiatives ranging from one that is entirely neutral\nto that of dependence to a superior power depending on the need of the times\n\n\nWe have to take a calculated pace in this security continuum\n\n\nBasic to finding the reasons to confront options in this security\ncontinuum is having the courage to face new and emerging configurations of\nthe new global dynamic\n\n\nAnd after a continuing assessment of the new global dynamic to\nslowly but surely enter multilateral and bilateral arrangements geared\ntowards self-reliance\n\n\nI understand why others find comfort in old patterns characterized\nmainly by unequal ties betwan between the Philippines and the United States\nand as breaking away much later\n\n\nThere too was comfort in the belief that the U S what that this\nthreshold of declining influence in the initial embarrassments and the very\nvivid images of its pull-out from Vietnam handling of this whole hostage\nsituation in Iran and its being booted out from the Philippines\n\n\nThe image of the U S on the brink of collapse was reassuring the\nfavorite line was that the U S enjoying a peak would soon in a rage bring\ndown itself and its allies in a war of its own undoing\n\n\nLikewise the U S S R 's grip of its satellite was slowly slipping\nafter it went into a wave of changes. The rising nationalism of U S S R 's\ncomponent republics led to the formal internment in nineteen ninety-two of an\nailing Soviet empire\n\n\nThe end of the post cold war was carved deeply into men 's minds\nwhen the one raging symbol of the cold war the Berlin Wall was pick-axed and\nbulldozed in eight in nineteen eighty-nine\n\n\nThe mad men 's game of the arms race was gone the cold war was over\n\n\nAnd Mr President we pretended being secure within our shores\n\n\nWe lulled in the feeling we that had an even chance of having peace\nafter breaking the suffocating yoke of a former colonizer and its only rival\nsplinter\n\n\nA period of disengagements the integration reassertion of political\nand cultural independence erasing old spheres of influence of the great\npowers characterized what we commonly term the post cold war world\n\n\nThis was a unique period in modern history\n\n\nNo big war was dividing the world\n\n\nThe various causes were fought by swift troop attacks including\ngovernment-funded mercenaries and terrorists\n\n\nThat stretch of time so the great powers waging battles that were\nstill about controlling continents without the use of the giant talents of\narmies which constituted the panorama of the two world wars\n\n\nThis period showed the enlargement of the the demec democratic\nworld in the U S efforts in Panama the break-up of the Soviet Empire and\nChina 's political reforms\n\n\nThe two Germanys reunited while other  European\nrepublics splintered into smaller nations\n\n\nThe Soviets rev uh withdrew from Cuba Middle East conflicts\nsimmered to the accord between Israel and Palestinian Liberation Organization\nand in the meantime Mr President that democratic space expanded in Turkey and\nother Eurasian states\n\n\nThe manifestations that this period will not hold and was only\ntemporary was present but we failed to read through the fine print muddled as\nwe are and merely stared at the unfolding of the tapestry of global events\n\n\nThe post cold war world was headed to a conclusion\n\n\nKosovo may just have done it\n\n\nI subscribe to the analysis that we are coasting through to the\nconclusion of an  interregnum  a gap between two tempests\nthe crumbling of the Berlin Wall and Madeleine 's war\n\n\nA lot of us gathered here missed the  interregnum\n\n \n\n\nUnbeknownst to us we also just managed to exist in a superficial\npeace without exerting any efforts to craft a comprehensive foreign policy\nrelevant to the security of the  future\n\n\nThe importance of the crumbling of the Berlin Wall in geopolitics\nwas lost on us as the Aquino administration used it only to shame local\ninsurgents\n\n\nIf not for the large army of Filipino workers the government would\nhave also looked the other way when Iraq 's ins expansionist wars in the\nnineties had to be stopped by United Nations-sanctioned Desert Shield and its\nbombardment in Desert Storm\n\n\nThese two events should have signaled the Aquino cabinet to\nimmediately craft and strategize on an independent foreign policy\n\n\nThen we would have had the opportunity to that  nullify the old valid charge of the great nationalist Claro M Recto that\nthe Philippines has a mendicant foreign policy\n\n\nThis also explains why we are lost with the impact of the\nrealignments in the post cold war world\n\n\nThe government missed the signals that was alerting us to the\npossibility that the superficial peace being savored will be broken\n\n\nThe wars in far-off shores are impacting on us while swelling wars\ninside our   yards are threatening whatever\nwas holding peace\n\n\nUntil nineteen ninety-eight the United States the only remaining\nsuper power had worried about Serbia Iraq and North Korea\n\n\nCurrently it is forced to reckon with the strength of Russia France\nJapan and China\n\n\nRussia is now in the process of  reunification with the\nfragment of its old Soviet empire\n\n\nIn nineteen ninety-eight Russia found a center of gravity in\nanti-Americanism sparked by the unannounced U S bombing of Iraq driving a\nwedge into the Russian psyche that power to spoil U S actions had slipped\naway\n\n\nPowerlessness was the  collective shame because\nthe returns were never realized\n\n\nThe in-flow of American investments and loans had drastically\nconstricted therefore it sought a reattachment with China a renewed alliance\nwith China will counter aggressive U S pressures to acquire increasingly\nRussian economic cooperation\n\n\nThe U S now has to consider France after its effort exhibited in\nIraq\n\n\nIt may be the U S forces that are leading NATO forces but it does\nnot monopolize the directions and the ultimate conclusion of the Serbian\ndrama\n\n\nJapan poses another challenge to the U S despite clearly securing\nits sovereign through American military presence its independent assessment\nof the North Korean threat already felt in Pentagon\n\n\nMeanwhile China let cannot let its economy weaken or be\nartificially propped up\n\n\nIt wants to emerge to be a stabilizing factor\n\n\nThe most conservative of U S policy makers appreciating the global\naspiration for peace reflect this in their recommendations as follows\nsafeguard U S national security through a non-proliferation policy on nuclear\nweapons prevent a major power threat to Europe East Asia or the Persian Gulf\nthrough a U S permanent power position in the Pacific maintain access to\nforeign trade through NAFTA and actively seek open markets to benefit\nAmerican consumers and exporters protect Americans against threats to their\nlives and well-being by decisive action against terrorists and international\ncrime syndicates maintain access to resources the most strategic of which is\nforeign oil which supplies half of American needs\n\n\nI find the enumeration very revealing Mr President\n\n\nThey are all realizable only if a peace holds\n\n\nMr President who would have thought that the giant responsible for\ndecades of anti-capitalist propaganda and one of the foremost critic of the\nWestern money economy would one day hold a free-market superpower America\nperplexed at the power of its own currency\n\n\nWho would dared  imagine the\nWestern currency speculators included that China could hold by its pocket an\nAmerica fearing the slightest movement of the U N\n\n\nChina underwent two massive disarmaments and later switched from an\nold-time preparedness against a large-scale war of aggression to peacetime\nconstruction\n\n\nIts defense budget is minuscule compared to the other great powers\n\n\nMr President worldwide it is cooperating in the U N and in other\nmultilateral initiatives designed to control the spread of nuclear weapons\nprevent arms race in outer space destroy biological weapons suspend export of\nanti-personnel landmines and reduce the forces in border and on non-first use\nof nuclear weapons\n\n\nChina has also agreed with neighbors to refrain from staging\nmilitary exercises directing against the other and restrictsi restrictions\nmilitary exercises as to scale area and the number of such military exercises\n\n\nDespise  its multilateral peace efforts\nChina is still feared\n\n\nMr President some persist in fanning the fear of a Chinese invasion\nand to a certain extent it is indeed worrisome that there exists such a big\narmy without a declared enemy and moreover construction of structures and\noccupation of certain areas without agreements fuel doubts and apprehensions\n\n\nWhile fighting off U S rebuke of its human rights record China was\ntaking in the lessons so magnified in its decision to preserve Hong Kong the\ncrown jewel of mercantilism at as the port of global trade\n\n\nChina understands the strategic value of not waging a war that will\ndissipitate dissipate its resources for it is to construct ports or deploy\ntroops in overseas bases would detract from its benign deportment that it had\npainstakingly sustained through extreme self-restraint\n\n\nIn addition the feared Asian giant is as much threatened by factors\nof instability if we can only care to read through its defense strategy\n\n\nWith regards to China Mr President I believe that foremost in the U\nS priority is its economic potential as when the U S sent its\nstraight-shooting Albright to join its Trade Secretary to propound America 's\ninterest\n\n\nIt is one it is but one example that the U S itself took cognizance\nthat an engagement or any  any rising rivalry with China would\nhave to be waged sustained and resolved within economic terms and not in a\nfiery war\n\n\nNow Mr President should we be afraid of China\n\n\nToday a search for relevant foreign relations initiatives I\nreiterate my belief that while conflicts have ceased to be waged on\nideological grounds we need to forge security alliances\n\n\nThe new global dynamic is anchored on the protection of national\ninterests of great powers such as those of Japan China Russia and some other\nEuropean states", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "df7205c2-3d1f-425e-8ce3-4303b900f3cb", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nMr President esteemed colleagues this is a privileged moment\nfor me to make history today together with all of you as we cast our vote in\nwhat could either be the most glorious or the most ignominious way to welcome\nthe millennium\n\n\nThis is also a moment of truth for me a golden opportunity to\nfinally bare my innermost thoughts and feelings indeed my very soul on an\nissue whose resolution will mark a turning point in the destiny of our nation\n\n\nArriving at a final decision did not come easy for me\n\n\nIt was something I carefully deliberated on earnestly prayed over\nargued and discussed vigorously and even persistently debated over with those\nwhose wisdom and counsel I value most\n\n\nI have been warned cajoled pressured to take the beaten path to\nfollow the majority as nothing I could say or do can alter the equation\n\n\nIndeed the weight of my resolve bears heavily upon me\n\n\nFor going against the grain I am disregarding the earnest pleas and\nadvice of family and friends including that of my beloved husband Tony all of\nwhom I dearly love honor and respect\n\n\nAs I cast my vote today Mr President I ask for their understanding\nand compassion for I must vote the way my conscience dictates\n\n\nOnly then can I be worthy of my truly mandated task\n\n\n Mula nang ako ay pumalaot sa larangan ng pulitika naging\npanuntunan ko na na isaalang-aalang ang kapakanan ng inang bayan higit pa po\nsa sarili  \n\n\nI could not see how I can be true to myself or to anyone especially\nto the Filipino people who have placed their trust in me if I could not be\ntrue to myself\n\n\nThe die is cast Mr President and on this blessed day at five\nthirteen I declare that I cannot in conscience give my concurrence to Senate\nResolution four four three\n\n\nMr President I vote a resounding \" no \" to the\nVisiting Forces Agreement\n\n\n\" No \" to an Agreement that is lamentably\nunconstitutional no to a grossly flawed ominously vague and decidedly\none-sided Agreement\n\n\nI vote \" no \" Mr President to the Visiting Forces\nAgreement because I believe it is unfair and oppressive to the Filipino\npeople\n\n\n Hindi po ako sumasang-ayon sa isang kasunduang mapang-api\nmakapagpapahamak at walang idudulot na kabutihan sa sambayanang Pilipino\n\n \n\n\nMy vote Mr President is a vote for national sovereignty that can\nneither be waived nor compromised in order to give preferential treatment to\nforeign troops or subordinated to any claim of national security or political\nexigency\n\n\nMy vote is a vote for the Constitution and its unequivocal mandate\nfor a nuclear-free country\n\n\nMy vote is a vote for the environment an area of deep abiding and\npersonal concern so that we may avoid reliving the tragedy of the past\nmilitary bases which left behind a scourge of toxic contaminants that has\nbred disease and death in many communities in the former base lands\n\n\nMr President let us get it straight\n\n\nI am not against the Americans\n\n\nI am not even against a Visiting Forces Agreement but I am Mr\nPresident and have always been strongly against the way this treaty is\npresently drafted and worded\n\n\nI believe Mr President that this document is onerous and fatally\ndeficient in providing adequate protection for our own national interest\n\n\nMr President I may not possess the legal brilliance of many of our\ndistinguished colleagues nor am I gifted with the advantage of age and\npolitical experience but this I know Mr President that the Agreement violates\nthe Philippine Constitution both in letter and in spirit\n\n\nTherefore I cannot find honor in something that makes a farce of\nall that we have been taught about the universal standards of fairness\njustice law and equality\n\n\nTo borrow the words of one of the magnificent twelve who described\nthe rejected bases pact of nineteen ninety-one it is indeed a masterpiece of\nvagueness as if it were a virtue to confuse our people\n\n\nI humbly urge my senior colleagues to work for the renegotiation of\na new agreement for bilateral defense cooperation one where the provisions\nare unmistakably fair clear and binding for both parties\n\n\nThis we should do not only so that we may abide by our own\nConstitution and our laws but more significantly so that we can keep our\ndignity and self-respect as a people\n\n\nWe must not repeat the mistakes of the past\n\n\nWe must not allow any more of our women to be raped\n\n\nFilipinos whom they denigratingly called scavengers to be used as\nhuman targets by servicemen who have gone scot-free and what about the many\nabandoned Amerasian children they all cry out for justice\n\n\n Huwag po tayong magbingi-bingihan huwag po tayong\nmagbulag-bulagan  \n\n\nLet us also not forget that until now the United States whose\nmilitary forces have been described by \" Newsweek \" as the\nmost pervasive and the most protected polluter has ignored its legal and\ninternational obligations to clean up the toxic waste which it has left\nbehind in its former military bases\n\n\nThe destructive and debilitating toxic situation in Clark and Subic\nmust not must never be replicated in other areas of the Philippines\n\n\nThe renewed onslaught of war games threaten to leave behind a trail\nof similar devastation in our forests and mountains in our beaches and\nwetlands\n\n\nI have been Mr President to some of the thirty sites identified by\nvarious studies as heavily contaminated\n\n\nI saw hapless children born with missing fingers and deformed\nbodies and young lives slowly and painfully being consumed by cancer\n\n\nI heard their mothers cry and plead for deliverance from this\nharrowing nightmare\n\n\nThe residents of these communities live each day struggling to\nsurvive against the very elements that they need to exist the water they\ndrink the air they breathe the land where they grow their crops and where\ntheir homes are built\n\n\nThe sight the sound and the stench of death and disease hang\nheavily upon them and all we can do to assuage their grief is to demand that\nthe U S be made to take responsibility for its actions and make reparation\nunder the polluter must pay principle\n\n\nAfter today Mr President I will continue to take up the cudgels to\npress for the clean-up of the former military bases\n\n\nMonths ago I have written Sen John Sheffield the head of the U S\nSenate Environment Committee about the problems and I received a reply last\nApril twelve that they will study the matter\n\n\nI trust that even after my adverse vote the U S will keep its doors\nopen when we present our case to them\n\n\nI believe that true friendship does not hinge on a piece of paper\nbut upon the recognition of mutual rights and obligations\n\n\nThis necessarily includes a shared concern for the environment and\nfor the sanctity of human life\n\n\nMr President I have great faith in the United States of America and\nits people\n\n\nBound by a history of shared ideals and aspirations I am confident\nthat we can come to a mutual understanding and a resolution of our\ndifferences\n\n\nI believe we can achieve national security with the United States\nunder an atmosphere of mutual respect and cooperation\n\n\nWe should have a partnership between equals not an alliance of\nsubservience\n\n\nWe need a treaty of cooperation not a pact of subjugation\n\n\nAs a student of national security Mr President I realize how\nfragile peace is and how ambition can transcend national borders to provoke\nconflict\n\n\nBut the V F A is not the solution to our external security problem\n\n\nThe solution lies in diplomacy not in rattling sabers and\nprecipitating aggression\n\n\nThe era is past when national security and stability can simply be\ndefined as involving freedom from war or securing the national territory from\nexternal aggression\n\n\nNational security and stability must now be based on the resolution\nof basic social economic and political problems that breed poverty inequity\nand injustice\n\n\nMr President the greatest battle we have to fight now is not\noutside our shores but deep within us\n\n\nOur greatest enemy is a defeatist view that has kept us hostage in\nour own fears\n\n\nWhen will we overcome this culture of mendicancy that allows the\ndumping of obsolete and expensive war materiel in our country simply because\nwe have lost the will to provide for ourselves\n\n\nThe last eight years  disproved our fears\n\n\nWe have seen that for as long as we have faith in the capacity and\nresilience of our people we can be equal to the challenge of growth\n\n\nWe have also proven that we can prosper better in freedom and\nindependence a proud nation that forges onward without the yoke of servility\nand stand boldly for the rights and welfare of its citizens\n\n\nMr President there is life after the bases just as we should\nrealize that the commonality of interests between the Philippines and the\nUnited States did not cease with the removal of the military bases in\nnineteen ninety-one\n\n\nIn fact three years after the pull-out the U S remains to be our\nmajor export market even as our own armed forces continues to purchase\narmaments and receive training from America\n\n\nMr President it is barely a year since our nation celebrated one\nhundred years of freedom as a republic\n\n\nShall we destroy that spirit and purpose of the Centennial by\nbeginning a new century a new millennium with a vote that would negate the\nideals of freedom and independence which we gained at the cost of the lives\nof our valiant forebears\n\n\nHistory Mr President would be unforgiving\n\n\n Huwag po nating sayangin ang kasarinlan na pinagbuwisan ng\nbuhay ng ating mga magigiting na ninuno  \n\n\nAs the youngest senator in this august body I speak for the youth\nas I cast my vote today\n\n\nThis vote is their vote Mr President\n\n\nWe the youth vote for honor and self-respect\n\n\nWe vote to live in dignity and freedom\n\n\nWe vote to assert our right to a sovereign future\n\n\nTherefore Mr President we vote \" no \" a million\ntimes \" no \" to this Visiting Forces Agreement\n\n\nToday as we cast our vote let us take time to remember with pride\nthe heroic rejection by the Philippine Senate of the onerous U S Military\nBases Agreement in nineteen ninety-one and on this day let us relive that\nglorious moment in our history as we proudly confirm our independence as a\nnation\n\n\nMr President our vote is \" no \" \n\n\n Maraming salamat po at mabuhay ang sambayanang Pilipino\n\n  \n\n \n\n<$A>  \n\n\nMr President on several occasions in the past I have uh voted on\nissues presented before the Senate guided only by the principle that I vote\nfreely and rationally according to my conscience and the public interest\n\n\nLast I voted years back for the re-imposition of the of the death\npenalty and I voted for the rejection of the Uruguay round on the General\nAgreement on Tariff and Trade\n\n\nI was with the majority in the former and I was with the minority\nin the latter\n\n\nToday I cast my vote on a matter of importance to our people\nguided only by conscience reason and the public interest  \n\n\nWith the indulgence of my colleagues Mr President allow me to\nexplain my vote\n\n\nThe issue at hand may be likened to the question of whether or not\nwe want a certain group to come and visit us\n\n\nThe door keeper is the Senate and the home owner of course is the\nFilipino people\n\n\nWhether the door keeper in the exercise of delegated authority from\nthe home owner opens or shuts the door proves only one thing that it has\npower over the entry of the visitor\n\n\nIt is therefore wrong to say that to allow the visitor to come in\nis a surrender of power\n\n\nAnd in case the visitor proves herself himself not a pleasant one\nshe can always be asked to leave as she did once leave in nineteen ninety-one\n\n\n Itong visitor na ito'y sumusunod  \n\n\nBut the big picture is that this is really a tale of two visits\n\n\n  'Yung isa ay kumakatok at nagpapaalam pumasok\n\n\n'Yung isa naman nakapasok na sa ating bakuran nagtayo na ng\nkanyang kabahayan at nag-aalok pang bumisita tayo sa kanilang itinayong\nbahayan\n\n\nAng sabi pa nila kung gusto nating makibahagi sa anumang kayamanan\nng kalikasang matatagpuan doon ay maaari naman daw tayong bumisita\n\n\nKung maari nga lang huwag daw nating papapasukin yung kumakatok na\nkagalit nila   \n\n\nOne visitor is knocking on our door while the other an intruder\nactually had entered and built a shanty within our compound without knocking\nat the door of the Senate\n\n\nThis shanty grew into a structure of strong materials worse that\nintruder had claimed the lot as his own and says we must not allow the\nvisitor knocking on our door to enter\n\n\nAnd I am disheartened that those who oppose the entry of the\nvisitor knocking at our door do not raise even a small squeak against the sly\nincursion of the intruder\n\n\nWorse the Communist National Democratic Front finds an uncommon\nally in the leadership of the Catholic Church\n\n\nAre the people at our gates the National Democratic Front and the\nCatholic Church exercising selective nationalism\n\n\nWhy do they not demonstrate in front of the Chinese Embassy in the\nPhilippines against this intrusion\n\n\nWhy is the Catholic Church following the line of the National\nDemocratic Front\n\n\nDo their leaders not see anything wrong from the activities of the\nChinese in the Mischief Reef\n\n\n They have even raised issues on would-be prostitution but I\nwonder why they have never raised the issues or raised against prostitution\nin Binondo Bocaue Culi-culi <unclear> 1 word </unclear>  \n\n\nMr President the Visiting Forces Agreement is about giving\nFilipino soldiers and civilians not only the requisite military training for\nthe defense of the country but also cooperation in relief and rescue\noperations and environmental protection and other developmental programs in\ntimes of peace\n\n\nThen the question arises\n\n\nWhy should we train with the United States\n\n\n E bakit diyan sa mga Kano  \n\n\nThe truth Mr President is obvious\n\n\nThey have the equipment the latest technology and they are willing\nto train us\n\n\nOthers may have the equipment but they belong to the other side of\nthe ideological spectrum\n\n\nWe don't expect to be trained by our enemies\n\n\nSome young Filipinos say we must not enter into such an agreement\nbut I dare say that millions of our youth in the schools and at their homes\nthink otherwise\n\n\nFor any miscalculation on our part will put their lives on the\nline\n\n\nIn spite of the high tech nature of the wars of tomorrow the dying\nstill has to be suffered by the young soldiers of the Republic\n\n\nWe cannot be sitting ducks of future invaders\n\n\nWe must defend ourselves\n\n\nIf we do not train with new technology now we cannot play a\nsignificant role in our country 's defense\n\n\nThe art of warfare has changed from David 's sling shot to the\nlaser-guided intelligent bombs that can hit targets as small as a golf ball\nanywhere in the world\n\n\nIn spite of our intense nationalism and pride as a people we must\nwake up to the reality of our lack of adequate military equipment\n\n\nThe Filipino people in my humble perception Mr President are\npredominantly in favor of a military alliance with the United States for the\nsimple reason that in spite of our differences we are not prepared to defend\nourselves in case of external aggression\n\n\nAnd I always worry about external aggression especially about this\nintruder visitor every time I read the book of Revelations chapters sixteen\nto twenty\n\n\nMr President let us look to the future with hope rather than look\nback in fear of what have gone wrong with our relations with the United\nStates\n\n\nThe Filipino veterans are for V F A because they have seen the\nhigh cost of human lives and property for unpreparedness during the second\nWorld War when we lost one million lives and lived through hell for three\nyears\n\n\nThe Filipino soldiers are for V F A because as we debate here in\nthe Senate they are out there in the hills and mountains fighting and dying\nfor us against Communist groups who are at times better equipped and trained\nthan our very own warriors\n\n\nThe silent but no less patriotic Filipino youth are for V F A as\nthey go about their daily task of studying in our schools for their own\nfuture\n\n\nThe ruling class of the Catholic Church in the Philippines the\nCatholic Bishops Conference in the Philippines is against V F A\n\n\nBut the Catholic  masa  the  El Shaddai\n\n whose economic class mirrors that of our Filipino soldiers are in\nfavor of V F A\n\n\nThe ordinary Filipino soldier wishes to ally with the forces of\ndemocracy in this part of the world\n\n\nMr President we can choose to be romantic and claim we need no\ntraining or joint exercises with the Americans\n\n\n  E kanino tayo makikipag-training\n\n\nAno huwag na lang tayong mag-training para e talagang para tayong\nnakatihaya sa kalaban\n\n\nE nagbago na ho ang mundo Mr President\n\n\nPati China nga nagbago na rin ng pananaw e\n\n\nYun po yung McDonalds eh gusting-gusto na ho sa Bejing ang lakas\nng benta\n\n\nAng communist Vietnam ay umaakit na ng foreign investment\n\n\nSamantalang tayo nakakulong pa sa lumang kaisipan ng Komunismo\n\n\nYung mga debateng ginagamit na narinig natin sabi nga ni Senator\nJohn Osme&ntilde;a ay dadagdagan ko mga lumang tugtugin na kumita na Mr\nPresident   \n\n\nTo be anti-American does not necessarily mean being pro-Filipino\n\n\nI choose to be pro-Filipino even it if it means training for the\ndefense of this country with an American\n\n\nThe late Communist

{"text": "<$A> \n\nMr President on a speck of land in the blue waters of the\nMediterranean in the Greek island of Corfu lies the grave of a young man and\non his headstone is carved the epitaph  I want nothing I fear nothing\nI am free  \n\n\nAnd when I was in the military stockade of the dictator where I\nspent almost five years of my life exacerbated by having to listen day in and\nday out on radio and television to pompous and pontificating propagandists\nspew forth lie after lie half truth after half truth phrases like  sa\nikauunlad ng bayan disiplina ang kailangan  or there is not a single\npolitical prisoner in this country I found courage and inspiration from the\nwords of the great Mahatma Gandhi who said  the first condition of\nfreedom is freedom from fear  \n\n\nAnd it was only then and when I was able to inten internalize this\ndictum that I began to realize that prison bars do not enslave a man it is\nhis fears that do\n\n\nMan 's most basic instinct is the instinct for survival and\ncorollary to that man 's greatest fear is the fear of destruction of death\n\n\nThus it became my personal program to face the issue of dying and\nthe fear of death\n\n\nFirst I came to acknowledge that life is a matter of trade-offs and\nthat there were certain things in life which are so unendurable unbearable\nthat death or the risk of dying would be preferable\n\n\nThe immortal Ninoy Aquino was able to capsulize this powerful\nfeeling in a single sentence when he declared  I would rather die on\nmy feet like a man than continue to live on bended knees like a slave\n\n \n\n\nAnd it was this precept which spurred my cellmate Geny and I to go\non a hunger strike in November nineteen seventy-four to demand the release of\npolitical prisoners and when one thousand and twenty-four detainees were\ngiven their release on December fourth Geny and I broke our fast\n\n\nThe hunger strike lasted for ten days\n\n\nAnd it was this belief this passion to be free that on September\nthirty nineteen seventy-seven gave us the courage to risk death and undertake\na daring escape from the maximum security unit of Fort Bonifacio\n\n\nMr President during the past several months the Filipino people\nhave been bombarded with half truths and outrageous lies wittingly or\nunwittingly by pro-V F A propagandists\n\n\nQuarter page ads in news dailies had been paid by whose monies we\nstill do not know to instill fear in the Filipino people that the nation now\nfaces the immediate threat of an invasion by Chinese hordes from the mainland\n\n\nAs proof they cited the construction of a small unsightly building\non a tiny atoll one hundred and thirty-five miles from the shores of Palawan\na building that is so small that it would be unable to contain a garrison of\nmore than fifty soldiers in cramped fashion\n\n\nThe presence of a tiny Chinese garrison on Mischief Reef combined\nwith the passage by the National People 's Congress of a law declaring that\nthe entire South China Sea belongs to China has been utilized with a limited\namount of success I must admit to cause a number of Filipinos to support the\nreturn of American soldiers modified by the vague and nebulous adjective\n\n\" visiting forces \" \n\n\nThe Visiting Forces Agreement is necessary the proponents say to\noperationalize the Mutual Defense Treaty of nineteen fifty-one\n\n\nThey insist that our soldiers need to be trained by American\nsoldiers in the use of the latest state-of-the-art weaponry as if the\nPhilippines could afford to buy destroyers and frigates and submarines and\nlaser-guided bombs delivered by F eighteen Hornets or F sixteen Falcons P\nthree Orion planes anti-submarine patrol helicopters Tomahawk cruise missiles\nHawkeye missiles and much much less an intercontinental ballistic missile or\nmaybe a fourth-hand aircraft carrier\n\n\nBecause this is what it will take to stop a Chinese invasion or\neven neutralize them in the Spratlys\n\n\nRoughly I estimate in my amateur defense way one hundred billion U\nS dollars\n\n\nIt is like your neighbor teaching you how to drive a Ferrari but\nwhen you go home you have no Ferrari in your garage to drive\n\n\nThe proponents have continuously and loudly alleged that the\npresence of the Chinese on Mischief Reef constitutes a clear and present\ndanger to the free and unhampered passage of commercial ships in the area and\nto the security of the East Asian region\n\n\nEven while the U S Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and\nPacific Affairs otherwise known as America 's point man in Asia Mr Stanley\nRoth declared in Davo Switzerland only last February nineteen ninety-nine\nthat and I quote Mr Roth  It is important not to overstate the\nsituation  referring to the Spratlys dispute between Manila and\nBeijing  while at the same time not to underestimate the need to get\nsome resolution\n\n\n There has been a lot of publicity recently which might suggest\nthat freedom of navigation is at risk because of new construction by Chinese\nat Mischief Reef\n\n\nIn fact the building is in no way a fundamental threat to security\n\n  \n\n\nAnd I repeat Mr Roth said this  the building on Mischief\nReef is in fact no way a fundamental threat to security\n\n\n The fact is that the United States Navy transits the region all\nthe time\n\n\nIt is disappointing that China chose to build  he said\n\n it appears to be at odds with commitments they have given the\nPhilippines previously and certainly with a notion of resolving by peaceful\nmeans the many disputed claims   \n\n\nThe proponents of the V F A have continuously pounded away at us\ntheir belief that the Mutual Defense Treaty must now be strengthened by the\napproval of the V F A in order to provide our country with the security\nshield that will protect us from China in spite of the fact that the Mutual\nDefense Treaty does not, repeat not, contain an automatic retaliatory\nclause in case the Philippines is attacked that it is in fact an empty\npromise which American propagandists have used to their advantage for\nforty-eight years to gain concessions from the Filipinos\n\n\nIndeed only last week the Pentagon 's equivalent of Assistant\nSecretary Roth  the Commander-in-Chief of all U S\nArmed Forces in the Pacific better known as CINCPAC Admiral Dennis Blair\ndeclared in Singapore that the V F A and I quote in his thinking it is not a\nsecurity guarantee or a big signal on the issues mentioned\n\n\nI have repeatedly maintained that the proponents of the V F A have\nbeen making promises on behalf of the Americans and have been exaggerating\nthe danger posed by a tiny Chinese garrison at Mischief Reef or by the\ncommitment of the United States to come to the defense of our country if and\nwhen attacked\n\n\nIt would seem to me and to many that if the proponents of the V F A\nutilized these arguments in America they would be laughed out of the United\nStates Senate\n\n\nThe officials of various departments who testified during the\nhearings have maintained that because the Philippines has not had to invoke\nthe Mutual Defense Treaty in the past is proof enough that the M D T has been\neffective and one official even said that even if the Philippines is able to\nbluff the Chinese that the possibility alone I 'm not talking about\nprobability but possibility alone that the U S might might come to our\nassistance because of the fact that we have the M D T should be enough to\ndeter the Chinese from engaging in more aggressive actions in the Spratlys\n\n\nWell the candid comments of Admiral Blair threw off any pretense of\nU S intentions although Ambassador Hubbard was quick to deny that uhm that\nAdmiral Blair did not say what Admiral Blair indeed said\n\n\nAnd how else do we did we expect Ambassador Hubbard to react\n\n\nAdmiral Blair up to now has not corrected his statement\n\n\nLast week in my   turno en contra   I\nlike the small boy in the Hans Christian Andersen tale declared the Emperor\nhas no clothes\n\n\nToday as I listen to the various explanations of votes by our\ndistinguished colleagues I could not but come to the conclusion that the\nChinese know we are bluffing that we know that the Chinese know we are\nbluffing but that we hope that the Filipino people do not know that the\nChinese know that we are bluffing about the M D T\n\n\nBut as a philosopher once said  in war truth is the first\ncasualty  and since the proponents of the V F A have engendered in\nour people the fear of impending war with China all logic reason common sense\nand balanced judgment have been thrown out the window\n\n\nThe problem I have always maintained is not whether we should\noperationalize the M D T but whether America has a real commitment to our\ndefense\n\n\nThe problem also is whether V F A costs too much in terms of our\nnational dignity and honor\n\n\nThe debate is not over the need to maintain security alliances with\nfriendly countries like the United States or Australia or the United Kingdom\nor France or Canada but to maintain such alliances while maintaining our\nself-respect\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Senate comprised of only\ntwenty-three men and women elected at large to play a countervailing role to\nthe Executive Department in matters of treaties\n\n\nIt is our role to play the bad cop to the Executive 's good cop\n\n\nI possess some amount of sympathy for the members of the Executive\nDepartment who have been bullied by almighty America into ratifying such a\none-sided Agreement\n\n\nThe pressure must have been tremendous\n\n\nOur pending structural adjustment loans from the World Bank the\napprovals of the I M F for our financial plans loans from the Asian\nDevelopment Bank our sugar and garment quotas must have been bashed over the\nheads of our leaders and as Lyndon Baines Johnson so aptly described his\nphilosophy  if you 've got them by the balls their minds and hearts\nwill follow  \n\n\nAnd I guess our decision is now limited to two options to either\nhave our balls fondled by the Americans or crushed by the Chinese\n\n\nBut as the revered nationalist and former light of the Senate Jose\nW Diokno once asked  if we have to give up our virtue can we not at\nleast check if their dollar is counterfeit  I had also asked the\nSenate not as an eleventh hour excuse to derail the V F A but to protect our\nchildren in Pampanga and Zambales\n\n\nOur distinguished colleague the Senator from Batangas and Antique\nhas already articulated the heartaches and the miseries that toxic and\nhazardous wastes have caused are causing and will continue to cause poor\nfamilies most of them already victims of Mount Pinatubo 's  lahar\n\n \n\n\nOver twenty thousand families have lived in the  Cabcom  \nevacuation center for an average of one to four years\n\n\nAnd considerable harm from toxic and hazardous wastes had been done\nto them especially to pregnant women\n\n\nThe Americans did not even inform the Philippine authorities of\npotential risk of water contem contamination\n\n\nIf they had only warned us many deaths could have been prevented\nand so many lives would not have been destroyed because we would not have\nallowed the evacuees to occupy that particular area in Clark\n\n\nEarlier the distinguished Senator from Laguna from Cagayan I 'm\nsorry repeated the final lines of our National Anthem and perhaps in honor of\nall past present and future victims of toxic wastes especially the innocent\nchildren we should rephrase our Anthem  Silang mamatay nang dahil sa\nKano  \n\n\nIn concurring in the ratification of the V F A we are waiving the\nrights of our children to a happy and healthy life in the future\n\n\nThe Senate can still prevent this by using the V F A to get the\nUnited States of America to own up to their moral responsibility to make\nthings right and to prevent more children being born mentally retarded with\nphysical deformities with cancer leading to a life of misery and a painful\ndeath\n\n\nLet not the U S continue to bluff us into believing that trade and\ninvestment will suffer if the V F A is not concurred in by the Senate\n\n\nIt was after the bases were closed in nineteen ninety-two that\ninvestments in our country grew by leaps and bounds\n\n\nNobody in the Senate has so far disputed those statistics\n\n\nThe American businessman my friends like any investor will go\nanywhere where he can make a profit regardless of what his government\npolicies are\n\n\nIn America my friends it is the businessmen and not the politicians\nwho dictate policy\n\n\nI have read much researched much studied much analyzed much in\npreparing for the V F A debates\n\n\nI have tried to perform my duty as a Senator of the Republic as God\ngives me the light to see that duty\n\n\nI wish to express my appreciation to the leadership of this chamber\nwho have conducted proceedings with fairness dignity and decorum\n\n\nAnd also to the distinguished sponsors and co-sponsor who have been\nkind patient and understanding I 've been privileged to interact with all of\nyou\n\n\nBut I must vote \" no \" to a one-sided agreement\nthat is an insult to our national honor and which will remove from us the one\nsingle trump card that will save thousands of children in Pampanga and\nZambales\n\n\nAs a statesman once said  I would rather lose in a cause\nthat I know someday will triumph than to triumph in a cause that I know\nsomeday will fail  \n\n\nIt is obvious to us that the concurrence of the Senate in the\nratification of the V F A is inevitable\n\n\nAnd if we were to take the path of least resistance we may perhaps\nfollow the advice of a former Secretary of Foreign Affairs who said  \nIf rape is inevitable relax and enjoy it  \n\n\nBut Mr President the Senate has no right to make that answer on\nbehalf of Filipino women and children\n\n\nAnd I shall not relax and enjoy I shall continue to fight for our\npeople especially women and children for the right to live lives of dignity\nand good health if not happiness\n\n\nThe Scottish philosopher Thomas Carlyle was once asked by one of\nhis students  If you could encapsulate the wisdom of the ages in one\nsentence how would that sentence read  \n\n\nCarlyle thought for a few minutes and he answered  I cannot\ngive it to you in one sentence but I can give it to you in four and they are\none whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad two the bee pollinizes\nthe flower that it steals the honey from three the wheels of justice grind\nexceedingly slow but they grind exceedingly fine and four it is only when it\ngets dark enough that you can see the stars  \n\n\nAnd at this beginning of another benighted period in our country 's\nhistory I shall take time from now on to peer up into the heavens to look at\nthe stars because to me they are the Filipino children\n\n\nThank

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThank you Mr President\n\n\nMr President we gather here today in search of peace security and\nwelfare of the Filipino people\n\n\nThey elected us to this august Chamber to discharge our\nConstitutional duties one of the most important of which is to ratify or\nreject treaties or international agreements that have vital influence in\ntheir lives and fortune\n\n\nMr President and distinguished colleagues outside this hall are\nrallies demonstrations and loud protests of our people holding divergent\nviews seeking to sway our decision\n\n\nIn a democratic institution like ours we encourage them to do so\nbecause the people must be free to choose their own future without fear or\nfavor without dictation or domination without suppression or subversion\n\n\nBut guided by our obligation to secure their safety freedom and\nprogress as Divine Providence gives us to see the light we cast our vote\ntoday in accordance with our conscience unafraid of the indictment of\nposterity\n\n\nLet history be the final judge of our deeds\n\n\nWe are called upon to accept or reject Senate Resolution Number four\nfour three under Committee Report Number forty-two which declares its\nconcurrence on the Visiting Forces Agreement between the government of the\nPhilippines and the government of the United States\n\n\nIt must be pointed out that we have an existing Mutual Defense\nTreaty with the United States signed in nineteen fifty-one\n\n\nWe could have renounced it after the Senate rejected the proposed\nTreaty of Friendship Economic Cooperation and Security with the United States\nin nineteen ninety-one\n\n\nBut we did not because that was not our intention\n\n\nDespite the bases pull-out we chose to keep the M D T because the\nneed to maintain the security alliances with the most powerful nation in the\nworld must remain\n\n\nIn the present circumstances prudence dictates that we give\nsubstance and effect to the R P - U S Mutual Defense Treaty through the\nconcurrence of the Senate in the Visiting Forces Agreement\n\n\nThe V F A is not crafted to recolonize the Philippines or to\nresurrect the foreign bases that we had discarded\n\n\nVoting for it does not mean a surrender of our sovereignty\n\n\nIt simply permits the short troop visits upon approval by our\ngovernment for purposes of joint military exercises to ensure our security\nrelationship under the aforesaid Treaty\n\n\nTo ordinary citizens this gey this gathering may have little or no\nreal impact on their daily struggle for their survival\n\n\nYet in the life of our beloved nation today 's event holds\nsurpassing meaning and unprecedented significance destined to etch in our\ncountry 's history\n\n\nMr President distinguished colleagues in the Senate I stand here\ntoday on behalf of seventy million Filipinos whose future depends on the\nsecurity of our shores and the sustenance of their livelihood\n\n\nI come here today to cast my vote a vote that embraces the lesson\nof history and takes careful consideration of learned opinions of legal and\npolitical experts on this Agreement requiring our sound judgment\n\n\nWe are at a time of relative peace we are not a country at war\n\n\nBut we should not let this lull us into a false sense of security\nbecause the string that holds this peace is weak\n\n\nFor while we are peace-loving people willing to go the extra mile\nfor peace there are also those willing to go the extra mile to disturb that\npeace\n\n\nThe greatest threat to this fragile state of security in fact lies\nin slumber only a few hundred nautical miles away from our shores\n\n\nMr President today we make another hard and momentous decision for\nour people one that seeks to guarantee that peace continue to reign a peace\nthat is crucial in sustaining our gains as a nation and leading us toward the\nnext millennium where we can match  stride  with most prosperous\neconomies and countries of the world\n\n\nDeciding the fate of the Visiting Forces Agreement I believe is a\nchoice between preserving that peace or treading the path toward a future of\nuncertainty\n\n\nPeople say that our decision today would either set us back to the\ntime when we were ruled by foreign colonizers or affirm the independence we\nhave achieved when the last warship in Subic Bay the helicopter carrier  \nBella Wood  sailed out of Philippine waters\n\n\nIt is the obligation of the Senate according to the critics of the\nV F A to preserve the gains we have achieved in nineteen ninety-one when we\nthrew the military bases out of the country and finally ended the last form\nof foreign domination in our country\n\n\nMr President I am all for keeping and fighting for independence and\nsovereignty\n\n\nA brief look of history would show that my family had been deeply\ninvolved in the elusive quest for freedom from foreign rule\n\n\nMy grandfather fought the Americans during the Philippine war for\nindependence the centennial of which we are celebrating this year\n\n\nMy father was a delegate during the passage of the\nHare-Hawes-Cutting Law and the Tydings-McDuffie Law which paved the way for\nPhilippine Independence from the United States\n\n\nMy brother Ninoy who was erroneously tagged as an Amboy by his\ndetractors maintained his position for Philippine sovereignty although the\n\n the United States provided him refuge from the dictator\n\n\nAnother brother Butz as a Senator cast his vote against the\ncontinued stay of the U S bases in nineteen ninety-one despite the pro-bases\nstand taken by our sister-in-law the former President\n\n\nNow it is my turn to make a choice\n\n\nMr President every generation must write a new kind of history\n\n\nTimes have changed\n\n\nToday 's challenges are different\n\n\nThey are of a broader kind\n\n\nThey are of a global nature\n\n\nThe choice I am about to make and the circumstances that surround\nit differ from those on which the members of my family based their option\n\n\nBut we are one in principle\n\n\nWe are entering a new millennium when there is a great economic\ncompetition fueled by the dizzying pace of technological advances\n\n\nBut with progress comes more threats to our national security\n\n\nThese threats have to be confronted now not with a narrow\nnationalism but with a broader perspective of cooperation and mutual support\n\n\nThis is where alliances treaties and agreements like the V F A will\ncome in\n\n\nBut before we talk about what the V F A can do for us it is\nnecessary first to discuss what it cannot do\n\n\nThe V F A alone cannot provide us military dominance the V F A\nalone cannot bring us economic progress and more importantly the V F A alone\ncannot prevent any foreign act of aggression\n\n\nRegional security will largely depend on the number of bilateral\nalliances and agreements\n\n\nThe U S presence in the Asia Pacific is anchored on treaties and\nsecurity agreements with countries like the Philippines Thailand Singapore\nIndonesia Malaysia and Brunei with similar arrangement on the status of\nforces\n\n\nOne thing is certain Mr President we need friends we need allies\n\n\nWith friends and allies we can collectively guarantee our regional\nsecurity and stability\n\n\nNot many will agree with the idea of a superpower like the United\nStates extending its reaches in our region\n\n\nI am one of those who believe that our security as a nation our\nsovereignty should be defended and upheld by the Filipino people neither\nthrough the might of a superpower nor the cover of a military alliance\n\n\nMr President I realize that we are fifteen years and several\nbillions of pesos away from becoming truly able to defend our borders and\nprotect our people from external aggression\n\n\nWe lack the time and resources to assure our people that we can\nuphold our sovereignty in the complex environment that exists today\n\n\nAnd it is our responsibility to make sure that our people be\nprovided the means to make to have a secure future\n\n\nThat is why I have opened my mind to forging military alliances\nwith the United States\n\n\nIt is in the larger context of peace that we have to ratify this\nAgreement\n\n\nThe R P - U S Mutual Defense Treaty is an  is an\neffective deterrent against ambitious neighboring countries\n\n\nEvery potential aggressor is put on notice that any aggression\nagainst the Philippines may result in armed confrontation with the United\nStates\n\n\nOur respective forces Armed Forces should be given the opportunity\nto train together so that there should  be exigencies they can effectively work together as one\nfighting unit\n\n\nThat is what the V F A seeks to accomplish\n\n\nWe share with the Americans a passion for democracy and human\nrights\n\n\nWe fought side by side with them when our freedom was threatened\nduring World War two\n\n\nThe Senate has put in place enough safeguards that would allay\nfears and abuses are bound to take place\n\n\nOne of which is the creation of Legislative Oversight Committee\nthat would monitor and oversee this its implementation\n\n\nWe have fo poured our undivided attention and spent urgent critical\ndeliberation on the V F A\n\n\nTwo years were spent by the government of the Philippines and the\ngovernment of the United States in negotiating the V F A\n\n\nLet us give the Agreement a chance and let us give the Filipino\npeople a rare opportunity to pre to prove their capability to uphold this\ntreaty\n\n\nWhile the Agreement took such a long time to study and prepare we\nalso recognize that the V F A is not permanent\n\n\nWhen we are ready we can do away with it and when that time comes I\nwill be one of those cheering at this great achievement of our people of\ntaking complete control of our security\n\n\nFears have been raised Mr President over the possible resurgence of\nprostitution rings with the ratification of the V F A\n\n\nNothing ranks higher in my consideration of the V F A that may  concern for the fate of the women\n\n\nWhen we rejected the U S Bases Treaty in nineteen ninety-one it was\na rejection of the commodification of our women in Angeles and Olongapo\n\n\nRatifying the V F A does not mean that we are allowing our women to\nbe exposed against the same humiliating  vices\n\n\nI say ratify the V F A and pass Senate Bill Number fifteen\nsixty-two or the Anti- Prostitution Act\n\n\nThat proposed measure would decriminalize the prostitute and would\npenalize the reason for the crime the pimp and the buyer\n\n\nPass this bill into law and enforce so whoever engages the services\nof prostitutes be they Filipino American or any other nationality will be\nprosecuted and charged accordingly\n\n\nRejecting the V F A will not solve our country 's problem on\nprostitution\n\n\nWhether the V F A is here or not we will we still have to work very\nhard to provide a solution to this moral and social problem\n\n\nMr President and my dear colleagues I would like to make an appeal\n\n\nA rejection of the V F A would not give the country the respect it\nwants from other independent nations\n\n\nRejecting the V F A would be an act of cowardice and fear a fear of\nthe past and a fear of the unknown\n\n\nRejection would be a silent admission that we are still unable to\nstand on equal footing with other independent countries such as the United\nStates\n\n\nMr President the time has come to show to the whole world that we\ncan hold our own in the community of nations\n\n\nNow is the time to prove that we can see eye to eye with other\ncountries match them stride for stride\n\n\nWe determine our own destiny we can only be dominated if we choose\nto be dominated\n\n\nIn nineteen eighty-six we as a people rose against the domination\nof an oppressive government and despotic ruler\n\n\nIn nineteen ninety-one we again as a people decided against the\ncontinued stay of the U S bases in the country\n\n\nIn nineteen ninety-six we collectively rallied against any form of\nCharter change that would bring the country back to the throes of dictatorial\nrule\n\n\nAnd only last year through our votes we reaffirmed our commitment\nto democracy and put in place a government truly representative of the people 's\nwill a government which truly is our own\n\n\nIn closing Mr President the V F A will not eliminate conflicts it\nwill not put an end to war it will not secure freedom for all\n\n\nBut I cast my vote in favor of Senate Resolution four four three\nconcurring in the Agreement between the governments of the Philippines and\nthe United States regarding the treatment of U S Armed Forces visiting the\nPhilippines\n\n\nI cast my vote in favor of V F A because it will help preserve\npeace\n\n\nAnd the peace that we seek does not rest in treaties and agreements\nor charters and covenants alone\n\n\nIt is the peace that lies also in the hearts and minds of the\nFilipino people\n\n\nLet us therefore ask them to fully support and totally commit to\npreserve our peace and freedom to assure a stable and bright future\n\n\n Mabuhay ang Pilipinas  \n\n\nThank you Mr President  1", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5ffe24ff-5631-4796-a9f4-2a2fa81fed69",

{"text": "<$A> \n\nAllow me first to place on record my observations and remarks\nmade earlier by a colleague that the blame for the sad state of the Armed\nForces should be laid at the door of the Presidency of Corazon C Aquino\nallegedly for giving low priority to their funding requirements\n\n\nI find that conclusion of my dear friend without merit for two\nreasons one when Mrs Aquino assumed the presidency the national treasury had\nbeen looted blind and number two the repeated coup attempts by a significant\nsegment of the armed forces were hardly conducive to enlarging their share of\nthe national budget\n\n\nIn fact Mr President if blame is to be laid on anyone 's shoulder I\nwould say that it should be placed on those who had run of the military\nestablishment for so long but had not been able to enhance its capability for\none reason or another as a fighting force for the security of the nation\n\n\nMr President voting on the V F A is one of the most difficult\ndecisions of my life as a public servant\n\n\nIn nineteen ninety-one I was a member of the Senate along with\nSenator Teofisto Guingona Senator Juan Ponce Enrile and Senator uh John\nOsme&ntilde;a and uh we were faced with a proposal to renew the term of the U\nS military bases in the country\n\n\nSixteen votes were needed to approve a the proposal eight votes were\nneeded to reject it\n\n\nMr President when I rose to cast my \" no \" vote\nmine was the eighth negative vote that irrevocably sealed the doom of the\nproposed renewal of the Bases Agreement\n\n\nI had cast that negative vote with no doubts no qualms of conscience\nno second thoughts about the rightness of my vote\n\n\nI then believe as I do now that the U S bases had to go in the event\n\n\nMr President I believe that history has vindicated our decision to\nask the U S bases to leave\n\n\nI had voted \" no \" despite the repeated requests\nof a dear friend and a political ally the then President Corazon C Aquino\nwith whom I had the privilege of working for the restoration of our people 's\nfreedoms not only when she was already installed as President of the Republic\nbut even during the dark days of Martial rule in our country\n\n\nToday as a Senator I am called upon to decide whether or not our\ncountry should have a Visiting Forces Agreement with the United States of\nAmerica\n\n\nAnd this time another dear friend and political ally no less than\nthe incumbent President Joseph Ejercito Estrada asked that I agree with the\nratification of that Agreement\n\n\nHow I wish Mr President I could decide the issue today as easily as\nI did the proposal of the renewal of the U S bases in nineteen ninety-one\n\n\nThe issue now as I see it however is not a choice between black or\nwhite as was the proposal to retain or reject the U S military bases in\nnineteen ninety-one\n\n\nThe issue now is whether or not we allow the friendly military\nforces of the United States of America which happens to be the only remaining\nsuperpower in the world to visit our country and do military exercises with\nour Armed Forces\n\n\nIn an an attempt in an attempt to be dispassionate about the issue\nI have asked myself a two-pronged question one why does the United States\nwant a V F A with us and number two why do our leaders want to have a V F A\nwith the United States\n\n\nNumber one on the U S motives\n\n\nMr President as U S motives go I venture the following observations\n\n\nFirst the need for access\n\n\nThe U S is by universal admission the only superpower in the world\ntoday\n\n\nFlowing from that pre-eminent status the United States by\nauto-appointment now performs global police work with the deferential\nacquiescence of the rest of the world\n\n\nAs the world 's  de facto  policeman for\ninstance the United States believes that Iraq 's Saddam Hussein is not doing\nright to his people and so it bombs Iraq imposes no fly zones in Iraqi air\nspace and shoots down any plane that dares to defy its rule\n\n\nThe U S does not like what the drug lords in Colombia are doing and\nso it backs up the anti-drug war in the country that has neutralized not only\nthe drug lords but also some political opponents of President Cesar  \nGavria  Trujillo\n\n\nThe United States does not like what Slobodan Milosevic ethnic\ncleansing in Kosovo and so it bombs the daylights out of Belgrade and other\ncities of Yugoslavia\n\n\nWhat I 'm trying to say Mr President is that since the United\nStates is now the only superpower in the world it looks like it it can do\nwhatever it wants to do in the name of humanitarian intervention or to create\na new world order according to its image and likeness\n\n\nNonetheless I think Mr President that the United States is  essentially a democratic country and therefore it wants to ground its\npolice actions on agreements and treaties that are enforceable or justifiable\nunder the law of nations\n\n\nEnforceable agreements or treaties on visiting on U S Visiting\nForces are important to the U S so that any challenge to United  interest in any region could be met under a legal cover and from the\nvantage point of a territory close to the challenger and far away from\nmainland U S A\n\n\nHence I am made to understand that now the United States has V F As\nwith seventy-seven countries around the globe in addition to eighteen\nMilitary Alliances of various sorts\n\n\nThat makes Mr President ninety-five countries out of a total one\nhundred eighty-seven United Nation members\n\n\nRoughly over one half Mr President of the world has become integral\nparts of what somebody has called \" the shifting plates of armor of\nthe United States \" \n\n\nWith the V F As in its pocket Mr President the United States may\nthen legitimately oversee the activities of the world north to south east to\nwest and do police work in this or that country and in this or that region so\nthat they do not conflict with or do damage to U S interests\n\n\nAs George and Meredith Freedman have said the American Navy Mr\nPresident goes where it wants and does what it wants and the American troops\nland in Eurasia and brush aside enemy armies and they intervene in Latin\nAmerica at will for reasons as trivial as arresting drug dealers\n\n\nOf particular relevance to us Mr President in connection with the V\nF A discussion are the sea lanes within or the air spaces above the countries\nof Southeast Asia and other Asian countries\n\n\nFree access to these sea lanes is  considered of\nstrategic importance to the U S because it is through these sea lanes that\nvessels ply their cargo especially oil to fuel the economic demands of Japan\nEurope and even of the United States\n\n\nFree access to the air spaces is likewise of vital importance\nbecause U S war planes that sail along the sea routes of Southeast Asia to\ntheir ultimate destinations elsewhere will need the protection of the United\nStates Air Force\n\n\nThe world view of the United States therefore Mr President dictates\nthat the United States Armed Forces need to oversee and police what the\nnations of the world do in order to ensure the unhampered transaction of\nglobal business of which the United States is the main exponent and principal\nbeneficiary\n\n\nIn a word the name of the game of United States business as it has\nalways been for the business of the dominant powers of Europe or Asia is free\naccess to the resources of the world\n\n\nThe continued dominion of the  dominant powers for\nprolonged periods over the subjugated states that was fueled by their free\naccess to the resources of the enslaved countries has been euphemistically\ncalled various names in honor of the dominant powers at different stages of\nworld history\n\n\nThe Romans called it  Pax Romana  Great Britain\ncalled it  Pax Britannica  Hitler called it   \nLebenstraum   Japan would have called it  Pax\nNipponica  although in fact they opted to call the organization the\nso-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\n\n\nNow because of the undu undisputed military and economic supremacy\nof the U S some American drumbeaters apparently want to call it  Pax\nAmericana  \n\n\nNow Mr President there is nothing wrong intrinsically with getting\naccess to the resources of any country anywhere in the world to promote\nbusiness\n\n\nThere is nothing wrong for the U S to consider business as its main\nbusiness\n\n\nBut for the United States to draw other countries into its embrace\nas a spider lures a fly into its parlor is a cause for legitimate concern for\nthe latter\n\n\nAn extensive discussion of this issue may however carry us too far\na field\n\n\nSuffice it to say at this point that gaining access to the\nresources of the world for the sake of the United States or its  business is not trouble-free\n\n\nIt causes friction especially when the U S has to use muscle to\nease the flow of business through what the C I A calls choke points or places\nwhere shipping may be interdicted by unfriendly forces\n\n\nAccording to the C I A Mr President these include the choke points\ninclude the Bering Strait Panama Canal Luzon Strait and the Singapore Strait\n\n\nWith the Luzon Strait being categorized by the C I A as a possible\nchoke point it stands to reason that the United States will want to ensure\nthat a choking of ship passage will not happen at that point\n\n\nBut since there are no longer any U S military bases here from\nwhich U S forces could pry open any choking of the free passage of vessels at\nthe Luzon Strait the Ramos administration formulated with the Americans the\nso-called Visiting Forces Agreement which in turn the Estrada administration\nhas submitted to the Senate for concurrence\n\n\nWhat does all of this discussion mean\n\n\nMr President it can be the meaning can be capsulized in this phrase\n\n\" preventing the rise of rogue nations \" \n\n\nWhile it is true Mr President that the right of innocent passage of\nships and air ships of friendly nations is guaranteed under international law\nI think the United States out of extreme caution as old man Cicero would say\n\n  ex abundante cautela   wants to plug all\nloopholes\n\n\nThe United States knows that as of today in the year of our Lord\nnineteen hundred ninety-nine nearly every country in this region wants to be\nits friend\n\n\nSome out of lapdog loyalties most others out of pragmatic\nconsiderations\n\n\nYet nobody can foresee what the future will bring\n\n\nA new hegemon or a rogue nation may rise to challenge the\npredominance of the United States and get out of its sphere of influence\n\n\nIn fact China Mr President in the aftermath of the bombing of its\nembassy in Belgrade by NATO planes recently and for historical reasons\nperhaps is already acting up calling the U S a global bully that wants to\nheighten conflicts in many parts of the world instead of resorting to\ndiplomacy to end them\n\n\nI do not think Mr President that the United States wants to be\ncaught off-guard when a rogue nation may want to strike an independent course\nof action for itself in any region or in the world\n\n\nThe United States Mr President would most likely want to prevent\nthat eventuality from ever taking place and what better way to attain that\npurpose than by cementing friendly relations with the military of any country\nwhich as everybody knows is always a force to reckon with especially in\ndeveloping countries like ours\n\n\nI suggest Mr President that the V F A will certainly achieve that\nobjective for the U S\n\n\nUnder the terms of the V F A the United States forces will come\na-visiting not to hobnob with civilian functionaries or even to do a quickie\nwith prostitutes as the silly-minded would want to emphasize as if there will\nbe no prostitution if American soldiers do not visit here\n\n\nNonetheless the American forces will come primarily to exercise\nwith their comrades-at-arms our own soldiers who wearing similar uniforms\nwould take orders in English of course from U S Military Commanders and test\nnew U S arrangements armaments and experiment with new tactics and new\nstraged strategies defined by U S war experts\n\n\nIn furnish fairness Mr President let it be said that the military\nin our country since the administration of the former President Fidel V Ramos\nhas largely kept to the barracks\n\n\nBy that I mean the military did not mount coup attempts against the\nRamos administration that had become rather endemic to the Cory Aquino\nPresidency\n\n\nBut I am not too sure for how long\n\n\nFor even now as we talk the police which used to be an agent of the\nmilitary has been quiescent and restive under the prodding of some\ndisgruntled police officers  1", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "329cfe0d-5754-4889-93a9-ab698bd5b7bd",

added\nmultiple poles of China Japan Western Europe Eastern Europe and developing\nworld states\n\n\nThe paradigm shift from bipolarity to multipolarity has several\nconsequences\n\n\nOne is that the U S and the Soviet Union are now unable to control\ntheir formal allies\n\n\nThe Philippines through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations\nor ASEAN can formulate its own policies and even use collective power to\ninfluence the policies of the U S\n\n\nThe Philippines on occasion could even chart our own policies with\nlittle regard for the decisions of the U S\n\n\nAgainst this backdrop of international change the flow of events is\nno longer predictable\n\n\nAnd it is no longer valid to think of the Philippines vis-a-vis the\nU S in cold war terms or to use the self-conscious vocabulary of vituperation\nto describe the relationship of the two countries\n\n\nThe reordering of international relations is accelerated by the\nemergence of new actors on the international stage\n\n\nThe first generation of actors were states\n\n\nThe second generation of actors today consists of multinational\ncorporations\n\n\nWhen the U S military bases were here multinational corporations or\nM N Cs were viewed as tools of capitalist expansion and exploitation\n\n\nBut today third world states including the Philippines have come to\nregard M N Cs as potential providers of needed investment capital and\ntechnology\n\n\nOther new actors include international governmental organizations\nand non-governmental organizations\n\n\nAs a modest observer of our Senate debates on the V F A I was\nsometimes left with the impression that the arguments back and forth would\nhave been best appreciated in a bipolar world that was based on the old\nEast-West conflict\n\n\nBut the bipolar world has already been consigned to the dustbin of\nhistory\n\n\nWe now realize that in nineteen ninety-one when the Senate voted\nalthough the Berlin wall had fallen the meaning of the end of the cold war\nwas still unknown to the members of the Senate at that time\n\n\nToday based on the historical time line we have begun to realize\nthe meaning of the end of the cold war\n\n\nFor by nineteen ninety-one what had been the single state of\nYugoslavia had become five new states which are now the theater of a bloody\nclash of cultures\n\n\nBy nineteen ninety-two the Soviet Union had disappeared replaced by\nfifteen new states of which eleven joined the so-called Commonwealth of\nIndependent States\n\n\nWith no Soviet Union there is no more cold war\n\n\nAnd without a cold war the Philippines is no longer in danger of\nbeing manipulated into the status of a client state\n\n\nThe Philippines is now a free agent and our  which can only be those that are self-imposed\n\n\nThus the world of the erstwhile Military Bases Agreement is far\ndifferent from our present world of the Visiting Forces Agreement\n\n\nOur world is much more complicated and uncertain\n\n\nThe United States itself is searching for its role in the post cold\nwar world\n\n\nIt is true that the U S remains the world 's unrivalled military\nsuperpower but at the same time the U S has the world 's largest economic\ndebt and suffers from serious domestic problems\n\n\nThe world of the V F A is a changed world\n\n\nWestern Europe is forging a single economic market\n\n\nM N Cs are investing in the former Soviet Union Eastern Europe and\nChina\n\n\nThe flash points of the world continue to breed civil wars national\nliberation conflict and ethnic warfare\n\n\nFundamentalist Islam insists on its own unique world rejecting both\ncommunism and Western solutions to social problems\n\n\nHere in Asia developing world states including the Philippines\nstruggle to recover from the Asian economic crisis\n\n\nWithin this kaleidoscopic universe when we vote on the V F A we do\nso against the background of a contest for leadership of Asia between China\nand Japan fought on the battleground of economic growth\n\n\nOn the one hand Japan is the greatest commercial empire on earth\nand the second most important power in the world\n\n\nIf the U S refuses to maintain substantial forces in the East Asian\nregion Japan will take a larger defense role\n\n\nOn the other hand China looks to become the world 's largest\neconomy by the year twenty twenty\n\n\nA generation from now parts of China will be richer than Europe or\nNorth America today\n\n\nBut because it is too divided it is not likely to achieve\nsuperpower status by twenty twenty\n\n\nIn any event during the next century that starts next year the rest\nof the world will be frightened of China\n\n\nHence a benign U S standing alone can no longer guarantee the\nsecurity of the East Asian region\n\n\nInstead the security of our region will be determined by the\nrelationship between Japan and China\n\n\nDuring this process the Philippine outlook should be shaped not by\ncold war templates but by our experience as a state of the developing world\nalso known as the third world the South or the less developed countries\n\n\nI refer to the Philippine experience of a colonial past sharply\nopposed social and economic classes and economic underdevelopment and poverty\n\n\nWe need to recognize that because of the experience we in the\nPhilippines tend to view the industrialized market economies of the U S as\nboth the cause and the perpetrator of our poverty\n\n\nWe also tend to feel that the current international system\nrelegates us to a permanently inferior position\n\n\nBut this self-knowledge should not remain a bitter element of our\nforeign policy\n\n\nRather self-knowledge should teach us to be a conscious actor in\ninternational politics\n\n\nConcept of National Interest\n\n\nOne of the easiest things to do is to say that voting on the V F A\nshould be determined by national interest\n\n\nBut quote \" national interest \" unquote is a\nconcept that has no universal meaning\n\n\nThe best that Political Science can do is to provide an enumeration\nof the criteria for national interest\n\n\nThese criteria include economics ideology power military security\nand advantage morality and legality cultural affinity or even race and ethnic\nissues\n\n\nThus \" national interest \" could be defined on the\nbasis of either objective or subjective factors\n\n\nObjective factors include economic strength military capability and\nthe size of the resource base\n\n\nSubjective factors include morality legality or ideology\n\n\nWhether the V F A will promote Philippine national interest depends\nupon whether the person defining national interest gives preference to\nobjective or subjective gain\n\n\nHowever it is also widely accepted that there are three basic\nfundamental interests physical survival including territorial integrity\neconomic well-being and national self-determination\n\n\nAt any rate it is an accepted principle of Political Science that\nnational interest is not so much a constant set of national objectives as it\nis a changing approximation of what the leaders of a country view as\nimportant\n\n\nWhen the Senate votes on the V F A we the Senators are actually\ndefining the national interest\n\n\nLike the concept of national interest the concept of national\nsecurity is also undergoing metamorphosis\n\n\nIn the contemporary international system the term quote \" \nnational security \" unquote is no longer commonly defined as\nmilitary defense\n\n\nIt now includes broad-based policies to improve the standards of\nthe population in education health society and the environment\n\n\nIn the post cold war era economic prosperity and welfare concerns\nhave become more important as national goals\n\n\nAccordingly economics is now described as quote the continuation of\npower by other means unquote\n\n\nAdmittedly security dilemmas and territorial disputes persist in\nthe developing parts of the globe such as ours\n\n\nAsia Pacific currently represents a zone of turmoil in contrast to\nthe zone of peace in the developed world\n\n\nNot only the Philippines but also other Asian states most notably\nJapan are apprehensive over the recent arms build-up by China as well as the\nChina claim to the Spratlys\n\n\nSix states including the Philippines claim the Spratlys some sixty\nrocky atolls in the South China Sea because they are believed to contain as\nmuch as one trillion U S dollars in oil and gas deposits\n\n\nAs the Spratly example shows geo-politics as the world has known it\nsince nineteen forty-five is dead\n\n\nThe newly defined battle ground is geo-economics\n\n\nBecause of the rise of regional trading blocks such as APEC or even\nthe proposed AFTA we in the Philippines might find that if our country is not\na member of a team we will not be able to sit at the table\n\n\nIt is possible that the new international economic order a\nreordering of the trilogy of aid trade and foreign investment is now dead\n\n\nThe new imperialists are not necessarily the developed states like\nthe U S or U K but lending organizations like the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund\n\n\nThe Philippines as a Middle Power\n\n\nThe Philippines is categorized as a \" middle power\n\n\" which is defined as a state which cannot afford the large and\nflexible force structures of the major powers but which has attained a\ncredible minimum level of defense self-sufficiency\n\n\nNaturally as a middle power we should seek to enhance our security\n\n\nBut while we seek to strengthen our capacity to defend ourselves\nfrom being drawn into armed conflicts we do not have the financial means to\nincrease our defense self-reliance\n\n\nHence our only available option is to participate in collective or\ncooperative security arrangements with other powers\n\n\nThe Mutual Defense Treaty is a collective security arrangement\nbecause it proposes a collective response to aggression\n\n\nBy contrast the V F A is a cooperative security arrangement because\nit involves bilateral confidence building and capability strengthening\n\n\nOur government pursues this strategy as dictated by the\nconfiguration of the international system and by the level and immediacy of\nperceived danger\n\n\nIt should be accepted that the Philippines is not as far advanced\nin the nation-building process as other states in the region such as\nAustralia and New Zealand\n\n\nThis explains why Philippine national security encompasses both\ndomestic stability and international security\n\n\nWhile our national security has come to be synonymous with economic\nsecurity our country is also concerned about secessionism and the\ndisintegrating effects of ethnic religious or class tension\n\n\nAccordingly we should not overlook the problem of internal\nstability\n\n\nThe need to maintain domestic security in our country is a powerful\nfactor in the foreign and defense policy calculations of the Estrada\nadministration\n\n\nDuring the present situation the Philippines as a middle power is\ncompelled to adopt the common strategy followed all over the world for\nreducing our vulnerabilities\n\n\nThis strategy is to augment our military power not just by building\nup our own capabilities but by enlisting the aid of a major power\n\n\nWhich major power should be our formal ally\n\n\nFollowing the advice of Thucydides after his study of the\nPeloponnesian war we should look for an ally with whom we share a common\nthreat\n\n\nAccording to Thucydides mutual fear is the most solid basis upon\nwhich to organize an alliance\n\n\nOur present ally is the U S\n\n\nAre there compelling arguments for discarding this ally\n\n\nI have heard none that would be logical in a post cold war world\n\n\nThe R P - U S Mutual Defense Treaty is already in place\n\n\nIt provides for the  cases  federis   \nmeaning the situation in which mutual commitments are to become operational\n\n\nThe  cases  federis   is set out in\nArticle four quote  Each party recognizes that an armed attack in the\nPacific area on either of the parties would be dangerous to its own peace and\nsafety and declares that it would act to meet the common dangers in\naccordance with its Constitutional processes  unquote\n\n\nThus the  cases  federis   is very\nprecise\n\n\nThere has to be an armed attack\n\n\nBy contrast the ensuing commitment is vague\n\n\nThe U S will act in accordance with its Constitution\n\n\nSome quarters think this commitment is too vague and would prefer\nwhat is called a hair trigger clause meaning an automatic commitment to\nmilitary action  1", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e73f715d-fa68-4c82-b623-ee1edebfc835", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nYour Eminence Alfonso Cardinal Lopez Trujillo papal legate for\nthe Fourth World Meeting of Families Your Eminence Jaime Cardinal Sin\nArchbishop of Manila Your Eminences members of the College of Cardinals Your\nExcellency Archbishop Antonio Franco our apostolic nuncio Your Excellencies\nthe Most Reverend Archbishops and Bishops Reverend Sisters and Brothers the\ndelegations from the various countries of the world and the forty-two babies\nofficially registered in this World Meeting of Families my brothers and\nsisters in the Lord good morning  \n\n\nWhen our Holy Father, announced that the World Meeting of\nFamilies will be held in the Philippines the Bishops Conference of the\nPhilippines said it is very difficult so we passed on the job to Archbishop\nto the Archbishop of Manila Cardinal Sin who performs miracles\n\n\nWe begin the Fourth World Meeting of Families with the celebration\nof the Holy Eucharist the sacrament of love that Jesus left for us his family\nof faith the household of God the family of God\n\n\nHow profoundly meaningful and immeasurably without price is God 's\ngift of the Eucharist for us and for every family\n\n\nLet us reflect briefly on the Eucharist and the family\n\n\nThe Eucharist tells us what kind of love God has for us and how we\nin turn must love one another\n\n\nThe cross of Jesus and the Holy Eucharist are the ultimate symbols\nof authentic love\n\n\nFor on the cross Jesus himself fulfills the word he had declared to\nhis disciples there is no greater love than this for one to lay down his life\nfor a friend\n\n\nHis body broken on the cross his blood being poured out as an\noffering to God his Father for the sake of all Jesus demonstrates the nature\nand extent of his love completely unconditional utterly sacrificial totally\nself-giving\n\n\nIt is from the cross my brothers and sisters that a new people of\nGod a new family of faith was born\n\n\nBorn in the pangs of the passion and death of Jesus born in God 's\nincomparable love the promise in Jeremiah the prophet that we read this\nmorning of a new covenant and a new law written in the hearts of God of God 's\npeople is fulfilled\n\n\nAt the Last Supper Jesus gives a new commandment love one another\nas I have loved you so you also should love one another\n\n\nOur second liturgical reading from the first letter of John adds if\nwe love one another God remains in us\n\n\nThe blood that Jesus shared with his apostles at the Last Supper is\nthe seal of a new and everlasting covenant\n\n\nEvery time then that we celebrate the Eucharist we also celebrate\nthe new covenant and our birthday as God 's people God 's own family\n\n\nAnd if the commandment of love is at the heart of the new family of\nGod we did not wonder that the  at the rite of Holy Matrimony with\nwhich a new family a new human family begins the new husband is reminded of\nthe words of Jesus and later the words of Saint Paul to love his wife as\nChrist loves his church\n\n\nToday 's gospel reading is the beautiful story of the boy Jesus in\nthe temple\n\n\nIt tells us what it is to be a family of love\n\n\nIn the story Mary and Joseph bring their son of twelve years old on\nthe regular pilgrimage to Jerusalem on the feast of the Passover the same\nfeast that Jesus would  later transform into the new Passover\nof the family of God the mystery of his passion death and resurrection the\ncross and the Eucharist\n\n\nAnd in Jerusalem Mary and Joseph  leave  Jesus to follow\ndevotedly and faithfully the religious traditions of Israel traditions that\nthey had taught him at home traditions of believing of praying and of\nworshiping\n\n\nAt the end of the celebration Mary and Joseph discover that Jesus\nis not with them they search for him with great concern and anxiety but with\nthe intuition of parents who know the hopes and dreams of their son\n\n\nThey go back to the temple and there they see the young son\nastounding the teachers of the law with his intelligent answers and questions\n\n\nTo the concern of his beloved mother Jesus lovingly and\nrespectfully responds why were you looking for me\n\n\nDid you not know that I must be in my Father 's house\n\n\nDid you not know that I must be about my Father 's work\n\n\nIn his heart Jesus hears the call of God to go beyond his home\nbeyond his village in Nazareth but now he must yet return home with his\nparents Mary and Joseph\n\n\nSaint Luke sums up the life of Jesus with Mary and Joseph very\nsimply Jesus was obedient to them obedient to their teachings  \n\n\nThe love and life of Jesus revolved most obviously around Mary and\nJoseph but most of all his love and life was centered on God\n\n\nIt was also true for Mary and Joseph\n\n\nLife in the Holy Family is a lesson for every family\n\n\nIn every family life must be a life of love shared generously to\noverflowing love that is finally expressed in service\n\n\nLife in the family must be centered on God\n\n\nThis is the secret of advancing in wisdom and grace before God and\nman and this too is the key to confronting the many challenges families of\nthe world face today\n\n\nFrom the very beginning then my brothers and sisters the family as\nfounded on the totally self-sacrificing love of God is fundamental good news\nfor the third millennium\n\n\nBut today you and I know that the family is facing the grave\nchallenge of a materialistic and secularist culture that is bringing bringing\nin a new morality with no religious foundation\n\n\nAnd this emerging global culture attacks fundamental scriptural and\necclesial teachings and the very nature of life nature of death love and\nmarriage men women and children\n\n\nIt is a challenge that the world has never known before because\nespecially because it is so quickly disseminated through the tools of social\ncommunication\n\n\nIn the multicultural and multireligious Asian environment where the\nChurch is a tiny minority of less than two percent and in a democratic social\norder such as the Philippines sometimes the Church seems to be but one feeble\nprophetic voice against many contrary voices even more strident and sometimes\nbetter heard than that of the Church\n\n\nWe hope therefore that the Fourth World Meeting of Families will\ninspire encourage and strengthen the Filipino family and the Asian family\n\n\nWe in the Philippines we are a poor country but rich indeed in\nreligious faith but sadly however we sometimes tend to separate faith from\nlife\n\n\nAnd that is why at the beginning of the third millennium in January\ntwo thousand one the Church in the Philippines has deliberately chosen the\nFilipino Catholic family as the focal point of evangelization\n\n\nConcretely this pastoral thrust of the Church in the Philippines\nmeans that all diocesan and parochial pastoral programs of evangelization\nwill be directed toward the renewal of the family\n\n\nIn this way the Filipino Catholic family as the domestic Church\nwill become an evangelized and evangelizing cell of basic ecclesial\ncommunities of covenant communities village chapels and parishes all over the\nPhilippines\n\n\nAt this point then my brothers and sisters may I express some hopes\nnot only for Filipino Catholic families but also for all the families of our\nworld\n\n\nHope with me\n\n\nWe hope that the Fourth World Meeting of Families will deepen\nstrengthen and quicken the faith of every family help transform every family\ninto a faith that into a family of faith that loves shares and serves a faith\nthat does justice\n\n\nWe hope that every family would be a true sanctuary of love and\nlife ever alert and committed to defending and promoting human life in that\nseamless continuum that God created it to have from the very beginning\n\n\nWe hope that all families would be totally imbued with the values\nof the Gospel and of the Kingdom of God so as to be a powerful Gospel leaven\nin society\n\n\nWe hope that every Catholic family would be a school of faith of\nlove and prayer guiding the hearts of parents and their children to holiness\nin the kingdom of God and to participation in the whole mission of the Church\n\n\nWe hope that every Catholic family would be a fertile seed bed of\nvocation not only to a socially transformational lay state but also to the\npriestly and religious life while renewed in its sense of mission to its\nmilieu even extending its missionary concern   ad jentes ad\ndextero   and   ad vitam   \n\n\nAnd finally we pray that the Fourth World Meeting of Families would\nassist the Church in the Philippines to realize these hopes\n\n\nIt is in this light my brothers and sisters that we Filipinos are\ntruly honored and privileged to be the first Asian host of the Firth Fourth\nWorld Meeting of Families\n\n\nWe are deeply thankful to our Holy Father Pope John Paul the Second\nand to his personal special legate His Eminence Alfonso Cardinal Lopez\nTrujillo and to them both  Mabuhay  \n\n\nOur country is one that is wonderfully devoted to our Blessed\nMother Mary whom we invoke in the litany as the Queen of the Family and we\nbeg today our Mother and Queen to be with us to intercede for us and keep us\nunited with her Son\n\n\nMy brothers and sisters in the one family of God the world over\nwith the joy and peace of our Lord Jesus and in behalf of the more than one\nhundred bishops of the Philippines  and into the\none  heart of the Filipino family   Mabuhay", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\n I propose to cluster the rights enumerated in  \nFamiliaris Consortio  under these headings first the right to a\nfamily 's integrity and be respected in its freedoms second the right of the\nfamily to receive its share of socio-economic benefits and third the right of\nthe family to pass on its faith and its values to the next generation\n\n\nFamily Integrity\n\n\nThe rights of a family are directed principally at its integrity\n\n\nThe importance of the integrity of a family is emphasized in the\nCatechism for Filipino Catholics which teaches as follows open quote  \nActually our Christian families like the Church itself in some real way share\nin the communion of persons and love of the Blessed Trinity\n\n\n For in the mutual sharing of thoughts affections and in all\ntheir ups and downs Christian families are actively creative like the Father\n\n\nIn offering prayers and sacrifices to God they share in Jesus the\nIncarnate Son 's own prayer and redemptive sacrifice\n\n\nFinally Christian families form a community of interpersonal love\nby being inspired and strengthened by the indwelling Holy Spirit\n\n\nHardly anything nobler can be said of the Catholic family than that\nin a privileged manner it not only resembles but shares in the communion of\nthe Triune God   \n\n\nBut a multitude of factors and circumstances threaten to destroy the\nintegrity of the family\n\n\nOne example is a slavish attachment to communication media\n\n\nChildren today rush home from school not to the loving embrace of\ntheir parents who may still be at work anyway but to some cartoon show\n\n\nI tremble at the thought that children will soon know T V\ncharacters better than their parents  \n\n\nIndeed  \n\n\nAnd then there is the Internet where a wealth of knowledge useful\nto any family is sabotaged by silent threats\n\n\nThere are child molesters who choose their targets through the\nInternet\n\n\nThere is also the threat of child pornography hate websites that\nencourage the use of violence against certain groups of people and other\nmaterials that contradict what the Pope calls wholesome recreation that\nfosters family values\n\n\nWe also note that a growing number of Filipinos and of citizens of\nunderdeveloped countries go to other countries to find work\n\n\nThe intention of course is noble to provide for their families\nbetter through more lucrative employment than can be offered by their\neconomically beleaguered countries\n\n\nThe costs however are indisputably high\n\n\nSometimes the spouses of overseas workers or the workers themselves\nabandon their marital vows perhaps out of loneliness\n\n\nEven when spouses remain true to each other their children may\nbecome distant as they grow up without the attention of either or both\nparents\n\n\nIn all these cases there is a violation of what the Holy Father\ncalls the right to the intimacy of conjugal and family life and the right to\nthe stability of the bond of marriage\n\n\nAnd such violation arises from the breach of another of the family 's\nright that is to have adequate means to support a family\n\n\nThere is also the unspeakable evil of sexual crimes occurring\nwithin the family\n\n\nRape is evil in itself but incestuous rape is even more\ndehumanizing\n\n\nSexual crimes in the family are alarmingly becoming common\n\n\nWe can attribute this trend to evil influences in the mass media or\nto the breaking of families for economic or emotional reasons\n\n\nRegardless of the reason however these crimes are a great injustice\nto all families and they must be stopped\n\n\nWe must however shun the error of seeing the state as the principal\nthreat to the family\n\n\nWhile it is regrettable that the policies of some states have not\nalways been helpful to the family the fact remains that some of the most\nserious transgri transgressions of the rights of the family are perpetrated\nby members of the family themselves\n\n\nAs the family struggles for justice it must then struggle with its\nmembers so they become in the first instance champions of and not obstacles\nto justice for the family\n\n\nThe state does its part in the family 's struggle for integrity its\nstruggle for justice\n\n\nI am proud that the Constitution of the Philippines is one of few\nbasic legal documents with express provision on the family\n\n\nSection twelve of Article two thereof or the Declaration of\nPrinciples and State Policies solemnly announces this State policy open quote\n\n The State recognizes the sanctity of family life and shall protect\nand strengthen the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from\nconception\n\n\n The natural and primary right and duty of parents in the\nrearing of the youth for civic efficiency and the development of character\nshall receive the support of the Government  close quote  \n\n\nIt also devotes for the family one separate article\n\n\nThis is Article fifteen\n\n\nI have yet to see another Constitution from among civilized nations\nwhich enshrines a separate article on the family\n\n\nIn many respects Section twelve of Article two of our Constitution\nis consonant with fundamental Catholic teachings on the family\n\n\nIt is a fundamental norm in construing the provisions of a\nConstitution that every term is accorded significance and that the\nConstitution uses \" sanctity \" I stress \" sanctity\n\n\" is both philosophically and legally significant then\n\n\nIt suggests an order higher than the merely legal to which the\nfamily must be referred\n\n\nIt enshrines the principle of subsidiarity because the family is\nguaranteed protection as an open quote autonomous social institution close\nquote with the result that matters within the purveyance of the family shall\nnot be arrogated by the state itself\n\n\nEvery Filipino family should be particularly proud of the fact that\nthe Constitution goes so far in protecting the integrity of the human family\nand in upholding the sanctity of human life\n\n\nThe natural and primary right and duty of parents to rear the youth\nimposes on the State an obligation to distribute the benefits and resources\nof the nation to enable the parents to exercise this primary right and duty\n\n\nThen we have Section one of Article fifteen which provides as\nfollows  The State recognizes the Filipino family as the foundation of\nthe nation  close quote\n\n\nAccordingly it shall strengthen its solidi solidarity and actively\npromote its total development\n\n\nSection three thereof enumerates these rights of the Filipino\nfamily  one the right of spouses to found a family in accordance with\nthe religious convictions and the demands of responsible parenthood two the\nright of children to assistance including proper care and nutrition and\nspecial protection from all forms of neglect abuse cruelty exploitation and\nother conditions prejudicial to their development three the right of the\nfamily to a family living wage and income and four the right of families or\nfamily associations to participate in the planning and implementation of\npolicies and programs that affect them  \n\n\nI will now take up socio-economic benefits\n\n\nThe discussions I just made on the rights of the family and the\nduty of the state to protect and enhance these rights illustrate the demands\nof distributive justice that the family must receive its share of the\nbenefits and the protection as well as the guarantee of the freedoms it can\nrightly claim\n\n\nThe Church has very often been chided for being blissfully ignorant\nof the travails of many a present-day family of being naive about the social\nand economic forces that strain its resiliency\n\n\nVery often these criticisms come in the wake of the Church\ninsistence on its moral teaching especially on the regulation of births and\ncontraceptive practices\n\n\nWhile in a democracy the beliefs of all and the rights of all to\nact as they believe provided these do not contravene the rights of others\nwill for all time be upheld it is my position both as a minister of the law\nand a son of the Church that Holy Mother Church serves humanity best when she\nfaithfully and unhesatingly  \nteaches as She should teach  opportune et importune  in\nseason and out of season  \n\n\nThe Church knows the travails of families\n\n\nIn  Gaudium et Spes  the Second Vatican Council\nobserves open quote  the economic social psychological social and\ncivil climate of today has a severely disturbing effect on family life\n\n\n There are also the serious and aram alarming problems arising\nin many parts of the world as a result of population expansion\n\n\nOn all of these counts an anguish of conscience is being generated\nan anguish of conscience is being generated  close quote  \n\n\nConsequently the same Council summarizes the obligations of the\nState in this regard and the demands of justice towards the family\n\n\nI quote  Civil authority should consider it a sacred duty to\nacknowledge the true nature of marriage and the family to protect and foster\nthem to safeguard public morality and promote domestic prosperity\n\n\n The rights of parents to procreate and educate children in the\nfamily must be safeguarded\n\n\nThere should also be welfare legislation and provision of various\nkinds for the made for the protection and assistance of those who\nunfortunately have been deprived of the benefits of family life   \n\n\nHence the Philippines has definitely gone a long way in providing\nsocio-economic benefits to the family\n\n\nThere are as well non-governmental organizations which unceasingly\nwork for the welfare of the family\n\n\nNeedless to say the failure of the State to comply with its\nobligations to the family or to promote and enhance its rights and provide it\nsocio-economic benefits justly due it would be an act of injustice to the\nfamily\n\n\nFaith and Values\n\n\nThe Second Plenary Council of the Philippines identifies the\nChristian family as a open quote a worker of renewal close quote\n\n\nIt teaches and I quote  The family is meant by God to be the\nfirst school of discipleship where the parents are the first catechists of\ntheir children and where all the members mutually evangelize each other\n\n\n It is also the first school of evangelization where the members\nlearn to share with others the grace and light of Christ  close quote\n\n \n\n\nArticle one of the Family Code of the Philippines makes it clear\nthat the provisions of the Family Code as well as of other laws on the family\nare designed principally to safeguard marriage as open quote the foundation\nof the family and an inviolable social institution close quote\n\n\nArticle one hundred forty-nine of the same Code describes the\nfamily as open quote a basic social institution which public policy cherishes\nand protects close quote\n\n\nThe legal consequence of this esteem is also made clear open quote\n\n Family relations are governed by law and no custom practice or\nagreement destructive of the family shall be recognized or given effect\n\n close quote\n\n\nThis then is the underlying ethos of Philippine family law\nprotecting the family through the institutions of law and the mechanisms of\nthe justice system\n\n\nWhile the Philippines like other democracies believes in the\nseparation of Church and State our political legal and jurisprudential\ntradition have never read this constitutional principle of separation as\nestablishing a secularist an atheistic or an agnostic state\n\n\nWhen Article twen two hundred twenty of our Family Code recites the\nrights and duties of parents toward their children it is almost as if one\nwere reading from a classic treatise of moral theology\n\n\nThese rights and duties under the Family Code are as follows\n\n one to keep them in their company to support educate and instruct\nthem by right precept and good example and to provide for their upbringing in\nkeeping with their means two to give them love and affection advice and\ncounsel companionship and understanding three to provide them with moral and\nspiritual guidance inculcate in them honesty integrity self-discipline\nself-reliance industry and thrift stimulate their interest in civil affairs\nand inspire them in compliance with the duties of citizenship  \n\n\nThus does the State manifest that it is its concern that children\nreceive moral and spiritual guidance from their parents\n\n\nClearly we in the Philippines must struggle as all of you must in\nyour own countries  to our visitors with the\ndelicate balance between a healthy pluralism and the consecration to values\nand virtues that foster the flourishing of the human heart and spirit\n\n\nIt will remain a state responsibility to shield the youth from\npernicious influences\n\n\nThis is why we have harsh laws penalizing the peddling and use of\ndangerous drugs and substances\n\n\nThis also explains why the exploitation of children in different\nforms is a crime in this jurisdiction even when or especially when\nperpetrated by the children 's parents\n\n\nIn keeping with the treaty obligations of the Republic of the\nPhilippines under the Convention of the Rights of the Child the Legislature\nenacted Republic Act seventy-six ten and amendatory laws that protect the\nchild from all forms of exploitation and abuse and that endeavor to keep the\nchild within the protective embrace of the family but likewise  \namply providing for those unfortunate situations where children are victims\nof dysfunctional families\n\n\nExercising its rule-making power vested in it by the Constitution\nthe Supreme Court of the Philippines has promulgated special rules to protect\nthe child The Rule for the Examination of the Child Witness the Rule for\nJuveniles in conflict with the Law and the Rule for the Commitment of\nChildren\n\n\nWhile awaiting the organization of family courts already created by\nlaw and recognizing that family and domestic problems cannot and should not\nbe dealt with in the same way as ordinary matters of litigation the Supreme\nCourt has designated many courts throughout the country to sit as family\ncourts\n\n\nI can assure you that the Philippines Supreme Court has been and\nwill always be on the side of the family in its struggle for justice  \n\n\nI cannot help but voice the concern that many families have\nabdicated the privilege of passing on cherished values to the next generation\n\n\nLaws alone will not guarantee that our children and their children\nwill live their lives by the values that have guided and molded their\nforebears\n\n\nThe family 's struggle for justice will also take then the form of\na struggle for its members to be what God and human society call them to be\nbearers of the values of future generations\n\n\nForemost of these values is  pakikipagkapwa tao  \nwhich is definitely more than just amiability or affability\n\n\nIt is true concern empathy and charity for others\n\n\nIt is being a neighbor to others as the Gospel uses the descriptive\n\n\" neighbor \" stress \" neighbor \" especially\nto the poor and the weak\n\n\nIt is in the family where the concept of human rights must first\nmake sense and this means that every member must deal with the other with a\nsincere regard and genuine respect for elemental human rights\n\n\nIt is the family that must teach the young the precious lesson that\nthe greatest privilege one can ever enjoy is that of standing from the table\nshedding off one 's finery and stooping to wash the feet of one 's brothers\nand sisters\n\n\nThis is love beyond measure\n\n\nWhen the family is thus faithful to its calling true to its\nvocation it becomes the frontier for the world 's struggle for justice and\nits members the agents and the prophets of the often unarticulated cry for\njustice\n\n\nThe greatest tribute that can be given to such a family is for all\nto be able to say of it  See how they love one another  \n\n\nAfter all it was thus that the Master the Christ wished his\ndisciples to be known\n\n\nThus every family must grow on the foundations of love and be\nnourished by love", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nMr President distinguished colleagues of the Senate I vote for\nconcurrence and may I explain my vote\n\n\nMr President in this chamber I was among the first if not indeed the\nvery first to announce support for the R P - U S Visiting Forces Agreement\n\n\nThis is a matter of record\n\n\nAnd it was long before I had been asked to co-sponsor this\nresolution of concurrence\n\n\nI have not always been an advocate Mr President\n\n\nReading the text for the first time and reading it as a stand-alone\ndocument without reference to anything else I felt the Agreement would be\neasier to attack than to defend\n\n\nAnd the opposition tried to prove it\n\n\nOne had to read the Visiting Forces Agreement within the context of\nour R P - U S Mutual Defense Treaty and the vast net of security treaties\nbetween the United States and its allies including seventy-seven Status of\nForces Agreements in order to see its real meaning purpose and usefulness\n\n\nThat did not require revealed knowledge only a less disinterested\nview of our security and the larger security environment of the Asia Pacific\n\n\nSince then I have had the opportunity of reaffirming my support for\nthe Agreement and sharing some of the insults and abuse heaped upon its\nsupporters by its most rabid opponents\n\n\nMr President distinguished colleagues as we concur in this\nAgreement I wish to make of record my sincere appreciation and thanks to the\nchairs of the Committees on Foreign Relations and National Defense and\nSecurity for asking me to share the burden of moving this measure on the\nfloor\n\n\nThe honor was unexpected unsought and undeserved\n\n\nBut I was more than pleased to accept the challenge\n\n\nI hope I have not been unhelpful in trying to make our people see\nwhy we need the V F A as much as the United States and the Asia Pacific\nregion need it why it will do us more good than harm and why concurrence is\nthe right thing to do for this Senate\n\n\nBut I have said enough and our people have heard enough from me on\nthis subject\n\n\nI will not tax their patience or their good will by repeating what\nI said earlier in the debates or by adding another ten thousand words\n\n\nWe need sixteen votes to concur in this Agreement\n\n\nThat number has just been reached\n\n\nThe vote I cast is the seventeenth vote in favor of this Agreement\n\n\nAll that is needed now is for the chair after the next speaker to\ngavel the end of the voting and to declare that the Senate has concurred in\nthe Agreement and our government can then inform the United States government\nthat it has completed the Constitutional process required for the Visiting\nForces Agreement to come into force and effect\n\n\nMr President vanity may tempt us to call this a resounding victory\nfor our side or cause\n\n\nThat would be exceedingly self-congratulatory self-indulgent and\nover-simplistic and I would not walk into it\n\n\nFor me this is a victory for the entire Senate and for the entire\ncountry regardless of what position everyone took during the debate\n\n\nIt is a victory for the democratic process\n\n\nSpecifically it is a victory for the joint committees for steering\nthe measure patiently on the floor after months of study public hearings and\ncommittee debates\n\n\nIt 's a victory for the majority of the Senate for standing by the\nAgreement despite all types of pressure including warnings of death and\ndamnation from the most unlikely sources\n\n\nIt 's a victory for the majority of our people for expressing\nthemselves clearly and soberly through countless resolutions in support of\nthe Agreement\n\n\nIt 's a victory for the opposition in the Senate for examining\nevery provision phrase and particle of the Agreement for any possible\nimperfection blemish or defect\n\n\nDespite their lack of numbers they used every parliamentary and\nlegal device in a brave if unsuccessful effort to stop the clock sway the\nSenate thwart concurrence\n\n\nThey lost in that bid but they won our admiration for giving it\ntheir best shot up to the very end\n\n\nAnd it is a victory for the motley opposition in the street for\nwaging a spirited campaign despite the odds\n\n\nSome of their more exuberant numbers managed to interrupt our\nproceedings and managed to explode a few pill boxes or fire crackers\n\n\nSome of them resorted to the return of political graffiti on the\nstreets but all that has added vibrance and vigor to the debate\n\n\nAnd we are none the worse for it\n\n\nOur only regret my only regret Mr President is that while we sought\nsupport for the V F A for reasons of national security and external defense\nwe saw some of our dearest friends trying to mobilize the Church or being\nmobilized by some people in the name of the Church against the Agreement for\nreasons that had nothing to do at all with the ministry or practice of their\nfaith which unhappily happens to be ours as well\n\n\nEven as we vote this political mobilization is going on outside in\na last-minute effort to sway the Senate to reject the Agreement\n\n\nThese are brothers and sisters of ours in the faith for whom we\nhave nothing but love and respect\n\n\nWith them I have been pleased to be associated on many great moral\nissues\n\n\nWith them I have prayed fasted and marched for some great cause\n\n\nWith them I would march to the very ends of the earth for any of\nthe great moral and religious issues and causes that bind us in one communion\nand one Church\n\n\nBut this time we stand unhappily on opposite sides\n\n\nWe driven by principle public duty and conscience and they invoking\na special if not exclusive use of a faith that is common to most of us on\nboth sides of the debate\n\n\nFor reasons of  prudence Mr President I have tried not\nto talk about this at all during the debates\n\n\nBut a couple of days ago I received on the telephone an unexpected\nand most unusual request\n\n\nIt was a stranger who called friendly and respectful yes but a\nstranger nevertheless and with a deep anguish in her voice she said  \nKit huwag mong pabayaan ang ating simbahan huwag mo siyang tatalikdan ikaw\nang aming pag-asa at inaasahan sa Senado\n\n\nMas mahalaga ba sa 'yo si Erap at ang V F A kaysa ating Cardinal at\nmga kapatid mong Katoliko  \n\n\nIt is one of the saddest and most difficult conversations I 've\never had in my entire life and I didn't quite know what to say\n\n\nI tried to explain that my Catholic faith which is more important\nto me than my public office or anything else in my life had absolutely\nnothing to do with my position on the Visiting Forces Agreement or on any\nother non-moral non-ethical and non-religious issue which I have had to deal\nwith\n\n\nAnd that I was supporting the Visiting Forces Agreement only\naccording to my best lights as God has given me the light to see what is best\nfor our country and people in the area of national security and external\ndefense\n\n\nNeither was my position a result of my having made a choice between\nmy support for President Joseph Ejercito Estrada and my loyalty to my Bishop\nHis Eminence Jaime Cardinal Sin\n\n\nThat is a completely absurd and unexistent choice\n\n\nOne has nothing to do with the other\n\n\nOne does not cancel the other out\n\n\nThe V F A as I have just said is not a moral ethical or religious\nmatter\n\n\nAnd my desire to help President Estrada succeed despite my being a\nmember of a different political party and despite my previous criticisms of\nhim before he became President does not in any way alter or diminish my love\nrespect and best wishes for the good health and good humor of His Eminence\nthe Cardinal Archbishop of Manila whose loyal parishioner I am\n\n\nIn all my public life Mr President I have always kept a strict\ndistinction between my personal and professional interests and those of the\nnation\n\n\nI have never confused one with the other and I have never put my\ninterests above those of the nation\n\n\nIn the case of the Visiting Forces Agreement I have no personal\ninterests at all\n\n\nIt is all for the nation which deserves a future infinitely better\nand brighter than what would otherwise be possible where we to leave it\nsolely in the hands of those who would have us standing naked in the wind\nwithout anything at all to protect us against the storm\n\n\nAs a Roman Catholic I have always known the distinction between the\nclergy and religious on the one hand and the laity on the other between\nChurch authority and personal freedom\n\n\nAgain I have never confused one with the other\n\n\nI have some close personal associations and friendships with many\npriests and bishops of long standing but I have always behaved as a layman\naware of the rights and duties of a layman and with no ambitions of ever\nbecoming a cleric or of ever behaving like one\n\n\nI go to a priest as often as I can for my sins but never for\ncounsel on anything political for I do not believe it is right or just or\neven in good taste or good form for an elected official or anyone at all to\nask a priest whether or not he should run for this office or that vote for\nthis candidate or that to support or oppose this treaty resolution or bill\n\n\nAll this I tried to explain to our good sister on the telephone\n\n\nBut nothing I said seemed to make an impression\n\n\nOur conversation had become a dialogue of the deaf\n\n\nTo everything I said she answered with something that sounded like\na Buddhist chant  Makisama ka Makiisa ka  \n\n\nShe seemed more determined than the Duke of Norfolk trying to\ncompel Thomas More in Robert Bolt 's play A Man for All Seasons to give his\nassent to the King 's marriage since all the other great men of England had\nalready given theirs\n\n\nDo we remember that scene\n\n\nSays Norfolk  But dammit Thomas look at those names\n\n\n You know those men\n\n\nCan't you do what I did and come with us for fellowship  \n\n \n\n\nAnd Thomas answers  And when we stand before God and you\nascend to paradise for doing according to your conscience and I 'm damned for\nnot doing according to mine will you come with me for fellowship  \n\n\nLike everyone else in this chamber Mr President I am a citizen in\nthe service of the state\n\n\nBut I am first and above all a man\n\n\nA man who for all his sins tries to practice his faith and serve\nhis Church as best he can as I aspire not so much to have a good name in\nhistory as to have a place in eternity face to face with our God\n\n\nI would not for anything in the world put my politics above my\nfaith\n\n\nI would not use my faith in the service of my politics\n\n\nFor I know that while I belong to my faith and to my Church my\nfaith and my Church do not belong to me as material possessions to be used\nfor any reason whatsoever\n\n\nAnd I would be pained as I am pained now to see any brother or\nsister of mine in the faith use that same faith or the Church or for any\npersonal or political purpose and in such facile manner\n\n\nIn my own small way Mr President I have fought every attempt on the\npart of the state for state authorities to propose their own religion or\ntheir own morality in order to encroach into the rights of the Church \n In\nthe past, in the past this went by the name of  Caesaro Popism\n\n a word that combines the words \" Caesar \" and\n\n\" Pope \" to designate a phenomenon or a time when the\nemperor also tried to act as Pope\n\n\nIt will continue to be known as such until we give it a new name\n\n\nIn my own small way I have denounced this evil wherever I 've seen\nit and I 'll continue to do so for as long as I live\n\n\nBut I do not believe I can in good conscience oppose and denounce\nthe slightest hint of  Caesaro Popism  wherever and\nwhenever it appears while accepting by default the opposite disorder arising\nfrom a sad and mistaken desire on the part of some of our dearest friends to\npronounce a Church position on a morally neutral ethically neutral and\nreligiously neutral document\n\n\nThe Visiting Forces Agreement is a technical document\n\n\nIt seeks to provide a legal mechanism to facilitate the visit of U\nS forces for purposes and activities previously approved by the Philippine\ngovernment in the spirit of the nineteen fifty-one Mutual Defense Treaty\nbetween our two countries  1", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3956e340-2187-4478-b9a1-f89b73579019", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.296608+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\nThe topic that was assigned to me to reflect upon is \" \nThe Christian Family and the Paschal Mystery \" \n\n\nWow a heavy topic and the official program of the Congress adds a\nsubtitle to the topic and I think it is equally important because it\nindicates how we should address the topic\n\n\nAnd the subtitle is \" Dialogue and the Spirituality of the\nCross \" \n\n\nSo we shall reflect on the Christian family as a community formed in\ndialogue and how the Paschal mystery is the driving spiritual force of any\ngenuine dialogue\n\n\nSo my reflection will consist of three parts\n\n\nThe first part addresses the question what is the Paschal mystery\nand what is dialogue\n\n\nThen I move to the second part the Paschal mystery as dialogue par\nexcellence\n\n\nAnd the final portion is a reflection on the family and the\nspirituality of the Paschal mystery\n\n\nSo the first part what is the Paschal mystery what is dialogue\n\n\nIn the second letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians he says that\nevery Christian or disciple of Jesus must carry in his or her body the death\nof Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested\n\n\nA Christian therefore is one who bears in his or her person and\nlife the mark of the Paschal mystery the mark of Jesus 's death and rising to\nnew life\n\n\nAnd let us be reminded it is not a physical mark like the color of\nthe hair or like the mole that I have here on my chin\n\n\nIt is a spiritual mark it is a spiritual principle that defines a\nwhole way of being human and of living in the world\n\n\nAnd if it is true that the Christian lives by the power of the\nPaschal mystery I think we can say also that it applies to every community\nthat claims and wants to be Christian including the family\n\n\nA Christian family must live by the mark and the power of the\nPaschal mystery of Jesus\n\n\nBut then we ask what precisely is the Paschal mystery\n\n\nNow many theologians pastors and spiritual writers through the ages\nhave given us valuable insights into the Paschal mystery but for our purposes\nI would like to present the Paschal mystery as God 's desire coming from pure\nlove to gift the world with fullness of life\n\n\nLet me repeat, the Paschal mystery as God 's desire coming from\npure love to gift the world with fullness of life\n\n\nAnd this gift of life is offered through the crucified Jesus who is\nraised back to life\n\n\nLife freely and lovingly given in death brings forth new and\nabundant life for the world\n\n\nI repeat, life freely and lovingly given in death brings forth\nnew and abundant life for the world\n\n\nAnd if we notice the Paschal mystery described the way I just\ndescribed it follows the very movement of love an offering of life so that\nothers may have life\n\n\nI don't know what you think but I think this is an acceptable\nunderstanding of the Paschal mystery\n\n\nWhat do you think\n\n\n Pwede na ba\n\n\nAhh pwede na   \n\n\nOkay so we shall use this particular though limited understanding\nto reflect on dialogue within the Christian family\n\n\nSo now let us inquire about dialogue\n\n\nNow again so many philosophers psychologists and spiritual guides\nhave explored the reality of dialogue\n\n\nBut for this Conference my working description of \" \ndialogue \" is a mutuality of interiority\n\n\nIt is an exchange of what is most intimate between two or more\npersons\n\n\nSo dialogue happens when the gift of self freely shared is freely\nreceived and results in an equal gifting of self\n\n\nSo if you notice again the movement of dialogue is the same\nmovement of love\n\n\nSo I will try to demonstrate now how in the Paschal mystery the\nso-called drama of Jesus 's cross and resurrection we find a supreme form of\ndialogue in the supreme manifestation of love\n\n\nI move now to my second part the Paschal mystery as dialogue par\nexcellence and here I invite everyone to meditate\n\n\nI will dwell on three aspects of the Paschal mystery interpreted\nfrom the perspective of dialogue\n\n\nFirst of all the Paschal mystery is about Jesus 's eternal love\ntowards the Father a love that enables him to engage in a dialogue with the\nFather characterized by availability a dialogue of availability\n\n\nThe Father has a dream for the world\n\n\nIt is the dream of a lover it is a plan to bring life and love to\nevery creature so that all may be united to God and to each other\n\n\nLet us imagine the divine dream as love flowing from the very heart\nof God and it reaches every creature\n\n\nIt is love flowing from the heart of God to every corner of the\nworld to every moment of history to every stratum of human life to every\nthought of the mind to every beat of the heart to every tear of a poor person\nto every burden of a parent to every smile of a child\n\n\nImagine love becoming everything in everything\n\n\nAnd for this love God did not spare the only Son but gave him up\nfor us all\n\n\nBut let us not think that God the Father coerced first the Son the\nway an abuser handles a victim\n\n\nNo Jesus makes himself available to  Abba  for\nthe fulfillment of the Father 's dream\n\n\nJesus himself says that no one takes his life away from him but he\nlays it down freely\n\n\nThis is Jesus 's obedience that comes from a heart that truly loves\nthe Father is fascinated by the Father and the Father 's plan of love\n\n\nSo for the Father and for the plan of the Father Jesus makes\nhimself unconditionally free and at the disposal of the mission given to him\nby the Father\n\n\nFrom the incarnation up to the resurrection Jesus surrenders\nhimself fully to the rule guidance and prompting of the Holy Spirit of\nmission so that as the Son he could be one with the flow of the Father 's\nlove for the world and humanity\n\n\nThis dialogue of availability this being at the disposal of the\nfulfillment of the Father 's will was maintained by Jesus even when he could\nhardly see the very meaning of his mission\n\n\nDo you remember his agony in the garden\n\n\nThere the meaning of his mission becomes dark escapes his grasp he\nis thrown into confusion loneliness and aloneness and in a pathetic way Jesus\nbegs his disciples to stay with him to assure his confused soul with their\npresence\n\n\nHe was inviting them to dialogue but they failed\n\n\nBut at that point when all meaning seems to have disappeared what\nkeeps Jesus going is his option in favor of the fulfillment of the will of\nthe Father\n\n\nIt is simply love that enables him to persevere even where\nmeaningfulness is elusive\n\n\nAnd on the cross where the Father seems to have abandoned him Jesus\nin turn abandons his spirit to the Father\n\n\nEven in the silence of the Father Jesus continues his dialogue of\ntotal availability all for love all for mission\n\n\nSome of you might say maybe at that point in Jesus 's life he was\nprobably engaging in a monologue rather than a dialogue\n\n\nThe Father was silent and the disciples could not care less huh\n\n\nBut for Jesus the cross was not a monologue but a dialogue with the\nFather waiting for fulfillment\n\n\nIn Jesus 's cross we realize that dialogue is never interrupted\nwhere there is love\n\n\nWhere there is love there is no end to dialogue\n\n\nSecondly the Paschal mystery manifests also Jesus 's love for\nhumanity that takes the form of a dialogue of solidarity with and compassion\nfor erring sinners, a dialogue of solidarity with and compassion for\nerring sinners\n\n\nYes it is true the Paschal mystery speaks of Jesus 's love and\navailability towards the Father but on the other hand it is also Jesus 's\nactive gift of life for us sinful humanity\n\n\nIn the gospel of Saint John it is said  having loved his own\nwho were in the world he loved them to the end  \n\n\nIt is as much obedience to the Father as love for us that impels\nJesus to suffer and die on the cross\n\n\nThis love for humanity takes concrete form in the Son of God 's\nhumility his voluntary decision to empty himself of the glory and splendor of\nhis divine state in order to share in humanity 's condition  which is the apex of human aloneness\n\n\nFurthermore as though this act of humility were not enough the Son\nof God even chooses to die not in the intensive care unit of some fancy\nhospital but he chose to die humiliated on a cross\n\n\nAll through self-emptying there is a preference for defenselessness\nas the way of establishing a dialogue of solidarity with human beings\n\n\nHe empties himself totally in order to give himself totally\n\n\nThe more complete the self-emptying is the more complete is the\nself-giving\n\n\nIndeed self-emptying is the other name of self-giving\n\n\nBy this dialogue Jesus no longer distances his condition and\ndestiny from those of sinners\n\n\nHe freely embraces the horror the loneliness and the poverty that\nwe human beings know only too well because of our sin without him committing\nsin\n\n\nFor our sake God made him who knew no sin to be  sin  \n\n\nSo this is another aspect of the dialogue of solidarity namely\ncompassion\n\n\nBy solidarity he who has no sin becomes a co-sufferer of sinners\n\n\nCompassion drives him to go to the place of the dead not as someone\nalive but as someone who has died\n\n\nThe Paschal mystery tells us how much Jesus loves us in freely\nembracing the suffering that is ours due to sin\n\n\nOur sinfulness blocks us from dialoguing with Jesus but he pursues\nthe dialogue by suffering our suffering crying out our cries dying our death\n\n\nFor Jesus the cross was not a monologue but a dialogue with us\nwaiting for fulfillment\n\n\nIn Jesus 's cross we learn that dialogue cannot be interrupted\nwhere there is solidarity and compassion\n\n\nAnd finally the Paschal mystery is completed in the resurrection\nand glorification of the crucified Jesus\n\n\nThe Father receives Jesus 's life offered on the cross resulting in\nthe Father 's sharing of that life to the world as the fullness of life\n\n\nIn the resurrection the Father and Son engage in a dialogue of\nmutual acceptance which leads to their dialogue of sharing of life too with\nthe world by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit\n\n\nSo the death of Jesus did not end on the cross it ended in his\nreturn to the Father in order to live fully and eternally in the Father 's\npresence and love\n\n\nThe glorification of Jesus signifies the Father 's  offered by the Son on the cross\n\n\nIn the resurrection the Father affirms the Son who on the cross\nfelt abandoned and neglected\n\n\nIn the resurrection the Father justifies the life of Jesus that was\nrejected by sinners\n\n\nIn the resurrection the Father proclaims to the world this is my\nSon\n\n\nThe resurrection is as it were the stage on which the Father\npresents to the world Jesus as the only begotten Son\n\n\nThe resurrection is the Father giving to Jesus the name above every\nother name\n\n\nAnd so the resurrection also reveals the face of God as a Father\n\n\nAfter all he did not abandon his Son\n\n\nSo the dialogue of availability of the Son on the cross has finally\nreceived a response from the Father a response of acceptance in the\nresurrection\n\n\nAnd this consummated dialogue and mutual  acceptance\nbrought forth the outpouring of the Spirit to us\n\n\nThe same Spirit who led Jesus to mission will now be given to us so\nthat we could dialogue with God\n\n\nThrough the Holy Spirit many men and women will know Jesus will\nreceive Jesus will follow Jesus and be united with the Father being able to\ncry out  Abba  the way Jesus does\n\n\nThe three aspects of dialogue in the Paschal mystery the dialogue\nof availability the dialogue of solidarity and compassion the dialogue of\nmutual acceptance and sharing of life\n\n\nFinally the Christian family and the spirituality of the Paschal\nmystery\n\n\nLet us now apply the three aspects of the fa Paschal mystery that\nwe have singled out to the family as a community of dialogue and let their\nspirituality be that of the Paschal mystery\n\n\nFirst and here I am calling on families

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThank you,  \n\n\nDean Violeta Vicente the College of Business and Economics, Atty Jose Dy Chairman Commercial Law Department, De La Salle faculty members officers and members of  Ley  La Salle and guests\n\n\nI 'd like to thank Atty Emmanuel Sales your faculty adviser for his kind and generous introduction\n\n\nThe introduction was so well researched that it can only emanate from an associate justice of the Supreme Court  \n\n\nWell uh, next time he files a petition I will remember the counsel for the petitioner Atty Emmanuel Sales   \n\n\nWell my friends I also recall having appeared before your Dean in nineteen eighty-nine\n\n\nAnd I had difficulty articulating my remarks at that time in nineteen eighty-nine in Cebu at the Cebu Plaza \n\n \n\n\nWell my friends it is indeed a pleasure to speak before a select assembly of fellow La Sallites\n\n\nI say fellow La Sallites because during last Saturday 's commencement exercises I was conferred an honorary doctorate in management by your I mean our University which according to Brother President Rafael Donato made me an instant La Salle alumnus \n\n\nAt the outset I wish to commend and congratulate the officers and members of the  Ley  La Salle for organizing and spearheading the ongoing fora which focus attention and elicit discussion on timely and paramount issues of the day\n\n\nI also wish to thank them for selecting a subject of vital concern to the nation and which I must admit is a topic close to my heart the administration of justice in the Philippines\n\n\nIndeed the continuing dynamism of avenues of information and dialogue between the judiciary and our people is imperative if we are to sustain the momentum of reforms we have initiated in the past five years\n\n\nOur people must be made more aware of our resolve to bring to them a judicial system that effectively functions to safeguard their rights so that they may find enough reason to keep faith in our system of justice\n\n\nWe must keep that faith alive for without it the very survival of the democratic institutions we have tried to rebuild in the aftermath of the former regime may be irreversibly prejudiced\n\n\nIn this spirit let me then bring you closer to the arena of the Philippine judiciary\n\n\nI shall endeavor to guide you through the terrain of reforms we have explored in the past few years of my incumbency as principal steward of our judicial system\n\n\nThrough the years the integrity of our judicial system as the haven of truth and the bulwark of equality before the law has been persistently questioned\n\n\nOur people increasingly confounded by laws they cannot seem to comprehend and court procedures that are as  fearfully  incomprehensible are unable to know how to protect the rights and liberties\n\n\nWorse the high cost of legal assistance and litigation the tortuously slow pace of court proceedings and the reality of corruption that has placed price tags on rights and liberties have further exacerbated our people 's alienation and sense of mistrust in our judicial system\n\n\nA people bereft of faith in the reality of truth justice and equality in society is like a dagger poised to strike at the very heart of our democracy\n\n\nWe had to reverse the tide of cynicism alienation and distrust\n\n\nTowards this end a blueprint for judicial reform was born\n\n\nOur end goal an independent moral and efficient judiciary\n\n\nI have brought the message of the Philippine judicial reform to every available forum here and abroad as my time and schedule permit\n\n\nIn all my appearances in various parts of the country before lawyers judges and government organizations I have tried to impress the urgency of these reforms\n\n\nAllow me to share with you some of the recurring questions asked in these fora as a springboard of my discussion on the extent of reforms we have so far been able to initiate\n\n\nWhat measures have been adopted to ensure that only qualified persons of proven integrity and competence are chosen as judges in our courts\n\n\nWe have fully activated the Judicial and Bar Council a constitutionally mandated body composed of members of the judiciary and selected members of the bar to screen prospective appointees to judicial positions\n\n\nAside from extensive investigation and appraisal of qualifications the Council publishes the list of nominees to enable any citizen to question the fitness of those whose names are included in the list\n\n\nSo if you feel a person is incompetent if you feel a person is dishonest or does not have does not possess integrity then feel free to object to his nomination by writing the Judicial and Bar Council\n\n\nThereafter the Council draws up at least three names for each judicial office for submission to the President whose choice is limited to the list submitted\n\n\nNot only does the Council ensure that only those who are qualified are to be appointed the Council also ensures that the process of judicial appointment is insulated from the vagaries of political pressure and patronage\n\n\nGiven the risk and paucity of remuneration for judicial officers what have we done to attract the best and the brightest into the judiciary\n\n\nFor your information the lowest paid justices of the Supreme Court in Asia-Pacific region we just learned about it last week when we were in Perth Western Australia are the members of the Indian Supreme Court\n\n\nThey receive only three hundred U S dollars a month three hundred which is even lower than our municipal trial court judge\n\n\nBut the highest paid Supreme Court associate justice in the Asia-Pacific region are the justices of Singapore\n\n\nAnd they receive twenty-five thousand U S dollars per month plus a brand new Mercedes Benz plus the use of a government house plus free light  water  etcetera etcetera  \n\n\nSee so and yet in spite of that not very many are attracted to join the judiciary because they make more money in the practice of law\n\n\nThere are multitudes of qualified members of the bar who are sincerely committed to dedicate their talents to the judiciary\n\n\nBut to fortify that commitment so that they can make the final leap into our court system there is the guarantee of security of tenure\n\n\nThe Constitution proscribes the Martial Law practice of reorganizing the judiciary as it was done during the Marcos administration in a manner that prejudices the security of tenure of judges\n\n\nIn addition we have also rationalized existing pay scales although we are still lagging behind all the many countries in the Asia-Pacific  region\n\n\nIn addition we have also rationalized our existing pay scales and benefits so as to assure prospective judges of adequate remuneration\n\n\nBeyond these considerations are the irrevocable lures of rendering meaningful public service as well as the dignity and respectability that come with the position of a judicial officer\n\n\nAssuming we  we appoint qualified judges to the bench how do we guarantee that they will perform creditably and efficiently\n\n\nWith regard to newly appointed judges the Supreme Court conducts an orientation program composed of various seminars  designed to equip new judges with court administration and decision writing skills\n\n\nAs regards our existing crop of trial judges we have instituted a judicial career development program to update their knowledge of the law and upgrade their case and court management skills\n\n\nParallel to our programs to enforce and instruct our judges is a continuing effort at sustaining the highest level of judicial discipline\n\n\nTo this end the Supreme Court promulgated a code of judicial conduct which sets a framework of ethical standards that must be set by members of the judiciary\n\n\nYet in this arena public support and the support of lawyers groups is vital if we are to completely eradicate misfits in the judiciary\n\n\nFrom nineteen eighty-three to nineteen eighty-five before we joined the Court while there was still an authoritarian government no R T C judge was dismissed from the service by way of administrative proceedings although many were eased out by way of reorganization\n\n\nSince nineteen eighty-six when I joined the Court thirty-four judges were admonished and warned nine judges have been reprimanded twenty-six imposed a fine one suspended and twelve dismissed from the service\n\n\nAs for erring lawyers we have instituted a more systematic grievance procedure through appropriate amendments to the rules of court\n\n\nThe new grievance procedure allows for erring lawyers to be investigated and disciplined by their peers in the Integrated Bar who after all are in a better position to assess the veracity of complaints against their fellow lawyers\n\n\nIn addition to and with the purpose of narrowing down the latitude of temptations for unscrupulous and irresponsible conduct the Supreme Court implemented a program for periodic visitation and performance evaluation of judges\n\n\nTasked to administer the court performance monitoring system is the judicial planning and development implementing office headed by a former member of the board of trustees of De La Salle University Justice Cecilia Mu&ntilde;oz-Palma\n\n\nNow while we punish the erring judges we also reward the good ones those who perform excellently\n\n\nWe commend them and at the same time we give them awards by way of this Judicial Excellence Award\n\n\nYou know last June eleven we gave six judges special awards as outstanding judges three of them regional trial court judges and the other three metropolitan and municipal court trial court judges\n\n\nAside from the awards and plaques that they received they we gave them fifty thousand pesos each\n\n\nIn other words if you are a good judge and you are chosen an outstanding judge on a yearly basis you will receive a cash prize of fifty thousand pesos not given by the government or by the judicial funds but by the Judicial Excellence Foundation\n\n\nBut easily the most critical arena of concern is the problem of court delay and pathetically clogged court dockets\n\n\nWe have been asked frequently what we have done to remedy these perennial afflictions of the judiciary\n\n\nAll right first let us talk about the Supreme Court because you know after I assumed as Chief Justice the complaint of many is, Chief my case has been pending for so many years until now it has not been resolved can we not speed up the judicial process \n\n\nSo we had to look for ways and means to speed up the judicial process\n\n\nWell one possible explanation is there are just too many cases\n\n\nWith a fast-growing population and not enough judges for the purpose it would be just well nigh impossible to dispose of these cases speedily as they come in fast\n\n\nWell anyway we have adopted certain reforms but first with respect to the Supreme Court\n\n\nFor so many years the number of cases filed with the Supreme Court exceeded the number of cases disposed of by the Supreme Court\n\n\nSo that every year the backlog kept on mounting  ha  at an alarming proportion as in a time will come when so many cases will be pending for ten or so years and they will not be disposed of\n\n\nSo we had to redouble our efforts\n\n\nWe had to engage the services of more researchers\n\n\nWe had to adopt measures like memorandum decisions\n\n\nIn other words don't make your decisions too long although that is the defect of many\n\n\nEach justice feels that every decision should be a  magnum opus  \n\n\nIt should not be that way uh\n\n\nA memo decision briefly a few pages would suffice as long as you state the facts the issues involved what is the law applicable and then the ruling of the Court\n\n\nSo, working speedily and uh every day I used to hear the complaint of my associate justices but never mind if they are complaining anyway their production improved\n\n\nAnd in nineteen eighty-nine for the first time after so many years we were able to turn the tide\n\n\nAnd for the first time the number of cases filed, was below the number of cases disposed of\n\n\nIn other words more cases were disposed of than the number of cases filed\n\n\nThis is the exact figure \n\n\nIn nineteen eighty-nine the Supreme Court received five thousand four hundred ninety-four cases or an average of four hundred fifty-seven docketed per month then you divide that among fifteen justices", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nMy professor pastor uh Brother Gregory my colleagues in the History Department and other departments who are represented here\n\n\nOh I 'm sorry Dean uh Presentacion Gabriel uh dear students\n\n\nI would like to talk about Manila as a microcosm of Philippine history\n\n\nThe things I 'm going to say might not be really new to some of you but uh what I intend to do is to telescope this in one continuous narrative \n\n\nToday Greater Manila also known as Metro Manila or the National Capital Region comprises the four cities of Manila Quezon Caloocan and Pasay and the thirteen municipalities of Muntinlupa Para&ntilde;aque Makati Las Pi&ntilde;as Pateros Taguig Mandaluyong Pasig San Juan Marikina Malabon Navotas and Valenzuela\n\n\nIt is a sprawling metropolis which according to the nineteen-ninety national census has an aggregate population of seven point eight million which is the  which is thirteen percent of the total Philippine estimated population of uh sixty point five million, \n\n\nRanked the world 's twenty-third largest city in nineteen eighty-five Manila by the year two thousand is projected to have eleven point one million population thus becoming the sixteenth in ranking outgrowing such megalopolises as Los Angeles London Moscow and others\n\n\nEven today Manila has a bigger population than countries such as Kuwait Bayra Bahrain El Salvador Ireland and New Zealand among many others\n\n\nAs one of the great metropolises of the world Metro Manila shares the comforts and amenities of modern-day living\n\n\nWithin its confines are a world class Cultural Center complex well-planned and luxurious subdivisions of the rich architecturally impressive high rise condominium office and residential buildings spanking hotels antiseptic hospitals with the latest in equipment and highly trained personnel theaters, museums art galleries and modernistic shopping centers\n\n\nAfter years of dictatorship it now boasts of a democratic system of government, at times seemingly confused and directionless and one of the freest if licentious presses of the world\n\n\nAlas Manila also shares the common problems of huge cities like river land and air pollution impossible traffic jams mass unemployment festering slums smelly and dirty children roaming city streets and alleys male female and child prostitution and a crime rate which however is not much more than that of Chicago and New York\n\n\nManila had in the past witnessed historical developments that had made imprints and its emergence growth and development which have cast and will long continue to cast their shadow for many more years to come\n\n\nManila had for instance witnessed the arrival of the Spanish Dutch American and Japanese invaders who came trampling its sacred shores\n\n\nThe Dutch never made a permanent inroad in Manila \n\n after many attempts they retreated to nearby present-day Indonesia which they also dominated for hundreds of years\n\n\nNor did the British or the Japanese whose occupation of Manila lasted no more than a few years\n\n\nBut the Spaniards remained and ruled the Philippines for over three hundred years from fifteen sixty-five to eighteen ninety-eight and  made Manila the religious military political cultural economic and business center of the whole archipelago\n\n\nThe Americans who followed the Spaniards ruled the Philippines for over forty years nine eighteen ninety-eight nineteen forty-five also made Manila the center of the Philippine of Philippine life\n\n\nIts political military educational cultural and business machinery centered in the city\n\n\nThe very early origins of Manila are however buried in the misty and remote past\n\n\nThe early Filipino settlements long before the foreign invaders came were found along seacoasts the banks of rivers and lakes\n\n\nNot only did these give food for the populace and later irrigation for the agricultural lands they also provided the needed transport from one pre-colonial village to the other and thus facilitated the exchange of persons goods and ideas\n\n\nThe early settlement of what is now known as Maynila as Manila was established along the Pasig River Manila Maynila to the south facing Manila Bay and to the north Tondo\n\n\nClosely close-by were the villages which eventually became the towns forming later the  arrabales  of the city\n\n\nSince time immemorial Manila because of its strategic location was post to early Chinese Japanese Arab and Southeast Asians by chance who came in search of the of its products and bartered their own\n\n\nBefore <unclear> words </unclear> galleon trade between the Philippines and Mexico which sustained the Spanish colonial rule was centered in Manila\n\n\nManila also saw the establishment of the early factories in the country\n\n\nThe cigar and cigarette factories during the Spanish colonial regime were tourist attractions\n\n\nAnd today all types of factories appliances food processing garment, automotive and chemical industries among many others are found in the Metro Manila area\n\n\nFrom Metro Manila American Japanese Chinese Taiwanese and Korean multinational companies direct their nationwide activities\n\n\nMany of the pre-colonial Chinese and Japanese traders opted to stay and married native women and thus enriching the early Filipino racial strains and for that matter the emergent Filipino culture\n\n\nEven before the intrusion of the Chinese and Japanese Manila had already developed its own culture its political structures however however basic and simple they might have been\n\n\nIt evolved its early arts and lifestyle its religious beliefs its own economy its social classes and immediately prior to the Spanish occupation in  in the fifteen seventies even began to evolve the beginnings of the institution of royalty which at that time had already been  aligned  and related to the royal house of Borneo\n\n\nSuch culture and lifestyle would be further enriched by the cultures of the other nations which came to the country\n\n\nSo that today Filipino culture is a mixture of an indigenous Malay substratum with the various layers of Chinese Indian Muslim Spanish Mexican American and to a very minor extent even Japanese culture\n\n\nSuch influences may perhaps best be discerned in the racial stock which resulted from the various contacts with other peoples so that today hardly is there a Filipino much less a Manile&ntilde;o who has no mixed blood running in his veins and possibly in Manila more than in any other part of the archipelago is this more evident\n\n\nI think we just look at each other to realize what I mean to say\n\n\nIndeed today in spite of the outward veneer of what appears to be a dominant American influence like American music movies T V programs and the popular arts junk fast foods hamburgers even American lingo the deeper and the more perpa pervasive influence is Hispanic\n\n\nThe Catholic religion and its deep influence in cultural in culture and lifestyle is a heritage from Spain\n\n\nThat the Philippines and Manila for that matter shares with the other Latin American countries and cities of Spanish origin\n\n\nWhile Manila as it is very apparent from the outside shares some characteristic architectural similarities of the old churches and cathedrals ancient public and private edifices and indeed certain similarities in their social classes the  peninsulares  the  creonos    creo&ntilde;os   the  mestizo  groups and native indigenous Indian population Manila has certain characteristics which differentiates it from Spanish American cities like Buenos Aires Lima or Mexico City\n\n\nThis is of course understandable inasmuch as while Manila shares with these cities Spanish colonial rule for hundreds of years differences in geography and later day historical developments have made such differences imperative\n\n\nManila for instance because of its peculiar relation to the outside world had had much more contacts with other nations that had than had the cities mentioned above\n\n\nAs a result the population of Manila had had much more varied racial mixing than that of the Spanish-American cities\n\n\nThe historical development of the Philippines and Manila is also something else\n\n\nExcept for Puerto Rico which like the Philippines passed on to American rule after years of Spanish rule none of the South and Central and even North American countries passed on to other to another foreign rule after the Spanish colonial experience\n\n\nThese countries became independent soon after their wars of independence against Spain\n\n\nLocated at practically the center of the Philippine archipelago Manila has provided the vortex towards which the country 's population gravitated, \n\n\nIt is thus it thus became the political center of the country \n\n Hardly had the last smoke of the battle between the Spanish invaders and the native defenders of Maynila and Tondo cleared when the Spanish authorities established the amenities of an Iberian city\n\n\nThe City of Manila had formed was formally established in June fourteen fifteen seventy-one with its own  ayuntamiento  city hall and its own  cabildo  and later its   Royal Audiencia  the Supreme Court which also took over the reins of government when the governors-general resigned died or were incapacitated and its city council whose members conducted the day-by-day affairs of the city\n\n\nOver and above this officialdom was the governor-general the captain-general or the  adelantado  a special honorific title given only to Miguel Lopez de Legaspi the founder of the Spanish City of Manila who in effect was the highest government official and political leader of the colony\n\n\nLegaspi as it turned out led the troops in the pacification campaigns not only in the outlying areas close to Manila but also in the whole island of Luzon eminently aided by his grandson Juan de Salcedo\n\n\nHis appointment as  adelantado  of course as well as those of the higher ranking officials of Manila came from the Spanish King\n\n\nHis successors would also best be known as captains-general or governors-general who were the highest officials in the country\n\n\nAs a result of the great distance which separated Manila from the Iberian metropolis and from the vice-royalty of New Spain or Mexico under which it was ruled for quite some time and the other Spanish colonies the Spanish governor-general in Manila embodied in his person powers other than political\n\n\nAs representative of the Spanish King in this the farthest outpost of the vast Spanish empire he also had military diplomatic even religious powers\n\n\nThe Spanish governor general who held office in Manila also commanded the Spanish army in the islands\n\n\nAs commander-in-chief he planned military campaigns and came out with strategies to quell local uprisings and repel the attacks of foreign invaders like the Dutch and the Chinese and local enemies like the Muslims from Southern Philippines who sporadically attacked the Christian Filipino settlements along the coastal regions\n\n\nAnd now with religious powers he would send missionaries to  nearby China and Japan not only as missionaries but even as diplomats who had ambassadorial ranks to establish relations with these countries\n\n\nThe Spanish governor-general thus presided over the affairs of the colony\n\n\nLike him other ranking officials of invading troops like the latter day Americans and the Japanese would also reside in Manila initially with great military powers attached to their ranks and only later when these had more or less been established to  obtain  formerly established political structures and appoint civil and military officials who would help them rule the colony\n\n\nManila under the Spaniards and to a certain extent under the Americans but even more so the Spaniards maintained a strict code regarding the social mixing of the various groups in the colony, \n\n\nAs in the other parts of the Spanish empire the peninsular Spaniards occupied the highest rung of the colonial social ladder\n\n\nFrom their ranks came the military political religious leadership of the colony\n\n\nNext in rank in the were the Philippine-born Spaniards or the creoles who were considered the original Filipinos or Filipinos  Espa&ntilde;oles  who while having Spanish blood on both sides of their ancestry were considered lower in rank than the peninsulars and therefore could not, assume the highest offices of the colonial administration\n\n\nSpanish and Chinese  mestizos  born of Spanish and Chinese fathers as the case may be and of native or of  mestizo  mothers had higher social status than the mass of indigenous Malay natives or the  indios  \n\n\nBy the  eighteen seventies however when the three priests Burgos Gomez and Zamora who were executed allegedly for their complicity in the so-called Cavite mutiny of  eighteen seventy-two the various sectors of Philippine society had begun to view themselves as Filipinos and begun to weld themselves together as a group distinct and apart from Spanish  peninsulares  \n\n\nThis welding together of these Filipino groups and the awareness of a common destiny was made more apparent during the propaganda movements when creoles Spanish and Chinese  mestizos  and local natives the  indios  pooled together their resources to advance the Filipino cause in Madrid and in other European capitals like London and Paris and in nearby Hong Kong\n\n\nWell a few of these propagandists like Marcelo del Pilar and the Pardo de Tavera brothers were already young professionals at the time\n\n\nMost of propagandists like Rizal Jose Maria Panganiban  were young men studying in Spain\n\n\nThey maintained links with their countrymen in the Philippines mainly with those living in Manila\n\n\nMany came from the land-owning and the merchant class as a result of the opening of the Philippines to foreign trade in the nineteenth century and the cultivation of export crops like sugar Manila hemp indigo and to a very minor extent coffee\n\n\nThis  this class formed by rich Creole and  mestizo  families not only built substantial so-called earthquake baroque houses found in Manila, and could afford the amenities of contemporary living such as carriages imported from Austria furniture and  chandeliers pianos harps and other prestige symbols from abroad not to say books and newspapers some of which were proscribed by the colonial regime for the subversive ideas that they were supposed to contain", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "24acf276-2c36-4c9f-91df-ff4e8e8ef2fd", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\n Maraming maraming salamat po't maraming salamat po't magandang umaga sa inyong lahat  \n\n\nUh in behalf of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources it is a gle great pleasure to be here with you today especially since I 'm among the youth the very people who will inherit this land this planet from our generation and the people responsible for humankind 's ecological future\n\n\nIt was the mistaken notion molded by an education of the past era that has led us to the problems which we face today in environment\n\n\nThis mistaken notion that man can subjugate nature and his environment has led us to the destruction of our forests the pollution of our air and our waterways and the general despoliation of the natural quality of life on earth\n\n\nOne of the most revealing lessons learned during the past two decades of environmental awakening in the Philippines is that the maintenance of the earth 's delicate balance by the prophylactics of pollution control and other ecological mitigation measures cannot ensure environmental harmony\n\n\nThere is now a compelling need to overhaul existing concepts of development with its traditionally exclusive focus on economic principles and political economy of natural resources and marry marry these concepts with the imperatives of nature and the environment\n\n\nThe evidence of our failed delusions is all around us\n\n\nThe disappearance of our once lush forests has resulted in floods or on the other extreme a soon to be expected drought again\n\n\nBecause of such phenomena we have seen the destruction of our crop lands and the attendant problems such as famine and greater poverty, \n\n\nPollution on the other hand has killed many of our rivers and streams\n\n\nIn Metro Manila all of our rivers are biologically dead destroying our fishpond habitats and aiding the multiplication of disease vectors\n\n\nAir pollution and this you see very often has likewise thickened the atmosphere of our urban centers creating the health problems previously thought of to exist only in highly industrialized countries, \n\n\nThe main causes of deforestation alone are socially and economically rooted\n\n\nThe demographics of the uplands have changed tremendously from those of a quarter of a century ago due to the migration of marginalized lowlanders to the last frontiers of the uplands\n\n\nMany of these lowlanders were forced to migrate to the uplands because of low farm incomes caused by inappropriate food pricing policies increasing costs of farm inputs and by the diminished soil fertility\n\n\nThen too we should not forget the social conditions caused by a deeply rooted feudalism whose grip continues its hold in our rural areas to this very day\n\n\nThe flight of these hapless farmers to the uplands has swelled the numbers of uplanders all over the country to as many as eighteen million Filipinos imagine that eighteen million Filipinos in the uplands that 's the forests and the mountains\n\n\nAnd they have put an equivalent and even growing pressure on the fragile upland ecosystem\n\n\nImagine the kind of pressure that eighteen million Filipinos will bring to our uplands for housing and infrastructure for firewood for slash-and-burn agriculture and of course the lure to participate in the profitable illegal logging activities\n\n\nThis has in turn created more problems for the lowlands resulting in floods and siltation which has robbed our croplands of their vitality thus exacerbating the already marginalized small farmers\n\n\nThis situation has only encouraged more migration either to the uplands or to the already crowded urban areas and even to the even more fragile coastal areas\n\n\nThus a vicious cycle of poverty and degradation has been created feeding into itself and locked in place by social inequity and injustice\n\n\nAnd yet we suffer all of these things without the material progress achieved in the developed quote unquote west but only with the poverty that the depleted and despoiled natural resource base brings\n\n\nQuite obviously the answer to this vicious cycle is a systemic one solutions that will drive wedges that will break this cycle\n\n\nWe have found out that traditional concepts of economic growth of development at all cost caused environmental degradation\n\n\nHowever this unbridled pursuit of progress has for many developing countries including the Philippines resulted in quite the opposite where the degraded environment in turn causes poverty resulting in an ever descending cycle of penury and ultimately death\n\n\nThe perceived solution is the concept of sustainable development which calls for use of natural resources for development in such a way that the current generations will not foreclose or preclude the use by future generations of the same resources\n\n\nHarvesting only the increment without touching the base\n\n\nExpending only the interest without touching the capital\n\n\nIn the face of these the government has gradually integrated this concept into pertinent policies affecting the environment through the Philippine strategy for sustainable development\n\n\nSustainable development stresses the need to view environmental protection and economic growth as mutually compatible and in third world countries mutually reinforcing even inextricably linked \n\n This implies that the growth objectives should be compatible not only to the needs of society for greater equity and social justice but also to the natural dynamics and carrying capacity of the earth 's ecosystem\n\n\nFollowing the P S S D therefore government and society are called upon to look back to the root cause of this problem which among others is the inequity that continues to fan discontent in the rural areas\n\n\nThere are three root causes of environmental degradation that we have found\n\n\nOne is great overpopulation and continuing increase in population\n\n\nSecond is the pervasive poverty of our people\n\n\nAnd third most important and systemic difficulty is the lack of social equity, \n\n\nThe uh concepts like land reform rural industrialization agricultural pricing policies that are not biased towards the wants only of the urban population should therefore be pursued\n\n\nYou have to remember that whenever you in the urban areas  require demand for lower prices of rice for example you rob the marginalized farmers in the uplands and in the rural areas of due profit, \n\n\nSo, we say that, in rural development that could help seventy percent of our population catch up with the opportunities and resources available to their luckier urban brethren should be made a reality\n\n\nAnd to those already in the uplands we should offer opportunities that will make them realize that planting trees and nurturing forests are more rewarding both in the short and the long term than cutting them down\n\n\nWe need to show these upland farmers that the opportunities they have come to look for in the forests in the mountains in the uplands can only be obtained if the forests are still there\n\n\nFor the last four years this has been the crux of our Department 's policies and programs for the uplands to offer security of tenure and better livelihood in exchange for security of forests\n\n\nSuch programs for example as the national forestation program where large swaths of denuded forests are being planted are now being used in order to contract families who are in the uplands\n\n\nMarginalized families who would otherwise not have any income contracted out in order to plant trees for the government and get paid for it\n\n\nSo that we no longer wait for the trickle-down effect of the economy but we insist that at the very first instance the profit and the benefit of the economy should go directly to the upland farmers\n\n\nThe integrated social forestry program for example\n\n\nWe have eighteen million Filipinos who are potential  kaingeros  in the forests\n\n\nIn the integrated social forestry program this calls for granting every family in the uplands who are now squatters or considered squatters 'cause they do not have uh rights or access to that land would be given three hectares or thereabouts for twenty-five years, renewable for another twenty-five years\n\n\nSo they could plant a little  vegetable or whatever they want\n\n\nIn return they should keep the forest intact at least the forest within their three hectares\n\n\nAnd the community forestry program this is the most important program we are going into because this would transfer large areas twenty thousand ten thousand hectares of forest land from the private sector uh usually the timber license agreement holder or the T L A holder now considered the loggers they are called\n\n\nFrom the loggers to be transferred to the community who are really better protectors of the forest\n\n\nIt is hoped that with the  community forestry program the farmers would understand that if they keep the forests intact they will be the ones to be able to extract rather than the foreigners or the rich people from Manila and the other urban areas\n\n\nSo that they will be reinforced they will be given incentive to really protect the forest because nobody else can protect it\n\n\nGovernment cannot protect it\n\n\nGovernment does not have money\n\n\nTherefore these programs have been revitalized and implemented complementarily in order to help the uplanders fulfill their dreams of land to till of a place to live in livelihood through reforestation and future opportunities through small scale logging and agro-forest and agro-forestry activities\n\n\nAs I said wedges to break the vicious cycle\n\n\nBut still this is not enough\n\n\nAs we have said again before the greater changes lie in structural solutions\n\n\nThese are the better <unclear> 1 word </unclear> that we must take now or forever resign ourselves to an impoverished and despoiled country\n\n\nThis requires changing attitudes about wealth about development and even about day-to-day habits in other words moving towards sustainable development as a way of life\n\n\nThough interventions can begin today toward reforming our lifestyles and our conventions complete transformation to sustainable development can only be realistically achieved during the next generation\n\n\nThis is the reason why we always take time out to talk to the youth for it is your generation which will complete this transformation\n\n\nIt is your ideas your concepts of equity and justice your concern for the poor your concern for the environment your selflessness rather than selfishness and your untiring efforts upon which a new order a sustainable society can and will be built\n\n\nSeek the truths now\n\n\nFor we of the older generation shall soon hand over the baton to the next generation who will lead us hopefully to a bright prosperous and environmentally secure future\n\n\nThank you and good day \n\n \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n Thank you uh Allan for that wonderful introduction\n\n\nMr Rex Villareal President of uh, <unclear> words </unclear> who invited me and the officers of the La Salle 's Business Management Society  \n\n\nGood afternoon fellow La Sallites and friends\n\n\nI 'm back here in our campus after a long absence and I 'm happy to be back\n\n\nI have come this afternoon upon the invitation of some of the De La Salle leaders to have an exchange of views to De La Salle community\n\n\nAnd I am looking forward to our discussion\n\n\nI welcome this opportunity to have this dialogue with you\n\n\nI have come to realize that the learning process never ends\n\n\nAnd so I have come today not only to be able to present some of my views on matters which affect all of us, but also to listen and learn from each and everyone of you\n\n\nI hope you will make this brief visit a fruitful one by your active participation in the open forum which should follow my very brief remarks\n\n\nDe La Salle will always hold pleasant memories for me  \n\n\nThis is where I grew up and was the scene of my formative years\n\n\nBut I did not join you today to talk about the good old days nor dwell in the past\n\n\nI came to talk a little about our future as a people and as a nation\n\n\nThere are few unaware that these are not the best of times for virtually every Filipino\n\n\nThe country remains poor as ever\n\n\nThree out of four Filipinos are living below or close to the poverty line\n\n\nCrisis confronts our people in virtually every aspect of their existence whether it be economic political or social\n\n\nEven college graduates are no longer assured of jobs once they are through with their studies\n\n\nTens of thousands of our professionals now have to seek employment abroad in order to be assured of a decent life\n\n\nThe prospects for our economy are not nearly as bright as they used to be\n\n\nPhilippine business would have to contend with the shortages of money energy and credit\n\n\nIn the meantime, the labor force would have to grapple with less employment opportunities and high prices which erode the meager savings of our people\n\n\nAnd yet despite the many problems we face as a people I have not yet given up on this country\n\n\nI am still hopeful that we can carve out for ourselves a better future and a brighter tomorrow\n\n\nBut we must get our act together as a people\n\n\nI urge you the students of De La Salle to be more aware of our national situation and to be more involved in our efforts to set things right in this country\n\n\nIt is our obligation yours and mine to do what we can to get this country back on its feet\n\n\nI am sure you realize you belong to a privileged class for indeed you do belong to a privileged class\n\n\nEveryone who gets a chance to have a college education and graduates belongs to an increasingly small minority\n\n\nI am told that only eighteen percent of those who enter grade school finally finish college\n\n\nThat is a drop-out rate of eighty-two percent a statistic that we must attempt to change if we have to have the people to manage our growth or uh our growth and development in the future\n\n\nBut along with this privilege comes responsibility because you belong to this group which is better educated and possesses the skills which will prove valuable to Philippine society\n\n\nYou must therefore be prepared to take on greater burdens\n\n\nAmong the many things we must do as a people in order to move ahead I believe the most important among them would be to focus on three things\n\n\nFirst we must try to focus our energies and our resources bringing about the recovery in our economy\n\n\nOur people need jobs\n\n\nGovernment needs more revenues\n\n\nStudents like you and the fresh graduates need more opportunities and avenues for <unclear> 1 word </unclear> \n\n\nOur people must be productive rather than idle\n\n\nThe way to our survival is creation of new and more than\n\n\nSecond we need reforms in our government\n\n\nReforms that would reduce corruption\n\n\nReforms that could assure the people particularly those who have less in life that basic services would be available to everybody without fear or favor\n\n\nReforms that would make government and public officials more responsive to the needs of every citizen\n\n\nAnd finally we need leadership\n\n\nWe need leaders who could organize our people motivate and inspire them to take on the burdens of rebuilding this nation\n\n\nLeaders who could form governments which in turn could impose order and restore stability so that we could live peaceful and eventually prosperous lives\n\n\nPolitics has become too important to be left to politicians alone\n\n\nAll of us must now be involved\n\n\nOur prospects for the future are at stake\n\n\nI wish to remind you that your destiny is really in your hands\n\n\nTwo out of every three Filipino voters come from the ages of eighteen to thirty-nine\n\n\nIt is you who will determine who will be our leaders in nineteen ninety-two\n\n\nIt is through your activism that a new era in Philippine politics could come about\n\n\nSo be conscious of your role\n\n\nBe aware of what you can do as a group and be reminded of your responsibility not only to yourselves and to your parents but of your higher responsibility to this nation\n\n\nI have already taken up some of your time \n\n Let us now proceed to the real substance of my visit\n\n\nLet us begin our dialogue and I will be privileged to hear your views and to answer your questions\n\n\nAll I can say is I will try to answer your questions as frankly as I can as a friend and not as a politician\n\n\nThank you fellow La Sallites", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a6849d7b-f074-4b89-818e-bab3a714ec8a", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThe title of my lecture is Jose Rizal 's philosophy of religion or the religious debate between Rizal and Fr Pastels\n\n\nWe can distinguish the philosophy of religion from theology or what I will call theology proper\n\n\nAccording to William and Mabel  Sahakian   philosophy of religion is the study on the basis of reason nature or scientific facts of the existence and nature of God, the existence and nature of the soul the question of immortality and the question of natural evils,  \n\n\nClosely related to the last are the issues on miracles and the validity of prayers\n\n\nThese are the dominant topics of this branch of philosophy\n\n\nThe philosophy of religion is otherwise called natural theology or general theology\n\n\nTheology proper on the other hand studies God on the basis of the existence of holy books, like the Koran or the Bible\n\n\nIt is otherwise called dogmatic theology revealed theology or special theology\n\n\nIn the case of Christianity theology  theology deals with subjects like Christology the study of Jesus as the Christ  sotereology  the study of salvation of the soul and eschatology the study of the end of the world among others\n\n\nThese two types of theology do not necessarily conflict with each other because philosophy can be the handmaiden of theology\n\n\nPhilosophy or reason can help explain or enlighten the dogmas of religion\n\n\nWhere on occasion the possibility of a conflict looms then the parting of the ways may arise\n\n\nA number of thinkers have decided to become agnostics like  Bertrand Russell or atheists like Rudolf Carnap\n\n\nThe other possible way is simply to abandon reason when the conflict becomes imminent\n\n\nThe basic assumption here is that God can be known only if He reveals Himself to man through some divinely inspired individuals who thereby penned down these divine revelations\n\n\nReason can help in making the revelations understandable to the man on the street\n\n\nBut reason is not entitled to contradict them since they are assumed infallible\n\n\nOtherwise reason has to be discarded and in all likelihood that part of the revelation where reason fails to elaborate may be considered a mystery\n\n\nSaint Thomas Aguinas differentiates the objects of reason and of faith\n\n\nIn the natural world it is impossible to know and to believe a thing at the same time\n\n\nThe object of the intellect is knowable while the object of faith is unknowable\n\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to examine critically the religious philosophy of Jose Rizal as he expresses them in his correspondence with Fr Pablo Pastels\n\n\nThese are the mature religious ideas of Rizal\n\n\nThe correspondence consists of eight letters four each by Rizal and Pastels\n\n\nIt began in September eighteen ninety-two just a few months after Rizal was banished to Dapitan on seven July eighteen ninety-two\n\n\nBy this time most of Rizal 's major and minor works had already been published\n\n\nThe exchange of letters necessarily touched on some philosophical and theological issues because it is the correspondence between a philosopher Rizal and a theologian Fr Pastels\n\n\nRizal has written a number of works which contain religious ideas\n\n\nIt is a subject of controversy as to whether he believes in all or simply in just a few of them\n\n\nMost of these religious views are  expressed through Rizal 's characters in novels or dialogues\n\n\nSome of them were written with a presupposed contextual background and they may not truly reflect Rizal 's own religious convictions\n\n\nEugene Hazel enumerates the works which contain Rizal 's religious thoughts  Noli Me Tangere   El Filibusterismo  Rizal 's annotations of Antonio de Morga 's  Sucesos de Las Islas Filipinas  The Vision of Friar Rodriguez, the open letter entitled My Young Country Women of Malolos The Satire by Telephone The Philippines a Century Hence The Indolence of the Filipinos The State of Religiosity in the Philippines Friars and Filipinos one unfinished novel Rizal 's letters to Pablo Pastels and some religious thoughts and other miscellaneous writings and correspondence including My Last Farewell\n\n\nFr Pablo Pastels is a Jesuit priest who was the former Director of the congregation of interns which Rizal once headed at the Ateneo  Municipal  \n\n\nHe was interested in the reconversion of Rizal to the Catholic faith since he believed that the latter went astray not only politically but also religiously because of self-love which in the context appears to mean false pride\n\n\nIn a letter to Fr Antonio Obach the parish missionary to of Dapitan Fr Pastels requested the latter to tell Rizal to stop being silly by looking at things through the prism of his own judgment and self-love since no one is judge in his own case\n\n\nRizal wrote the first letter on one September eighteen ninety-two to Fr Pastels explaining that God has given man reason and self-esteem and it must be for some purpose\n\n\nIt would be impractical to look at things according to Rizal or all his affairs through the prisms of others since there are as many prisms as there are individuals and it would be difficult to know which to choose\n\n\nMoreover to look at things through the prisms of others would offend God because this is tantamount to scorning the most precious gifts which he has given to man\n\n\nWhen God endowed man a mind of his own He meant it to be used properly\n\n\nGod did not wish that one who has less brains should think like the one who has more and vice versa in the same way that no one should digest with the stomach of another\n\n\nWith respect to self-love or self-esteem Rizal says he has prayed that God should dispossess him of it\n\n\nBut God has preserved it knowing all the while what is best for each man\n\n\nSelf-love when tempered by reason can be used as a guide for man 's perfection and integrity  since it saves him from many perverse and vile acts when he has forgotten the precepts he has learned or imbibed\n\n\nRizal considers man as a masterpiece of creation so perfect in his nature that to deprive him of his component parts like reason and self-love would disfigure him and make him miserable\n\n\nRizal informs Fr Pastels that he sometimes prays but when he prays he does not ask for anything since he believes he has everything\n\n\nWhatever happens to him is God 's will\n\n\nAnd so he does not he does this or that as guided by his conscience because after all God will invariably have His own will fulfilled\n\n\nFr Pastels laments in his first reply dated twelve October eighteen ninety-two that a young man like Rizal did not decide to take better causes, than the one that led to his misfortune all because of excessive self-love or a misunderstood feeling of personal dignity\n\n\nIt was German Protestantism that separated Rizal from the Catholic faith and French Freemasonry that goaded him to filibusterism\n\n\n Noli Me Tangere  is the result of the first captivity while  El Filibusterismo  the result of the second captivity\n\n\nOne whose mind has been obstructed and corrupted by erroneous principles and unruly affections cannot be guided by the light of his own judgment and conscience\n\n\nAccording to Fr Pastels the lamp of this light is unreliable and no matter how wise a man be he cannot be so wise as not to need the help of another 's knowledge\n\n\nIt is therefore necessary to be guided by the lamp of others so to abide by the criterion, or to abide by the criterion and judgment of others\n\n\nIt is not it is a natural lamp the knowledge of which is derived from right reason\n\n\nNevertheless according to Fr Pastels we need another lamp a supernatural one that will point to us the rocks of this life and the port of salvation\n\n\nThe rest of the reply is an incursion into a discussion of theology proper which is supposed to be a rebuttal of Rizal 's first captivity\n\n\nFr Pastels explains the nature of revealed knowledge as inspired by the Holy Spirit\n\n\nHe argues that even if faith exceeds reason there cannot exist between them a true opposition because God endows the human soul with the light of reason\n\n\nSince God cannot deny faith and reason then the truth of reason cannot contradict the truth of faith\n\n\nIf there is an apparent contradiction it is either the dogmas of faith have not been properly understood or the ravings of opinion are unworthily considered as axioms of reason\n\n\nFr Pastels promises to offer a rebuttal and the future of the second captivity that is Rizal 's separatist ideas\n\n\nRizal 's second letter of eleven November eighteen ninety-two argues that although there are better causes his cause is good and sufficient for him\n\n\nHe is not sorry for the humbleness of his cause the poverty of the rewards it offers and the little talent that God has given him to serve his cause\n\n\nBut God cannot err cannot err in His acts\n\n\nHe ordains them and He knows that the future what the future will bring\n\n\nBesides Rizal says he does not aspire to eternal fame or to eternal renown\n\n\nRizal bewails the fact that Fr Pastels believes in everything he hears without investigating it first\n\n\nRizal read German books but to presume Germans had inspired him is to betray ignorance about the German people their character and their occupations\n\n\nOnly one-fourth of  Noli Me Tangere  was written in Germany one-half in Madrid and the other fourth in Paris\n\n\nNo German had heard of his book before it was published\n\n\nHe was certainly influenced by the cool cool German environment and the free industrious studious and well-administered German populace full of confidence in its future and master of its destiny\n\n\nRizal denies being a Protestant\n\n\nHe respects religious ideas but does not consider religion as the science of conveniences or an art of enjoying life\n\n\nHad he accepted Protestantism he would now be rich free and full of honors instead of being a poor deportee\n\n\nThe reference clearly points to the wealthy  Bowsted  family of France whose daughter Nellie was willing to marry Rizal only if Rizal would embrace Protestantism\n\n\nRizal did have conversations with a German Protestant minister  at Odenvoldt  for a period of three months but the discussion was dispassionate and completely free and there was a priest who joined their discussion once a month\n\n\nRizal concluded two things\n\n\nOne an idea sincerely conceived and practiced no matter how opposite it is to one 's own convictions deserves a deep respect\n\n\nAnd two religions no matter what they may be should never make men enemies but brothers and good brothers\n\n\nThe minister and the priest individually did his duty and left to God the judgment who of them interpreted His will correctly\n\n\nTruth may be polarized or obstructed and distorted when it enters one understanding\n\n\nReason can be mistaken and can be limited\n\n\nNevertheless according to Rizal it is only reason that can correct its own mistakes\n\n\nReason alone can rise  after such falls that are rather unavoidable in its long pilgrimage on earth\n\n\nNo doubt far superior to human reason is the supernatural or divine light but who can justly claim that he is the reflector of that light\n\n\nAll religions pretend to possess the truth\n\n\nMoreover says Rizal truth is seen from different angles and therefore religious moral and political truths are complex and must be studied piecemeal\n\n\nNobody has the right to judge the beliefs of others using his own beliefs as norm or criteria\n\n\nRizal promises Fr Pastels that he will elaborate and explain why his religious views are different in his next mail if the latter is interested\n\n\nRegarding separatist ideas Rizal asked Fr Pastels  who told you that my country 's welfare which is all that I seek can be attained only through separation  \n\n\nIn his second reply dated eight  December eighteen ninety-two, Fr Pastels expresses his interest in Rizal 's religious views but insists that the latter 's twofold conclusion  at Odenvoldt  is completely Protestant because it is the consecration of man 's personal judgment\n\n\nFr Pastels criticizes the German priest as a simpleton ignorant and  and must have lost the Catholic common sense because the difference between Catholics and Protestants is not a matter of opinion but a matter of faith\n\n\nHe likewise criticizes reason without being illumined by faith as dangerous  it is since it is subject to the caprices of the mad woman of the house called Lady Imagination\n\n\nThe aberrations and misdeeds of independent reason can only be corrected by reason itself illumined by faith\n\n\nIt is this alone that can save true knowledge and true religion\n\n\nTrue religion cannot tolerate these errors\n\n\nFor as Christ Christ says who is not with me is against me, \n\n\nFr Pastels is glad that Rizal believes in one personal God Creator and Lord who throws worlds into space endowed with reason and has given every individual man this tiny spark we call understanding\n\n\nHe congratulates himself that Rizal for believing in one God Creator and Lord of everything created was not a partisan to the to Cartesianism and its offsprings\n\n\nThat is to say to materialism idealism and pantheism in philosophy to liberalism in politics to deism rationalism incredulity and  indifferentism in religion to romanticism and naturalism in literature and fine arts and to positivism and egoism in domestic civil and social economy\n\n\nBut does Rizal admit the divinity of Jesus Christ and the divine institution of His Church\n\n\nTo Rizal 's query as to who is the true reflector of God 's light Fr Pastels answers that it is Jesus Christ who by virtue of His human nature is the legitimate reflector and by virtue of His divine nature is the light itself the splendor of his Eternal Father\n\n\nWhat follows in the reply is the discussion of the Holy Trinity and the miracles performed by Jesus Christ to prove His divine mission", "subdomain":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nThank you very much\n\n\nYou know the topic that uh I was given to lecture on is something that uh has been very intriguing to a lot of people because we tend to found uh institutions \n\n\nSome of us have founded institutions and so did John Baptist De La Salle\n\n\nBut I think there is a difference between what he did and what others do\n\n\nAnd I think the basic difference lies in the Acts of the Apostles when Gamaliel was quoted to have said when the new group called Christians were uhm influencing the lives of a lot of people and the enemies of Christianity were trying to to kill the movement\n\n\nAnd Gamaliel said  if this is the work of God it will stand if it is not it will founder  \n\n\nAnd I think that 's very significant because the key sentence there is  if it is the work of God  \n\n\nIf it is the work of man it will probably be seen as the work of man \n\n\n So we 're saying uh founder  siya   \n\n\nBut if it is the work of God it is God that is glorified\n\n\nAnd it is in that context that I have uh looked at this topic that I will share with you this afternoon\n\n\nAnd I 'm also looking at the very specific areas of the founder and I call these \" his trials and tribulations \" \n\n\nBecause some of us suffer because of our own doing\n\n\nOthers suffer because of God, \n\n\nAnd my sub-sub-topic is the stresses that John Baptist De La Salle had to go through\n\n\nThere have been many things said about the founder and those of you who have been following the  Signum Fidei  lecture series  and even further back like the presentations of Brother Miguel Campos can already be considered quite conversant with the life of this great but humble man\n\n\nHe is the source of our inspiration and his life is worthy of emulation\n\n\nIt is quite certain that he was of good breeding since both his parents belonged to the noble class and to the aristocracy although Brother Luke Salm claims the family belonged to the upper wealthy  bourgeoisie  class\n\n\nWe can surmise then he was brought up according to the demands of his class and was considered well-bred\n\n\nA well-bred person does not easily succumb to complaining or to whining is usually reserved is not loud and does not go for grandiosity\n\n\nToday we might describe such a person as one possessing a quiet competent quality\n\n\nWe can further surmise that John was not used to suffering nor to deprivation nor to scandal\n\n\nWhen John took on the responsibility of the Christian Schools and the training of the teachers he did not have any inkling at all of the consequences of his decision\n\n\nAs he had said one thing led to another and Providence had many surprises pleasant and unpleasant in store for him\n\n\nI would like to dwell then on an area which I consider a necessary component when one accepts the friendship of Jesus\n\n\nIt is a common complaint among those who are close to Jesus that he is a difficult pill to swallow\n\n\nJesus exacts a lot from his followers and a lot more from his close friends\n\n\nSaint Teresa of Avila in a moment of exasperation and great  suffering was reported to have uttered if this is the way you treat your friends she was referring to Jesus she said no wonder you have so few of them \n\n\nI have gone over the several bibliographies of the founder and I found The Work Is Yours the Life of Saint John Baptist De La Salle which is by Brother Luke Salm to be the most appropriate for this lecture\n\n\nThe trials and tribulations of the founder are manifested in critical incidents of his life and deal with practically every aspect of his work his relationship with his family with his peers with his teachers with the local church the local clergy with the Bishops and with his own Brothers and community\n\n\nI shall deal with each of these aspects and give examples of the difficulties that were encountered by John\n\n\nHis health and he was also accident-prone De La Salle 's health was to a large extent good\n\n\nThere are no evidence in any extant document that would indicate otherwise\n\n\nHowever due to accidents and severe living conditions he suffered much from injuries previously sustained and from prolonged exposure to the elements\n\n\nIn one trip coming back from the country De La Salle came close to losing his life\n\n\nHe was caught in a blinding snowstorm and fell into a ditch\n\n\nThe more he struggled to free himself the deeper he sank into the mire\n\n\nClose to exhaustion and about to lose consciousness he made one desperate, he made one desperate effort and was finally able to free himself\n\n\nAs a result of this experience he suffered a rupture and this rupture would recur from time to time with great pain\n\n\nWhen it recurred though it was an opportunity for De La Salle instead of complaining to thank the Lord for saving his life\n\n\nAnother example was when he crossed the Tuileries Garden in Paris he stumbled and fell\n\n\nHis knee which had already been cut open to drain an inflamed swelling was pierced through by a concealed spike in the gateway\n\n\nHe fainted on the spot\n\n\nAccording to the account the bystanders at first thought he was drunk and ignored him\n\n\nAnd it was with tremendous effort that De La Salle was able to reach the door of a community house and fell unconscious in the arms of a Brother who opened the door\n\n\nHe was prone to attacks of rheumatism which at times were so acute and so painful that he thought he might die\n\n\nThe prevalent remedy was as painful as the disease\n\n\nThe remedy was, one would be stretched over a grill beneath which were medicinal herbs steaming over burning coals\n\n\nThere was even an incident which if not for the serious consequence would have been very funny\n\n\nA young Brother trying to be helpful pulled back a chair as De La Salle was about to sit down\n\n\nThe founder lost his balance and fell on his face\n\n\nThis opened a gash in his head and later caused pain in his ear\n\n\nHe even remarked as he was suffering one headache after another that he felt as if his head were split in two\n\n\nAnother area where where the founder suffered was the area of deceit and I call this  estafa  \n\n\nDe La Salle suffered through a number of court cases that dealt with  estafa  \n\n\nIn one instance he agreed to form a partnership with a young man named Clement who was going to provide the building for his school\n\n\nHe his work was expanding and so he tried to to look for somebody who might join him in putting up a building\n\n\nAnd he was one man who said okay I will help you \n\n\nThis young man Clement was going to inherit a large amount of money and property but since he was not yet twenty-five years old which is the legal age in France at that time for this kind of transaction it was his lawyer who negotiated with De La Salle regarding this particular property\n\n\nDe La Salle advanced the money of over five thousand   livre   which was quite considerable at that time\n\n\nSo he advanced it\n\n\nWhen Clement came into money and into age he reneged reimbursing the founder and to add insult to injury he insisted that the house was his\n\n\nBecause Clement had influential contacts both in the Church and in the government he sued and De La Salle was cited to appear in court to answer to charges of suborning a minor for the purpose of extorting money from him\n\n\nDe La Salle remember was the victim and he was the one sued\n\n\nHe also had conflicts with pastors and Bishops, again not of his own doing\n\n\nDe La Salle himself a member of the clergy always showed deference to pastors and to members of the hierarchy\n\n\nHowever this was taken for weakness and he was abused by some of these men who did not return the respect the founder had for them\n\n\nThe matter of the habit was a source of difficulty with Father Baudrand\n\n\nHabit meaning the Brothers had a peculiar habit because De La Salle wanted the Brothers to look very different from the clergy at that time\n\n\nWell this Father Baudrand did not like the habit that was designed by De La Salle for his Brothers\n\n\nHe thought it was too  probinsyano  and he wanted the Brothers to dress a little bit more fashionable\n\n\nAnd De La Salle insisted that the habit spelled the identity of the Brothers and no change should be allowed\n\n\nBesides it was not the intention of De La Salle to be a diocesan congregation and insisted on the autonomy of the community\n\n\nThe consequence of this was that he made a number of enemies and some Brothers even left him siding with the pastors\n\n\nThe pastor that had a long struggle with De La Salle was Father De La Chetardie who thought that the founder was no longer fit to be a superior\n\n\nHe wrote a long memorandum to a Cardinal named Noailles describing dissension among the Brothers and that many were disillusioned with their vocation\n\n\nIn other words Father De La Chetardie concocted stories to, make sure that in the eyes of the hierarchy the Cardinal and the Bishops that De La Salle was no longer worthy to be the head of the congregation that he founded, \n\n\nAnother group that did not like De La Salle was a group called the Writing Masters\n\n\nThe Writing Masters were the prevailing teachers at that time\n\n\nThey were basically teaching writing to a lot of the richer uh members of the community\n\n\nAnd when De La Salle established his schools a number of the students of the Writing Masters asked to be admitted to the schools of De La Salle\n\n\nNot only were they better but they were free\n\n\nAnd because of the success of the Christian Schools as they were called then and because of the many of the pupils of the Writing Masters were transferring  en masse  to the Brothers De La Salle was once again the focus of attack from this group\n\n\nIn one incident as a result of the influence of the Writing Masters with the police two officers of the court accompanied by a sergeant-at-arms appeared at the school on February seven seventeen oh four took an inventory of all the school furnishings desks chairs pens ink wells and put them under seal for safekeeping pending the judgment of the court\n\n\nThey were eventually confiscated\n\n\nGroup of men just entered the classroom and the school building and took everything that was not nailed\n\n\nIn another instance sensing the rift between De La Salle and the pastors the Writing Masters aligned themselves with Father De La Chetardie and together they were able to get an edict from the diocesan chancery forbidding De La Salle to teach to engage or assign other teachers in Paris without the express permission of the Diocesan Supervisor of schools who was also not very sympathetic to De La Salle and his group\n\n\nAt the time when this happened the Diocesan Supervisor was Father De La Chetardie\n\n\nHe had problems with his own family\n\n\nDe La Salle was barely twenty-one when his father and mother died just months apart\n\n\nBeing the eldest he had to assume the responsibility to manage his  holdings and to take care of his four brothers and two sisters\n\n\nHe was also at that time studying towards the priesthood\n\n\nAlthough it entered his mind that God might have been giving a sign of another vocation he continued on with his seminary and academic training although he would not have been faulted if he took these events as signs from God that he was not meant to be a priest\n\n\nCan you imagine today if any young man was studying at the seminary or studying to be a Brother and both his parents die and he becomes the manager of a vast holdings would you think that he would continue to study for the priesthood or he would continue to stay in the novitiate\n\n A practical mind would say God is telling me that this priesthood this vocation to the religious life is not mine\n\n In the case of John Baptist De La Salle he pursued his vocation\n\n In cases like this when there was a dilemma and he was not sure what God wanted him wanted of him De La Salle undertook counsel from close friends known for holiness and deep spirituality", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "284e753b-fe3a-4cc1-a1b1-52edef78f486", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.304880+00:00"}
{"text": "<$A> \n\n Thank you\n\n\nThank you very much\n\n\nSecretary Filemon Dr Filemon Uriarte Jr our Secretary of the Department of Science and Technology the President of the National Academy of Science and Technology Dr Perla Santos-Ocampo His Excellency William Charles Waters New Zealand Ambassador to the Philippines Senior Economic Adviser Mr Jaime Augusto Zobel Deputy Director and General, General Manager of National Economic and Development Authority Mr Rafael Lotilla our very distinguished guests National Artist for Rural Sociology Dr Gelia Castillo President of the Ateneo de Manila University Reverend Fr Bienvenido Nebres former Congressman Dondon Bagatsing this conference foreign speakers and guests led by Mr Jucom Park President Korean Institute of Science and Technology my other co-workers in government other distinguished guests friends ladies and gentlemen\n\n\nAt the outset I would like to congratulate the Department of Science and Technology for successfully organizing this timely conference and spearheading the promotion of a knowledge economy in the country\n\n\nThis initiative comes at a time when globalization is integrating the world 's countries together when the international economic order is evolving into a highly integrated and electronically dynamic system and when information can be accessed in all corners of the globe at the click of a mouse\n\n\nIndeed the world today is rapidly moving towards a new economy a knowledge economy\n\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that the publication The Economist has asked in big bold letters on its cover Who Owns the  Knowledge Economy \n\n\nIt however provided the answer Nobody Owns It \n\n\nEverybody benefits from it and the world becomes richer\n\n\nThis can be illustrated with a simple example\n\n\nWhen I share a piece of cake with you you gain the cake and I lose it\n\n\nBut when I share my knowledge with you you gain it but I do not lose it\n\n\nIn fact both of us may even gain more knowledge from the exchange\n\n\nKnowledge is essential for our development and in a knowledge economy it is the generation and use of knowledge that assume the significant contribution in the creation of wealth and  in the alleviation of poverty\n\n\nIn its recent report the World Bank emphasized that if we want to live better tomorrow than today if we want to raise our living standards as a household or as a country we must do more than simply transform more resources for resources are  scarce\n\n\nWe must use those resources in ways that generate even higher returns to our efforts and investments\n\n\nOne of the most important enabling tools for the development of a knowledge economy is Information and Communications Technology or I C T\n\n\nOf the many technologies that are currently being developed and utilized I believe I C T will be the single most important technology that will bring about a knowledge economy\n\n\nThe reason for this is that I C T is an enabling technology\n\n\nLike electricity which is also an enabling technology the impact on the economy is not so much in its production though this can also be significant but in its widespread use and application\n\n\nJust as the development of electricity developments in I C T bring about new markets new products and new services these in turn bring with them new sources of revenues that contribute to economic growth\n\n\nPersonal computers have grown threefold between nineteen ninety-two and nineteen ninety-seven to one hundred twenty million and are increasingly linking the world\n\n\nIn nineteen ninety-three there were about two million Internet hosts worldwide\n\n\nIn nineteen ninety-nine this has increased exponentially to nearly forty-five million\n\n\nThe Internet 's explosive growth is making possible many economic opportunities which just a few years ago were inconceivable\n\n\nIn nineteen ninety-seven the worldwide market for I C T amounted to one point eight trillion or approximately six percent of the world G D P\n\n\nThis is forty percent higher than the level in nineteen ninety-two\n\n\nIt grew by about twenty-seven percent annually between ninety-two and ninety-seven more than five times the rate of global economic growth\n\n\nFor a country like the Philippines it is clear that a knowledge-based development can and should be pursued\n\n\nThe Philippines is an excellent position to harness the potentials of a knowledge economy\n\n\nWe are a small country prone to natural disasters whose land areas amounts to less than that of Malaysia Thailand or Indonesia and which is spread over seven thousand islands making the transport of goods very challenging\n\n\nOur greatest asset therefore is not land or natural resources\n\n\nOur greatest asset is our people who are imbued with a culture of education and a love for learning\n\n\nWe have been  blessed with a large number of highly trained and highly trainable people\n\n\nAnd since knowledge rests on people we have the basic ingredient on which to build a K economy\n\n\nThis is further confirmed by the performance of the I C T industry in the country in recent years\n\n\nIn the hardware sector our semi-conductor and electronics industry has been growing at the rate of thirty percent to forty percent per annum since nineteen ninety-three\n\n\nProducts worth nearly twenty billion dollars constituted seventy-two percent of our total exports in nineteen ninety-eight\n\n\nExports rose to twenty-five billion dollars in nineteen ninety-nine and is expected to grow to over forty-seven billion dollars in year two thousand four\n\n\nThe five hundred twelve companies involved in the industry have a total investment of over seven billion dollars and employ over two hundred eighty thousand skilled and semi-skilled workers\n\n\nThis same trend is mirrored in the software network sectors of the I C T industry in the Philippines\n\n\nMany companies have established back-office operations in the Philippines\n\n\nAmerica Online for instance operated a customer e-mail response system at Clark Field\n\n\nSome six hundred Filipinos manning workstations in the Philippines answer e-mails for A O L from all over the globe on a twenty-four hour basis\n\n\nIn short we are in a position to capitalize on our strengths and pursue a knowledge-based development and so far the demand from the I C T industry has fueled in\n\n\nHowever it is equally clear that we must do more\n\n\nThese same global I C T trends are calling us to be proactive or otherwise lose our competitive advantage and be further left behind\n\n\nIn view of the tremendous opportunities and vast potentials offered by I C T and other knowledge-based industries we have adopted a key development strategy the transformation of the country into a knowledge center in Asia by the first decade of the twenty-first century\n\n\nThe strategy calls for the exploitation of our potentials as a nation to become a major regional hub for research and development for knowledge-based technologies and as a major production platform for I T based products and services\n\n\nThrough Executive  Number  through Executive Order Number One Two Five which I issued last July nineteen nineteen ninety-nine I have endorsed the national Information Technology plan for the twenty-first century or I T twenty-one as our plan of action to guide our efforts in harnessing informations and communications technology for our global competitiveness\n\n\nI T twenty-one clearly sets our vision of becoming a knowledge center in Asia by the first decade of this century\n\n\nBut from the time we have promulgated I T twenty-one so much has changed and new developments have evolved\n\n\nThat is why I am now directing the National Information Technology Council to review the plan in the light of these changes and new developments\n\n\nI would especially want to see the wider and more effective use of I C T in government particularly in ensuring faster delivery of public services as well as transparency in government operations and transactions\n\n\nFor us to be able to partake of the many opportunities offered by the knowledge economy we have to build on our own strengths and overcome our weaknesses and the opportunities are manifold substantial and increasing spending worldwide particularly in Asia\n\n\nWe see a fast-growing global market and the Philippines is poised to claim a bigger share of this global market\n\n\nHence I have directed the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Science and Technology to work together to make sure our country 's actions are demand-driven strategic coordinated and dynamic\n\n\nThe D T I under the stewardship of Secretary Mar Roxas has taken a number of bold steps to keep our industries competitively linked to the global market generate global demand for our I C T and services and help prepare our people for the jobs of tomorrow\n\n\nFirst and most importantly I have directed Secretary Roxas to consolidate the number of dispersed E commerce efforts of the national government under a reactivated and expanded E commerce promotion council of which he is chair\n\n\nForemost on their agenda is to fulfill their mandate to formulate and coordinate the implementation of a national program and strategy for the promotion of E commerce in the Philippines\n\n\nI expect Secretary Roxas to submit this plan by the end of June\n\n\nEven as this consolidation effort is taking place however immediate concerns cannot be put on hold\n\n\nThus we have updated investment policies and undertaken promotional activities in order to keep the Philippines as the preferred location for I T related and enabled services\n\n\nGiven the present competition for investments we must ensure that we maintain our  attractiveness as an investment site or run the risk of being overlooked or sidelined by investors\n\n\nAmong the initiatives are first the development of I T Parks\n\n\nI have approved three so far namely the Eastwood Cyber Park in Quezon City the Northgate Cyber Park Zone in Alabang and the Fort Bonifacio Silicon Alley I T Park in Fort Bonifacio Taguig where competitive fiscal and non-fiscal incentives are offered\n\n\nA Software Development Park has also been established at the Subic Economic Zone and the Ayala Group has announced the proposed development of an I T Park in Cebu\n\n\nSecond the explicit inclusion of professional I T services in the investment priority plan for fiscal year two thousand\n\n\nThis means that I T related activities will enjoy prime incentives from the Board of Investments\n\n\nThird the launching of a series of focused I T investment missions to to the United States Korea Japan Europe and Australia which will promote the Philippines as the I T service hub in Asia\n\n\nSecretary Roxas is in fact in the United States for this very purpose and is scheduled to meet with a number of potential investors locators and out sources\n\n\nFourth the creation of an I C T innovation and development fund to provide venture capital for I C T business start-ups and support for I C T research\n\n\nThe National Development Corporation under the D T D T I has already identified I T as a priority and is exploring mechanisms to reach  techno-entrepreneurs\n\n\nFinally I T related activities have been highlighted under the proposed amendments to the Omnibus Incentives Act\n\n\nOur legislators  anticipate that these amendments will take effect by the third quarter of this year and will feature a number of non-fiscal incentives to match if not surpass that offered by others in the region\n\n\nSo on this note I am happy to announce that the legal framework for our country 's participation in electronic commerce is also around the corner with the passage in the senate of the E Commerce Bill\n\n\nThe bill defines our policies on electronic transactions and will enable us to participate actively in this global trend for trade and commerce\n\n\nI would like to thank Senators Ramon Magsaysay Blas Ople Juan Flavier and, Vicente Sotto for co-authoring this bill\n\n\nA national program for strategy for the promotion of E-commerce and a knowledge economy is premised on the capability to acquire and adopt global knowledge while creating knowledge locally\n\n\nThe implementation of a rational technology policy which can integrate human and technological capabilities in productive ways is indispensable\n\n\nWe will need to invest heavily in human capital in innovation and more importantly in enabling technologies that facilitate the transfer of knowledge\n\n\nThe Department of Science and Technology under the leadership of Secretary Filemon Uriarte Jr is at the forefront of this effort", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<$A> \n\nGood morning, \n\n\nUh we would like to thank the organizers for inviting us Professor Karaan and myself uh to present a paper at this Conference\n\n\nUh we were a bit hesitant about accepting the invitation since we really had not done any in-depth study of Philippine English in the classroom in the manner of the Gonzalez Alberca and Llamzon studies\n\n\nBut since the paper expected of us was supposed to be on how the policy on the use of English in education is actually being applied in our schools at the present time uh we felt that we could very well talk on that \n\n\nSo at the outset we would like to let you know that our paper, is not a definitive  categorical presentation of Philippine English in the classroom and in the playground\n\n\nRather it is more of a  a collage of concerns of English teachers, \n\n\nAfter six years of elementary schooling the Filipino student would have had approximately three thousand two hundred forty hours of instruction in English\n\n\nThat is about one thousand eighty hours learning English as a second language and two thousand one hundred sixty hours learning Science and Mathematics with uh English used as medium of instruction\n\n\nHe would have had about five hundred four hours of English as a second language and one thousand eight hours of Science and Mathematics in English in the secondary level or a total of one thousand five hundred twelve hours\n\n\nUh four thousand seven hundred fifty-two hours of English in ten years time\n\n\nThat is if neither the student nor the teacher gets absent and if neither code-mixes or if there are no suspension of classes due to typhoons fiestas floods or sports activities\n\n\nConsidering that English is learned as a second language almost exclusively in school with only the teacher as the provider of both oral and uh written input sometimes incomprehensible and the textbooks the only print material readily available it should be of no wonder that most Filipino users of English are proficient in the formal style or what can be called \" textbook English \" \n\n\nGonzalez and Alberca in their book Studies on Philippine English nineteen seventy-eight observed that Philippine English of the mass media at least for casual and formal styles seems to be by-and-large textbookish\n\n\nWritten Philippine English follows a classroom uh register classrooms a composition style prevalent in Philippine classrooms \n\n\nSpoken English is close to textbook English\n\n\nThe prevalence of spelling pronunciation is very evident\n\n\nLikewise Philippine literature in English reflects a classroom register\n\n\nA factor which may have contributed to this classroom English phenomenon is the curriculum development process in the Philippine educational system at least in the lower levels of schooling\n\n\nCurriculum development for the elementary and secondary levels is centralized in specific offices in the Bureau of Elementary Education and in the Bureau of Secondary Education of the Department of Education Culture and Sports\n\n\nThere was a time when institutions of higher learning were designated uhm, curriculum development centers\n\n\nThe Philippine Normal University was designated Curriculum Development Center for English and Filipino\n\n\nOne of its tasks was to develop the elementary and secondary level textbooks and  manuals in English and Filipino\n\n\nThese materials were to be used in all schools nationwide\n\n\nIn nineteen eighty-three the B E E or Bureau of Elementary Education implemented the New Elementary School Curriculum or N E S C\n\n\nMinimum learning competencies for English and for all other subjects in each grade level were identified\n\n\nA document titled Minimum Learning Competencies was printed and issued to all elementary school teachers in the country\n\n\nThe M L C was used as the basis for classroom instruction achievement assessment and textbook development\n\n\nIn nineteen eighty-nine the New Elementary School Curriculum was implemented in the secondary schools\n\n\nThis time desired learning competencies for English and for all the other subjects were identified\n\n\nA document titled Desired Learning Competencies was printed and copies issued to all secondary teachers nationwide and used for the same purposes as the M L C\n\n\nToday those who go to the public schools from Batanes to Tawi-tawi use the same textbooks the PRODED or Program for Decentralized Educational Development textbook uh Development uh the PRODED textbooks for the elementary level and the S E D P, uh textbooks for the secondary level\n\n\nS E D P stands for Secondary Education Development Program\n\n\nThe earlier generation of Filipinos, used Correct English uh grades one to six for language and spelling Philippine Readers for reading during the postwar years Philippine Language Series in the nineteen fifties the  the books developed by the  Philippine Center for Language Study or the P C L S books during the audio-lingual era in the Philippines and the EDPITAF books in the late nineteen seventies\n\n\nWhile privately-owned publishing houses produce textbooks for use by private schools these books are nonetheless M L C based or D L C based with additional concepts and tasks which supposedly make the books more difficult than the PRODED or S E D P books\n\n\nThis is based on the perception that private school pupils are intellectually able and can therefore cope with more difficult material\n\n\nThe avowed goal of English language instruction in Philippine schools is the development of communicative competence\n\n\nThe term has become a catch word especially among textbook writers\n\n\nMajority claim that their books develop communicative competence but fail to adequately explain or operationalize the construct\n\n\nFor purposes of this Conference and this paper we look at English in the Philippine classroom as, uh a basilect basilect uh mesolect  acrolect continuum\n\n\nWe go by the definitions suggested by the Conference organizers\n\n\nBasilect or basilect is the low form of the language usually existing only in the spoken form and clearly not regarded as proper English\n\n\nAcrolect is the high form the prestigious form of English spoken or written which is thought of as appropriate for formal contexts\n\n\nMesolect is the intervening form\n\n\nThe basilect to acrolect continuum has been regarded by many second language acquisition researchers as corresponding in many respects to the route followed by second language learners\n\n\nThey have hypothesized that L two learners progress along an interlanguage curriculum uh continuum that series of interlocking systems which Corder nineteen sixty-seven called the learner 's built-in syllabus\n\n\nInterlanguage also refers to the structured system which the learner constructs at any given stage\n\n\nSelinker nineteen seventy-two noted that many L two learners perhaps as many as ninety-five percent do not acquire competence in the target language\n\n\nThey do not reach the end of the interlanguage  uh continuum\n\n\nHe  uh they stop learning when their interlanguage contains at least some rules different from those of the target language system\n\n\nHe referred to this as \" fossilization \" \n\n\nFossilization occurs in most language learners and cannot be remedied by further instruction\n\n\nYou may recall that Braj Kachru uh considers interlanguage a myth, \n\n\nOffhand we can say that uh basilect mesolect and acrolect or the low and high varieties are found in Philippine classrooms in the speech and writing of students teachers supervisors and administrators at the elementary secondary and tertiary levels\n\n\nIn other words many school people like students may be construed as still progressing along the interlanguage continuum their speech and writing probably basilectal\n\n\nMany others like teachers and supervisors and administrators may have already reached a post-basilectal or near-acrolectal or acrolectal stage\n\n\nThat is they have reached points somewhere near the end of the interlanguage  continuum\n\n\nOther may others may have reached a point where both uh right and wrong forms have already fossilized\n\n\nIn this presentation we have restricted ourselves to acrolectal Philippine English as suggested by the Conference organizers\n\n\nWe have further restricted ourselves to written English\n\n\nWe have hypothesized that besides professional books and magazines what may also be considered acrolectal written Philippine English in the classroom is the  manuals\n\n\nThe writers and editors of these publications are assumed to have acquired a high level of proficiency in English and are specialists in language education\n\n\nTherefore they could be expected to be models and provide models of what is acceptable and prestigious English in the classroom\n\n\nIn order to test our hypothesis we decided to do a limited content analysis of a number of  manuals\n\n\nWe did not discount the possibility that unusual lexical and syntactic usage referred to as distinctive features of Philippine English by Gonzalez and Alberca may surface in the instructional materials to be examined\n\n\nIf they do their presence may be explained in several ways\n\n\nOne that the forms are acceptable and have become part of acrolectal Philippine English\n\n\nTwo that the writers and or editors committed performance errors \n\n Or three that the writers and or editors committed competence errors\n\n\nWe decided to focus our analysis on written English in the classroom simply because it is rather difficult to identify the models of spoken classroom acrolect\n\n\nUnlike Gonzalez and Alberca we hesitate to consider the influential and the elite in the higher echelons of Philippine of the Philippine educational system as the models for either careful or casual spoken English\n\n\nHaving achieved something in the profession is not always a qualification for being a model of spoken classroom acrolect\n\n\nA set of criteria other than that used by Gonzalez and Alberca in their analysis of spoken English of the mass media may have to be developed, \n\n\nBesides the analysis of  manuals that we did we 'll also present to you uh our textbook analysis done by some graduate students and uh some uh summaries of studies done by uhm some  also by some uh uh  teachers\n\n\nMay we now present the  the results of our analysis of  manuals\n\n\nWe analyzed eight  manuals written by thirteen textbook writers\n\n\nThe main purpose of a  manual is to guide the teacher use the  textbook\n\n\nHence there is an extensive use of imperatives\n\n\nThat is why some editors have commented that  manuals are too preachy\n\n\nInterrogatives come in the form of exact questions to be asked of the students but embedded in the imperative sentences\n\n\nThe explanatory notes or background information for teachers very often are couched in the declarative sentences\n\n\nOur analysis of the  manuals revealed that majority of the distinctive features of written English as identified by Gonzalez and Alberca, uh were also present in written classroom English\n\n\nHere are some examples,  \n\n These data can be quite disconcerning disconcerting to many E S L E F L teachers specialists and also to linguists\n\n Now uhm in some instances they can be magnanimous and consider the constructions to be errors of performance\n\n Nonetheless it cannot be denied that there are there are many which may be considered errors of competence that these are wrong forms or that these uh are wrong forms which have fossilized in the idiolect of the writer or they can say that or have the constructions become acceptable so that the editors pass them off as correct\n\n \n\n constructions and wring our hands in dismay and lament over the sorry state of English in Philippine classrooms or accept the forms as they are and wait until they become part of acrolectal Philippine English implications for textbook development grammar instruction and lexicography can be drawn and probably also on the editorial standards of our local publishing houses\n\n Now uh what how about our high school students what are they capable of doing in the language \n\n Pe&ntilde;aranda conducted a study to determine the syntactic complexity of the editorials feature stories and essays written by staff members of the school papers of several secondary schools in the City of Manila\n\n transformations\n\n She fond found out that as the students advanced in years the staff members used uh they also used more sentence-embedded structures and more adjectival than nominal and adverbial sentence-embedded structures\n\n She also found out that length and number of T units advanced correspondingly with advance in year level\n\n statistical predominance of sentence-embedded adjectivals the students had already mastered the use of simple adjective modifiers and that they could handle restrictive clauses \" of \" -phrases and some prepositional phrase post-modifiers relatively relatively well\n\n It should be noted however that the compositions examined were written by a select group\n\n A similar study was conducted earlier by Mendiola in fact she 's uh here right now\n\n She analyzed the constituents of noun phrase and verb phrase constructions the kinds of sentence patterns the kinds of sentences according to clause structures and the kinds of subordinate clauses used by one hundred fifty grade four five and six pupils\n\n She also used T units as a measure of syntactic complexity\n\n Mendiola found out that the length of T units increased significantly with advance in grade level \n\n structurally complex structures than grade four pupils and the pupils used adverbial clauses more frequently followed by nominal and adjectival clauses\n\n The foregoing findings bode well for our young learners\n\n We take it as a signal that they are capable of acquiring a high level of proficiency of in English of course under appropriate circumstances", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "fd5a69cc-3bf8-422e-92d6-b4b25d298061", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.307391+00:00"}
{"text": "<$Z> <XICE-PHI:#1:1:Z>  Dr Foronda Dean Bautista Mr uh Bascara Mr Hila, uh Dr Palma uh Dean uh Gabriel uh Dr Churchill, colleagues fellow students friends ladies and gentlemen good morning\n\n\nI have the honor and pleasure to have this chance of meeting you today at the opening of the lecture series of the Department of History of De La Salle University in honor of Dr Marcelino M Foronda Jr whom I consider as the father of oral and local history in the Philippines and who is at the same time the incumbent director of De La Salle University Local and Oral History Center\n\n\nAt the outset I would like to congratulate uh Dr Foronda on the occasion of his birthday and uh on the occasion of his uh having been awarded uh the Most Outstanding uh College Teacher of the Year by the  Metrobank Foundation\n\n\nI also would like to warmly congratulate uh De La Salle University for setting up its uh Local and Oral History Center designed to uh promote the study of the various aspects of Philippine history and culture, as well as to link up Filipino scholars who are interested in the promotion of scholarship on Philippine local and oral history  \n\n\nIn your academic and scholarly pursuits in this Center you are expected to arrive at the truth of local historical reality and contribute toward the cultural advance of the people of this country\n\n\nIndeed as you move toward the fulfillment of your task in this Center you must carry a tremendous burden\n\n\nI am aware that the promotion of the study of local and oral history is ever expanding in order to achieve a full understanding of the human experience of the Filipino people\n\n\nEven if your focus is just on the promotion of the study of the local human experience of the Filipino people as indeed the Center is all about there is a great variety of subject matter and themes within each of these subjects and themes laden with their own complexities and emotional overtones\n\n\nTo compound the situation there is a Babel of Filipino tongues to contend with, \n\n\nRemarkably the Center is making progress and its faculty  and staff are moving forward\n\n\nAnd I congratulate you for the progress and the advances you have made as this lecture series and the previous local and oral history conferences you have organized uh prove\n\n\n Dr Foronda just uh mentioned to me a few seconds ago that there 's going to be another local and oral history conference which will be held under the auspices of the Center uh some time during the early part of October on October seven if I 'm not mistaken  \n\n\nThis progress and advance is good for the life of the mind and for Filipino historical scholarship\n\n\nThis is because as you progress and advance in your promotion of the study of the local human experience of the Filipino people you enable scholars to absorb in their minds new and additional information data and interpretations which when shared with the general public will free us from will free us and the people of the Philippines from ignorance and  misconceptions about our past\n\n\nThe faculty and staff of De La Salle University in the field of history are competent persons committed to the promotion of the study of the local and oral history of the Filipinos\n\n\nTherefore nothing is really unfamiliar to you insofar as the human experience of the Filipino is concerned\n\n\nThough you may be unhappy with much that has been wrought by us as a people and as human beings as true intellectuals committed to the search for truth you cannot afford to shy away from the study of anything associated with the Filipino human experience\n\n\nI realize therefore that you still need a lot of things to cover in your research agenda\n\n\nFilipino historians today already take for granted the value of local history for purposes of acquiring a true understanding of Philippine civilization\n\n\nThere is a widespread acceptance by scholars in the historical profession both here and abroad regarding the primary importance of local history in enabling us to portray reality accurately and interestingly\n\n\n  At this point I 'd like to give uh two examples uh to  to illustrate uh the virtue of uh local history, as uh widely accepted by scholars both in the Philippines and abroad\n\n\nFor example uh, in uh the book uh written by uh Jose Maria Sison entitled uh Philippine Society and Revolution there is uh, a conclusion made or one of the conclusions made by the author pertains to the feudal situation in the Philippines\n\n\nUh uh what he tries to do actually is to uh, apply the concept of feudalism to the Philippine situation based on uh, logical inference and based on uh, intuition and  oftentimes based on uh rhetoric but without being based on empirical uh data or scientific evidence\n\n\nAnd uh and actually, as a result of this uh, uh there is a popular notion among uh many Filipinos about the fact that the situation in the Philippines during the nineteenth century for example and even during the twentieth century can be characterized as feudal or semi-feudal\n\n\nHowever uh two American uh two foreign scholars for example uh Jonathan and Fast have written uh a book entitled uh Roots of Dependency and uh on the basis of their study of the forces that were operating in the Philippines during the nineteenth century and during the uh twentieth century with focus on the development of the sugar industry and the  haciendas  in Negros which is one of the local areas here in the Philippines uh, uh Jonathan and Fast in their book the Roots of Dependency have arrived at the conclusion that the situation in the Philippines was far from feudal or semi-feudal\n\n\nRather uh there was actually uh capitalism that was operating although of course the capitalist system or the capitalist forces that were operating were exploitative insofar as native labor was concerned\n\n\nAnd uh the the finding of Jonathan and Fast uh is a uh negation in effect of the simplistic conclusion arrived at by Jose Maria Sison in his uh book uh Philippine Society and Revolution\n\n\nAnother example that I can give uh pertains to Bicol and uh the book uh pertaining to Bicol actually uh was written by another foreign scholar\n\n\nHis name is Norman G Owen\n\n\nHe has written a book entitled uh uh the uh Abaca Industry in in Bicol and Prosperity without Progress or words to that effect\n\n\nAnd uh and uh in effect uh his conclusion is that uh in Bicol as a result of the uh linking up of uh the abaca plantations that were  that were uh formed and uh established and which were linked up with the international uh capitalist markets in uh other countries or abroad, a measure of uh prosperity was enjoyed by the people of uh the Bicol peninsula in contrast to the usual sweeping or facile generalization that uh colonialism uh was uh detrimental to the welfare of the people of uh, all parts of the Philippines\n\n\nBut in the specific case of Bicol uh Norman Owen actually found out that uh there was prosperity and that uh to a large extent colonialism was responsible in promoting this prosperity and that uh there was uh satisfaction on the part of uh the uh people of Bicol with regard to the existence of the colonial system as they knew it uh in the Bicol peninsula because of the opportunity that this gave them to link up with the capitalist markets for purposes of exporting their products their product namely abaca which was uh in great demand in the foreign market\n\n\nSo these two examples uh that I 've given you illustrate uh the primary virtue of uh of of local history for purposes of uh of uh, looking at uh specific regions or looking at particular areas in order to uh understand the underlying detail and the underlying uh reality uh taking place uh within uh these specific areas or localities \n\n\nAnd oftentimes we see that uh the reality that we find out in the local areas that we study and that we subject to local historical scholarship the reality is in contrast to the oftentimes facile generalizations made in uh national histories\n\n\nThis is because uh from the point of view of scholars advocating local history uh local history itself represents a grassroots approach that emphasizes the vital human quality of the past, the way people lived felt thought and what their experiences are as a product of their feelings and thoughts  \n\n\nLocal history has been accepted as a good way of exploring the realities of human life at the grassroots and thus gives the discipline of history a socio-behavioral dimension\n\n\nThe spread of local history represents the major development in Philippine historiography during the past generation\n\n\nThis is not to say that there was no local history before the war\n\n\nThere was local history in the pre-war period but it spread in the post-war period and especially within the past twenty years or so was phenomenal\n\n\nBased on my observation of Philippine historiography the spread of local history took place because of the influence of what is known as the \" new history \" on Filipino scholars\n\n\nNew history emerged because of the realization by scholars that things must be looked up in the round\n\n\nThe advocates of new history reacted against the dominance in past historiography of historians who stressed political history\n\n\nHowever the new historians who distinguish themselves as economic or social historians as seen apart from political historians insisted that the political facts habitually included within the historian 's purview told only part of the story and were themselves not to be fully understood in the absence of economic and social facts\n\n\nThe advocates of new history equip themselves with intellectual and  methodological tools drawn from the social sciences as well as from the humanities but mainly from the former\n\n\nThey are committed to studying history from the bottom up rather than from the top down\n\n\nSo that in effect this represents a major shift in focus from top level history to the grassroots approach\n\n\nThey are interested in studying the grassroots of civilization and in the process they inevitably face the question of how the masses had lived and thought and reacted in the past\n\n\nThis new breed of historians in the Philippines for example had begun to realize that whereas they had considerable information about Manila-based rulers and how they had exercised their power they the new historians had little or none about the people in the countryside and how they responded\n\n\nMoreover there was recognition that previous historians had known something about the literary and artistic highlights going on in Manila but little of the mass culture from where these highlights stood out\n\n\nIn other words very little was known about the manner of living and the processes of change going on which affected the multitudes out in the villages and towns of the Philippines\n\n\nIt was recognized that the values and experiences of the villagers and townspeople were at variance with those of the dominant elites based in Manila\n\n\nThus this led to the increasing emphasis by Filipino historians in the study of local history\n\n\nAnd this further led to the founding of the national conference of national conference on local history in nineteen seventy-eight in which Dr Foronda Dr Churchill Dr Samuel K Tan Dr Resill B Mojaris Dr Mamitua D Saber and the late Professor Alfredo T Tiamson played a significant and leading role\n\n\nThis annual conference has since then become the foremost venue or forum for the presentation of the latest trends and findings in Philippine local history\n\n\nAfter the first conference that took place in nineteen seventy-eight in Cagayan de Oro a conference took place in uh Dumaguete City in nineteen seventy-nine in Bacolod in nineteen eighty in Cebu City in nineteen eighty-one in Iligan City in nineteen eighty-two in Quezon City in nineteen eighty-four in Surigao City in nineteen eighty-five in General Santos City in nineteen eighty-seven in Butuan City in nineteen eighty-eight again in General Santos in nineteen eighty-nine and uh last year nineteen ninety uh it was held in Naga City and this year it 's going to be held in Marawi City with the papers generated by this important scholarly gathering, published in the Journal of History of the Philippine National Historical Society, \n\n\nThe institutionalization of the Local and Oral History Center at De La Salle University is further proof that local history is here to stay\n\n\nThis is complemented by the establishment and existence in different parts of the Philippines of such regional study centers like the Center for Northern Luzon Studies at Saint Mary 's College in Bayombong Nueva Ecija, the Center for Leyte Samar Studies at Divine Word University in Tacloban City the Center for Negrense Studies at the University of Saint La Salle in Bacolod City the Cebuano Studies Center at the University of San Carlos in Cebu City the Center for Western Visayan Studies at U P Visayas in Iloilo City the Research Institute for Mindanao Culture at Xavier University in Cagayan de Oro City and the Ethnic Samal Studies Center at Mindanao State University in Tawi-Tawi not to mention the Cordillera Studies Center in U P Baguio and uh the uh Sharif Kabungsuan Cultural and Studies Center in Cotabato City\n\n\nWith regard to oral history, oral literature and popular literature I can say that they are useful in shedding valuable light on the values attitudes and experiences of the non-literate many or the inarticulate and  semi-literate masses of Filipino society as well as on the processes of social change affecting them\n\n\nWithin the context of the agrarian tradition of the Philippines one cannot be content interpreting past change only from the evidence of official records written by the dominant elites in politics and in the economy\n\n\nThe oral and popular literature of the people will surely give illumination to the lives and activities of what we call the common  tao  or Juan de la Cruz\n\n\n And uh let me cite the oral history project uh headed by Dr Foronda himself under the auspices of De La Salle University uh towards the furtherance of uh of oral history not only as a methodology but as a component uh towards uh shedding valuable light on how we as a people uh live uh in our uh daily existence  \n\n\nThe field or discipline of anthropology in particular will be will be and in fact is most useful to the Filipino historian in his quest for a better understanding of the oral and popular literature of the Philippines for purposes of illuminating the life and experiences of the masses\n\n\nThis is because the anthropologists do not generally have pre-conceptions about the societies they seek to study and because they view the culture of a society as an integral whole\n\n\nUseful to the local and oral historian in his quest for an understanding of the grassroots of Filipino civilization is folklore as a source of social history\n\n\nThis is because in folklore we see the people as human beings and we see them being both the historians as well as the history in which they tell their own story in their own words\n\n\nHistory and folklore are inextricably bound because they do not simply have a common ground but they are actually one and the same ground\n\n\nThrough this interrelationship we are able to gain insight into the emotions and consciousness of the people and communities we are studying\n\n\nWe also go to the roots and sources of society in which the people are living\n\n\nAt the same time this interdisciplinary mode of analysis that local and  oral history engenders does not deflect us from the day-to-day needs of the people of the Philippines\n\n\nWe know that resources are scarce which means that local historians must likewise be devoting their attention to environmental change and to such questions like do they still see their forebears as still in possession of their forest lands or are they finding them displaced and is is there anything being done\n\n\nIn other words we who are engaged in local and oral history while we should value and support our traditions and heritage as a people must not lose sight of the fact that the Philippines has serious socio-economic political and environmental problems\n\n\nAnd therefore we must also devote our attention towards doing scientific and empirical research within the framework of local and oral history, research that will have results which can serve as inputs toward the formulation of new policies including alternative policies that will bring greater benefit", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f3a2a944-63ce-4bb9-9ca4-43578bfcd1ab", "added":

{"text": "<$A> \n\n Thank you very much Secretary Romulo\n\n\nSecretary Camacho and the other Philippine participants in this Consultative Group Meeting Mr Pooley and the other members of the O D A community friends from Pampanga ladies and gentlemen \n\n\nI would like to welcome the representatives of the international donor community our partners in development to the Philippines and to this conference\n\n\nWe are honored to host this meeting the Philippines that is for the second time\n\n\nThank you for your support and enduring faith in our country\n\n\nWhen I became President last year I said that we want to win the battle against poverty within the decade\n\n\nOur vision of eradicating poverty within the decade is anchored on a comprehensive medium-term Philippine Development Plan\n\n\nThis plan revolves around four major components\n\n\nThe first is an economic philosophy of free enterprise appropriate to the twenty-first century\n\n\nWe believe that this philosophy will create more jobs in the sectors and areas that count most to ease the burden of the poor\n\n\nThe second component is a modernized agricultural sector founded on social equity\n\n\nThis will bring economic development to the rural areas where most of the poor live\n\n\nThe third component is a social bias toward the disadvantaged to balance our economic development plan\n\n\nThis will bring immediate relief to the longest-sufferers in the fringes of society\n\n\nThe fourth component is to raise the moral standards of government and society\n\n\nWe started implementing our development plan even before the document was printed\n\n\nWe have been guided by real visible and measurable targets most of which are contained in my first State of the Nation Address before Congress last year\n\n\nAllow me to mention a few accomplishments\n\n\nEconomic growth last year created more than two million jobs reducing both unemployment and underemployment and exceeding the targets in our plan\n\n\nWhile the economies of most of our neighbors suffered declines last year as mentioned by Mr Pooley ours posted a three point four percent growth in G D P and a three point seven percent growth in G N P\n\n\nOur G D P growth surpassed all expectations including our own\n\n\nWe actually posted one of the highest output growth rates in East and Southeast Asia\n\n\nInflation was contained at six point one percent last year very close to the lower end of our target and inflation for February this year was at three point four percent the lowest in two years\n\n\nInterest rates have gone down to their lowest in fifteen years and they can be expected to trigger an increase in economic activities\n\n\nThe peso has also stabilized relative to the dollar\n\n\nThe budget deficit was limited to a hundred forty-seven billion pesos while pursuing our priorities and without sacrificing our core values which include job creation agricultural modernization housing and education\n\n\nOur message is clear\n\n\nGovernment will keep the deficit within reasonable range\n\n\nI targeted twenty billion pesos a year for the implementation of the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act\n\n\nBut in actuality more than twenty-eight billion has been spent so far\n\n\nI targeted security of land tenure to a hundred fifty thousand urban poor families and a hundred thousand rural farming families and they have already been granted that\n\n\nMore than thirty-four thousand low-salaried workers have already been given financial assistance for their housing needs\n\n\nWe have already identified the more than one thousand six hundred  barangays  where we will construct school buildings so that all  barangays  will have a school by twenty oh four\n\n\nWe have exceeded our target for health insurance coverage for the urban poor by more than eighty-five percent\n\n\nWe have moved towards greater transparency in awarding contracts\n\n\nThese have to be bidded out rather than negotiated\n\n\nWe have computerized the bidding in public works\n\n\nWe have exceeded the target set for the number of agencies to be registered under the electronic procurement system \n\n The result from all these, honest and faster contract awards\n\n\nWe have infused in government to a great degree common sense discipline and accountability in management and public service\n\n\nCivil society is in loop\n\n\nPrivate sector groups have set up Procurement  Watch which has been sanctioned to check the integrity of government purchases\n\n\nThe Report Card Survey Project periodically measures public attitudes toward the delivery of services\n\n\nTax Watch monitors the internal revenue service\n\n\nThe Volunteers against Crime and Corruption monitor the transactions of the Department of Public Works and Highways\n\n\nWe have stabilized the domestic political situation while continuing to mop up residual problems of law and order\n\n\nWe are putting in an additional two hundred million pesos into an effort to bolster our capability against kidnapping\n\n\nWe will set up more operational teams exclusively focused on this threat\n\n\nWe shall back up these teams with better surveillance equipment\n\n\nSome sectors are trying to create an impression quite erroneous that the government is being wishy-washy in dealing with the political posturings of former President Estrada who is under trial by the graft court\n\n\nI want to firmly dispel any impression that the government is engaged in any strategy of appeasement or compromise on this matter\n\n\nWhile I have said that the decision on any pending issue before the court is up to the court to decide this does not mean that the executive will take a passive stance against any attempt to deliberately undermine the court subvert allegiance to it or impede its rightful duties\n\n\nMy duty as President is to defend the Constitution and this extends to the defense of the great powers of government the executive judiciary and the legislature\n\n\nWe will not stand by while any or all of these institutions are under threat\n\n\nThe judiciary in particular has ample means to ward off nuisances and legalistic posturings but when there is a brazen attempt to destroy the credibility and functionality of any court of justice this calls for the concerted action by all institutions of democratic government and for that matter all the citizens of the democratic system\n\n\nBoth the Supreme Court and the leaders of the legislature have called upon the former President to confine his cause or struggle within the ambit of the court\n\n\nI have joined them in this call\n\n\nThe Presidency will not stand aside in the face of insidious machinations to take the struggle out of the courtroom and try to evolve it into a conspiracy to foment public disorder and undermine the people 's allegiance to the Constitution and the system of justice\n\n\nThe defense of the Constitution and the rule of law are non-negotiable\n\n\nThese cannot be the stuff of popularity or partisan contests\n\n\nAll subterranean conspiracies shall stand down or face the full retribution of Constitutional authority\n\n\nOn the other horizon the decisiveness by which we shall continue to enforce the rule of law is only matched by our consistency and unswerving determination to keep the economy on track\n\n\nWe have much much more to do to enable the poor to catch up\n\n\nThe wealth gap must be closed\n\n\nGrowth statistics are meaningless to the jobless\n\n\nLow inflation is irrelevant to the penniless\n\n\nA reduced budget deficit cannot be an argument to butter up the morale of hungry people\n\n\nWith this pressing concern in mind we chose  Matapat na Pamamahala Tugon sa Kahirapan  or Winning the War against Poverty through Good Governance as the theme of this year 's  Consultative Group Meeting as it was the theme of our EDSA anniversary celebrations\n\n\n Matapat na Pamamahala  is loosely translated as Good Governance but it means much more\n\n\nIt means caring being accountable and being open and transparent\n\n\nIt connotes loyalty honesty and being true to one 's office\n\n\n Matapat na Pamamahala  is the key to the door of broader prosperity without it even the best-laid development plan is doomed to fail\n\n\nBut with  Matapat na Pamamahala  government will devote its entire being spirit and resource to deliver the poor from the clutches of poverty\n\n\nWe have no illusions about the gigantic challenge ahead\n\n\nAll leaders from three continents I have consulted over the past year are one in saying that resolving poverty needs the combined, resources of the entire planet to succeed\n\n\nIt needs the combined efforts of all the well-meaning governments and institutions of the world and it brooks no delay\n\n\nA global alliance can be forged to wage war against poverty and we should forge this alliance just as we forged an alliance against the scourge of terrorism\n\n\nI thank you all for being there to help us as we navigated our economy from troubled seas to calmer waters last year\n\n\nI trust that you will continue to be by our side as we proceed our country through buffeting storms and uncertainties that, have that  have characterized the world economy\n\n\nWe have used the official development assistance your governments and institutions have extended to help effect key reforms and to finance the budget deficit and major infrastructure and human development investments\n\n\nIn all these I assure you that we are spending on the right things and living within our means\n\n\nWe are unlocking key bottlenecks that have hampered the use of O D A in the past year \n\n\nThis is what I did when I was at the helm of the Department of Social Welfare and Development before I became President and this is what I am doing now for the entire government\n\n\nWe are integrating process and action more sharply\n\n\nWe are meeting with project managers as often as we can\n\n\nWe are monitoring their prompt implementation of our decisions and we are working under concrete time frames of compliance\n\n\nWe need more legislation to unlock some bottlenecks\n\n\nWe will continue to work with congress to clear the track forward\n\n\nAll systems are moving forward\n\n\nWe know where we are headed and we are trying to mark the milestones as we painstakingly traverse them\n\n\nOur vehicle is in good running condition and judging from what Mr Pooley said in his welcoming remarks I hope you believe that we have a competent driver behind the steering wheel  \n\n\nBut we need all the extra fuel we can stock to go the full distance  \n\n\nI trust that you will continue to extend us the much needed assistance the extra fuel for the journey 's continuity so that we can reach our goal of poverty-free Philippines and contribute to a poverty-free world within the decade\n\n\nOn this note let me thank you once again for the privilege of welcome you welcoming you\n\n\n Mabuhay  and we may we all meet success in this meeting\n\n\nThank you", "subdomain": "PHILIPPINES_S_ALL", "source":

and Manpower Development of the Kingdom of Lusaka Minister uh  Lanola  Reverend Father Salazar Chairman of the Resolutions Committee and President of the COCOPEA and Commissioner uh Mona Valisno Chairperson of this World Congress nineteen ninety-seven the uh honorable members of the Philippine Senate and the the House of Representatives our congressmen and the congressmen and congresswomen of this World Congress of nineteen ninety-seven  Your Excellencies of the diplomatic corps and international organizations and other co-workers in the government other special guests  mga kababayan at mga kapatid  ladies and gentlemen\n\n\nFirst of all let me assure you that my speech will not be as long as the Manila Declaration  \n\n\nHaving just returned from a hectic series of visits to the United Kingdom Oman and Greece all in just nine days it truly is an energizing event to be in this distinguished company back here at home in the Philippines\n\n\n In fact I still have the dust of the Acropolis in my shoes because I came directly from <unclear> word </unclear>, but one thing I learned from our short visit to Greece the cradle of democracy and the home of ancient civilization which still influences us to this day <unclear> word </unclear> higher education we must make sure that education does not go to our heads but to our minds  di ko yata naintindihan yun 'a   \n\n\n Translating  education is okay  \n\n\nThis gathering of many of the world 's leading educators and human resource development executives both in the public and in the private sector is indeed a great honor for us \n\n Your dialogues discussions papers resolutions and declarations reflect the anticipation of the global community of a new era of greater interaction cooperation and benefit among the eminent personalities and academic institutions represented here and on a larger scale the various stakeholders in the worldwide knowledge society including the children after us\n\n\nOur common quest for peace and prosperity has been accelerated by the advancement of telecommunications linking communities across the globe and overcoming the economic and cultural barriers among and between peoples the world over\n\n\nSuch a form of networking my dear friends among human societies has made possible the greater integration of knowledge and the exchange of cultural and technological information enabling people to make better decisions from a wider range of options\n\n\nOur shared aspirations for a better world have led to the development of new modes of cooperation not only among governments but also among subcultures within our societies\n\n\nInternational networks have become significant not only for the exchange of information but more so as mechanisms for  cooperative action and policy formulation and advocacy\n\n\n We 're seeing  the opportunities for subcultures and remote communities to learn and act across traditional national and ethnic boundaries\n\n\nThese networks represent the strength of hitherto unconnected communities asserting now the right to participate in policy decisions affecting their futures\n\n\nAll over the world these opportunities have become challenges in many forms and they have manifested themselves in the hard decisions that lie before our educators and educational managers\n\n\n<unclear> words </unclear> teachers for example have been called upon to be more efficient more relevant more forward-looking and more learner-focused \n\n\nAt the same time we need to deal with such issues as sustainable development quality and excellence equal opportunity human rights integration of technology and the cultural content of learning as evidenced by uh your reports and your compendiums which I received by fax even while I was abroad\n\n\nThere is a growing universal concern that higher education has found it harder to keep its traditional position at the forefront of human resource and national development\n\n\nHigher education in most countries including the Philippines is in some kind of crisis and this has been brought about by the rapid increases in enrollment and the declining capacity of governments to sustain budgetary support to higher educational institutions\n\n\nEducation is clearly under pressure to respond to changing global economic and social conditions\n\n\nIt has had to reengineer and take advantage of information technology to globalize and decentralize in the same manner that corporations have to do\n\n\nIndeed as some experts suggest transnational education may be the logical outcome of as well as a primary factor in the intensification of global interconnectedness\n\n\nFurthermore education should increasingly be viewed as a commodity to be shaped according to consumer demand\n\n\nThis perception of education as a market product or service provider creates a new focus on the requirements of the students and the job market thus enabling  preferences to be embedded into the learning environment and given top priority\n\n\nUnder this scenario educators just like businessmen need to be more flexible and overcome the structural rigidities of traditional institutions\n\n\nFor teachers as well as learners this raises important and fundamental questions challenges and choices\n\n\nFor instance what is education about\n\n\nHow is it best delivered and by whom and who pays the bills and how can they be reduced without sacrificing quality\n\n\nThis international congress must address these three questions alongside such vital issues as assuring excellence and quality the roles of universities and colleges in the twenty first century new leadership roles cost effective resource management borderless learning mechanisms application of multimedia technologies modalities of financing higher education institutions internationalization of higher education and mutual recognition and comparability of credentials\n\n\nGovernments all over the world have adjusted with varying degrees of commitment to the challenge of survival and relevance of higher education institutions and are doing what they can to provide sustain if not increase support\n\n\nThese are solid steps forward but we all need to do more\n\n\nRecent and comprehensive studies suggest that if higher education has to rethink its mission then it must be with the social environment defined by political democratization economic globalization regional trade agreements social and regional polarization  discrimination  of various social groups and cultural fragmentation\n\n\nWe are all urged to review and to reform existing structures and practices in higher education where necessary\n\n\nAccepting the challenge of sustainable development for example will imply that higher education institutions must reexamine their relationships to the economy and to social realities their organizational structures and their funding and spending modalities\n\n\nDeveloping countries in particular face the dual challenges of improving their human resources and reducing poverty levels\n\n\nIn this context higher education and research are seen as extremely important factors in development policy\n\n\nHigher education and human resources development in the Asia Pacific for the twenty-first century are critical concerns which were addressed not too long ago by leaders of eighteen member economies in the Asia Pacific region during the APEC Summit hosted by the Philippines last November nineteen ninety-six\n\n\nAt that historic gathering the leaders renewed their commitment to enriching the lives and to improving the standards of living of all citizens in the Asia Pacific region on a sustainable basis and this world congress brings the effort yet another step forward\n\n\nIn the Asia Pacific governments have supported the closer integration of education research and development and information technology and the strategies that go with it with the requirements of the globalizing economy\n\n\nMany Southeast Asian countries have indicated in concrete terms the levels of investment they are willing to commit to these activities\n\n\nWe can anticipate that before the century turns massive new investments shall have been made in enriching and sharpening our people 's skills and talents\n\n\nThe mutual recognition of skills qualifications and standards of professional practice has been a continuing top priority concern of the APEC working group on human resources development\n\n\nHere in the Philippines as you already know we have created the Commission on Higher Education CHED and the Higher Education Development Fund H E D F to undertake whatever reforms may be necessary to bring our standards over time up to par with the world 's best learning institutions\n\n\nThis surge is what we envisage for the Philippines\n\n\nWe have adopted what we call our pole-vaulting strategy to diminish the gap between ourselves and our more prosperous neighbors and then to move ahead\n\n\nCentral to this strategy will be the establishment of the Philippines as an education and knowledge center in the Asia Pacific\n\n\nI like to add the objectives also of making the Philippines a maritime power and a medical center in East Asia among others\n\n\nThese are just some of the competitive niches that we have identified for ourselves in the global economy\n\n\nThis means capitalizing on and optimizing our basic strengths and distinct advantages our open society our archipelagic setting and strategic location astride the two great oceans of commerce the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea our adaptable workforce and our strength in services such as information technology or knowledge-based <unclear> words </unclear> enterprises\n\n\nWe must give the highest priority to intensifying and speeding up reforms that free the market to prepare the ground for faster and sustained economic growth and social development\n\n\nBut to attain global excellence in our chosen niches we must emphasize and encourage innovation by promoting a culture of creativity productivity and excellence in both the public and the private sectors\n\n\nWe must set for ourselves the specific objectives that are high enough to be meaningful and should stand out as ambitious even among the East Asian tiger economies\n\n\nThat is why for our pole-vaulting strategy we in the Philippines have chosen the Olympic motto  citius fortius altius  faster stronger and higher\n\n\nIn all of this we place the highest value on education which we realize has always been one of our strongest resources\n\n\nThus this Congress is a great source of interest and inspiration for all of us\n\n\nJudging by the superior quality of the papers presented  and the number of declarations to which you have agreed in this Congress I have no doubt my dear friends that you have <unclear> words </unclear> more significant, contributions to mankind 's search for new knowledge and the attainment of the true potentials of the individual\n\n\nI am extremely pleased to know that at this congress various memoranda of agreement and understanding were reached between and among Ministries of Education in countries such as Canada Thailand and others with our Philippine Commission on Higher Education\n\n\nThese agreements should enable our colleges and universities to cooperate and work more easily and more fruitfully with one another\n\n\nIn closing let me also commend the Congress organizers for bringing together in Manila the Ministers of Education the presidents of leading universities in the world and the most eminent experts on human resource development\n\n\nIn behalf of our people and our government I thank you all for your support and selfless efforts towards enriching the minds and the futures of all our peoples and of humankind as a whole\n\n\nThank you\n\n\n
